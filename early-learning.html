        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

The indication in many recent reports is that it is normal to 
                      have <A HREF="adhesions.html#start">epithelial adhesions</A> at the age of 17. This idea originates 
                      from one frequently quoted but much misunderstood study by <A HREF="re_oster.html#start">&Oslash;ster</A> where the last remains of adhesions at 17 were reported - but the 
                    boys in question were never asked how they felt about their condition. 
                            <P>In this almost entirely unstudied subject it appears the only 
                              published case history comes from <A HREF="anthropology/bettelheim.html#start">Bettelheim <FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">in "Symbolic Wounds"</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> reporting on a boy of 13 </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> where  "painful adhesions 
                              interfered with full functioning of the penis".</FONT></P>
                            <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">I interviewed one man who had epithelial adhesions throughout 
                              his puberty, he reported<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> pain 
                                during erection as intense or immanent. He requested circumcision 
                                at 13 yrs. old and was advised to "wait and see what happens" by 
                                his doctors. He limited his enjoyment and exploration to manipulating 
                                the phallus by gently stroking or applying pressure to the area 
                                round the glans. He was eventually circumcised after a renewed request 
                            as soon as he was legally eligable at 18.</FONT></FONT>

                          <P>This is a situation which could excite considerable thought among 
                            psychologists. The pain from adhesions occurs prior to and as a 
                            more elementary influence than the castration or Oedipal complexes 
                            and most of the recognised traumatic phases of a baby boy`s development. 
                          <P>The effect of this genital pain during the first year after birth 
                            would probably be minimal. But when this continues as a repeated 
                            experience over the first four or five years of a boys life, we 
                            would expect adverse developments. We would expect the boy to learn 
                            that his foreskin and his erection were to some extent untouchable. 
                          <P>It is understood that a boy or youth is easily impressionable, 
                            he will have interests and also some fears about sex, these fears 
                            can easily be supported by painful or difficult genital complaints. 
                          <P>Due to pain being associated with something wrong, bad or stupid, 
                    he might easily understand the sensation as indicating retraction 
                    of the foreskin was stupid or his erections were bad.
                          <P><B>Even before puberty has begun, this anatomical phenomenon undermines 
                            a boy experimenting, finding out about, being aware of and growing 
                            up being comfortable with the most essential element of his anatomical 
                            maleness.</B>
                          <P>All such learn processes may be easily reversed, but is it necessary 
                            to start any learning process by taking the first step in such a 
                            pointless and unconstructive direction? </P>
                          <P><B>The earlier a boy can start to develop a comfortable relationship 
                            with his essential physical and anatomical maleness; the more chance 
                            there is that his sexual identity will develop in an integrated 
                            manner; enabling him to become relaxed and comfortable as a man.</B></P>
                          <P><B>The adhesions must be released, as early as possible, to promote 
                            the development of a boy's healthy sexual relationship with himself 
                            ... and subsequently with others.</B></P>

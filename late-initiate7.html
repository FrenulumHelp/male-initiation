  sexuality appears to contradict every advance in understanding which our culture 
  has made over the last century. - Psychological research has concentrated on parental 
          and environmental phenomenon, and the urological disciplines do not 
          include sexual behaviour. Scientific research has overlooked this area 
          of human sexuality. </FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                                  <TD WIDTH="281"><P>A man's ability to develop a healthy intimate relationship with 
                                    the opposite sex is based to a large extent on his intimate relationship 
                                    with his own body. If an individual avoids the discomfort or difficulty 
                                    associated with his essential physical manhood, his experience of what 
                                    defines him as man is mixed with avoidance, how can he develop a realistic 
                                    sense of being a man? This inevitably generates an element of nervousness 
                                    in any intimate contact. 
                                    <P>If the man believes that &quot;I am normal&quot; it is a perfectly 
                                      logical consequence for him to project the problem on his parents, 
                                      or his girlfriends.         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                            <P>(<I>Again</I> I realise many people may be anxious 
                              or nervous about sex for many other complicated psychological reasons; 
                              here we are discussing the functionality of the erection when it is 
                              impaired, a simple anatomical fact of life which has been overlooked 
                              and a number of fully unnecessary extra problems which could have been 
                              easily prevented).                    
                            <P>The penis being touched by another person is an area which will often 
                              cause problems. If a fear of touching has developed through 
                              other pre-puberty experiences (e.g. mother never touching - mother 
                              touching too much) then the condition will confirm this fear.                 
                            <P>Intimate 
                              relationships will be more successful with women who are not interested 
                              in touching or playing with the man`s penis. (One young man who was 
                              aware of painful frenulum without realising there was a cure, adapted 
                              his behaviour by simply telling girl friends not to touch him there).                  
                            <P>As a way of gaining integrity in one`s image of self and the world; 
                              a fair number of those with such inhibitng conditions believe they 
                              are never meant to marry or have intercourse. The feeling of not wanting 
                              sex before marriage or even never being meant to have sex is frequently 
                              expressed. Mutual love and trust are especially important pre-requisites 
                              in order to be relaxed in intimate contact. Even when emotional trust 
                              is available, sex would tend to be at some sort of distance, for example 
                              masturbation and voyeurism.</P>

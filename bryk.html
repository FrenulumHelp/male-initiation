          male circumcision. Most of the literature shows no awareness 
          of phimosis - its frequency - or the sexual and erectile problems which can be cured by circumcision. If routine circumcision 
          had been introduced for this most obvious reason of eliminating difficult 
          foreskins; then the importance of an alternative modern method, suitable to our culture's attitudes in this day and age, would be clear. </FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                                    for circumcision is not difficult to derive from the nature of sexuality.
                                    <P>Men strive to make the often complicated sexual act as comfortable 
                                      as possible; and it is beyond discussion, that in this the foreskin 
                                      often places a decided restriction in the way, which is sometimes even 
                                      painful, for after penetration the glans can be strangulated, which 
                                      complicates the act, or, when the prepuce does not lay the glans bare, 
                                      which accelerates the <I>ejaculatio seminis</I><I>. </I>What could 
                                      be more obvious than to remove this obstacle, especially since by doing

                                      <P>&quot;The boy, constrained by his foreskin complex often experiences 
                                        disapointment as a result of this, he had imagined that the foreskin 
                                        would go further backwards, as shown by the examples of the erection 
                                        of the dog, horse or bull,but now he notices that the frenulum, 
                                        the ligament joining the blade of the foreskin with the glans and penis,prevents any further backwards movement. He conceives the idea 
                                        of cutting through the frenulum. Perhaps he had already heard from 
                                        his older comrades in suffering, that due to its shortness it sometimes 
                                        rips during coitus.&quot;         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                                    There can be no doubt that even in the dark beginnings of time, surgical

                                    then it is certain even in those times, that congenital phimosis occurred 
                                    manifesting in the manner, that physiologically, the inner blade of 
                                    the foreskin did not release from the glans or the opening of the foreskin 
                                    was so narrow, that the prepuce could never be retracted behind the 
                                    glans. Additionally acquired phimosis and phimosis of old-age must 
                                    have received operative removal in those days, as in today`s healing

        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>

                                The pouting nozzle   of an infant phimosis is easily recognisable. 
                                This is normal and natural, and even babies will play and pull the 
                                tube (the &quot;dophin nose&quot;) forward. This is all common and 
                                normal in infants, and possibly also a healthy first natural step 
                                to releasing the epithelial adhesions. 
                            <P>Adults often retain a degree of this tube, when flaccid (non erect), 
                                and it is usually no problem. Occasionally, and only when in combination 
                                with other conditions, an infant phimosis remains unopened during 
                                erection and then it plays part of a more complex sexual problem. 
                            <P><B><A HREF="adhesions.html#start">INFANT ADHESIONS - (EPITHELIAL 
                                ADHESIONS)</A></B> <BR>
                                Among infants the foreskin may stick entirely or partially to the 
                                glans. This adhesive layer is natural, normal and will generally 
                                release by the age of three, <A HREF="library/xtras/refs.html#ref4">(4)</A>. 
                                Sometimes the adhesive layer does not release in childhood in which 
                                case it is almost always recognised at the beginning of puberty 
                                during erection when the foreskin is peeled (like elastoplast) off 
                                the glans, occasionally any movement of the foreskin is so intensely 
                                painful that it hinders further exploration and development. 
                            <P>Sometimes it does not release by itself a moment of pleasure and 
                                pain discovery is sometimes reported at the beginning of puberty, 
                            <P>They must be carefully released. Not only can this cause intense 
                                pain but the sticky skin surfaces can fuse together again causing skin 
                                bridges. 
                            <P><B><A HREF="skinbridges.html#start">SKIN BRIDGES</A></B><BR>
                                If the infant epithelial adhesions are separated and the fresh sticky 
                                skin surfaces are allowed to rest in contact with each other again, 
                                they can fuse together causing small connecting strings or bands of 
                                skin tissue between the foreskin and the glans: 
                            <P>These unnatural secondary string like growths can occur singly, 
                                in groups or even as a sheet of skin. Skin bridges usually occur singly 
                                among uncircumcised boys, however they are particularly common among 
                                infants given full circumcisions with no post operative check-up, when 
                                they develop in groups between the circumcision scar and the glans. 
                            <P>Their effects are extremely varied depending on where they are. 
                                They are sometimes no problem, at other times very painful and/or even 
                                restrict the full erection. </P>
                              <P><B><A HREF="frenulum_breve.html#start">FRENULUM BREVE</A></B><BR>
                                The frenulum is similar to the joining ridge under the tongue. A 
                                small sheet of skin underneath the glans joins the glans to the 
                                foreskin. On the erect penis, when the frenulum is too short, if 
                                one retracts the foreskin and then lets go, it slides or springs 
                                forward again. The condition is well described as a "tether" <A HREF="library/xtras/refs.html#ref80">(80)</A>, <A HREF="library/xtras/refs.html#ref81">(81)</A>. 
                              <P>This condition is one of potential antagonistic pulls: during erection 
                                the short frenulum tethers the foreskin forward, on the other hand 
                                intercourse, and masturbation exert forces which pull the foreskin 
                                backward. </P>
                              <P>The frenulum has various degrees of brevity and thickness and infinite 
                                variations in positioning, causing a variety of pleasure/pain sensations.                              </P>
                              <P>When masturbating the erection is manually controlled, so the foreskin 
                                can be kept in a forward position and painful movements can be avoided. 
                                Conscious problems start during intercourse.when the foreskin is involuntarily 
                                pulled backwards ... repeatedly (!) 
                              <P>The strain often causes pain, soreness, and bruising for some days 
                                afterwards, or the frenulum can rip. Ripping occurs typically during 
                                first love making often resulting in profuse bleeding. Subsequently 
                                the bleeding surfaces can congeal and the frenulum rejoins even shorter 
                                than previously, sometimes developing an ulcer like scar

                                of the inner foreskin, forming a noose around the glans. 
                            <P>A primary phimotic ring (from birth) will usually stretch; whereas 
                                when a secondary ring develops, it will tighten. LSA, diabetes, old 
                                age, and many other factors can be connected with the development of 
                                a secondary ring.

                                it does rub over the knuckle it hurts and gets sore often becoming 
                                inflamed, or it gets stuck. . A phimotic ring can make retraction

                                Only accurate diagnosis can ensure individual problem related treatment. 
                              <P>A doctor will usually only make a diagnosis in the flaccid state, 
                                this is often inadequate. The bridge, tether and noose conditions 
                                are by nature less elastic and expand relatively less than the rest

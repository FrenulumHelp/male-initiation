        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P>Around the 1850s, &quot;Mental illness was blamed on tight foreskins,... 
                                as was excessive masturbation&quot; <A HREF="library/xtras/refs.html#ref1">(1)</A>. 
                                These phenomena have been misinterpreted and misunderstood, and 
                                even today, ideas which bear any resemblance are often considered 
                                to be deluded, or &quot;complete nonsense&quot; <A HREF="library/xtras/refs.html#ref2">(2)</A>.</P>
                              <P>Regardless of cultural attitudes and expert advice on such matters; 
                                R. Stuart attempts to lead his reader through a minefield of preconceptions, 
                                and establish a deeper understanding of this aspect of male identity.</P>

  "Male Initiation and the Phimosis Taboos" presents the first scientifically 
                                based and most detailed collection of information in the world's 
                                literature, on the subject of male sexual problems due to foreskin 
                                malformations.</P>
                              <P>I hope this work will be valued for its new ideas, and its contribution 
                                to the existing literature on prevention as being appropriate to 
                                modern attitudes in health care.</P>

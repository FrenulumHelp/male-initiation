        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                            <P>One of  the most bizarre developments of modern medicine  is Routine Infant Circumcsion. In the USA a 
                              full circumcision is often practised previous to the mother holding 
                              her new born baby.</P>
                            <P>It must surely be one of the greatest examples of cultural negligence 
                              to first surgically intefere with a child's natural development, and then make no post-operative 
                              examination. </P>

                              lots of lubrication, it has always been too painful for me. . ... I 
                              have found that the anxiety produced by expecting pain, immediately 
                              ends the possibility of intercourse. ... I was so tightly circumcised, 
                              that I wasn't aware that it was even normal for the skin to be able

                                                some seven skin bridges ... connecting the glans with the shaft. .... 
                                                My erect penis was a little bit curved on the right, ... One of the 
                                                skin bridges broke during love-making (when I was 26) ... skin bridges 
                                                were removed when I was 32.  (<I>RS. after they were removed the 
                                                  phallus straightened out</I>). I was really asking myself - especially 
                    during puberty - what are these "skin bridges" ?, are they normal ?

        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              of pure hell (painful infected penis, or embarrassment & terror caused 
                              by clumsy, insensitive doctors who yanked the foreskin back while muttering 
                              about smegma & my need to be circumcised) followed by months of inattention 
                              (benign neglect?)."

                                        and stretched daily but after a few days my mother gave up because 
                                        I couldn't bear the pain and kept on crying. So, any treatment was 
                                        forgotten and I continued to grow up with my phimosis."

                                                  years old. At this point he suggested a circumcision but wanted to

                    do this by our pediatrician. I was mortified. .... I came across your 
                    website, and am very happy to have found it. We have noticed our son 
                    naturally stretching his penis- we never knew why. Now we do. - We 
                  just want to thank you."

                                                            and advised me to continue this practice. My husband did so twice but 
                                                            it seemed to cause my son so much pain that I insisted that we stop. 
                                                            I contacted the pediatrician again and he stood by his recommendation

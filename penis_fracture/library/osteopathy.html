    <p>March 2016<br>
      i believe after 20 yrs. i found at least part of the answer : </p>
    <p>over the last few years the right groin started hurting all the time again twice after doing a particular physiotherapy exercise (pulling the leg back from over the shoulder with help of a towell round the ankle) - so i went to an Osteopath with this story. </p>
    <p>The Osteopath pushed back &quot;a fold of skin&quot; which was trapped underneath one of the lower hip bones ... &quot;the inferior ramus of the pubis&quot; (underneath, not above as in a hernia)... it seems nerves were trapped there ... For a month i had very few problems, then it started again, ... but this time the osteopath could not relate to the idea of the basic injury being caused by anything to do with the penis and couldnt help. He used only whole body treatments (eg. holding my waist side, or head or feet) - insisting he was sensitive to the problem .. very frustrating ... </p>
    <p>I need this fold of skin pushing right back in ... I have tried 2 other osteopaths - one, a woman, seemed to understand the problem but knows only a gentle form of Osteopathy ... </p>
    <p>it makes me crazy how men, even medical professionals, often seem to get blocked when it comes to thinking about the penis... yes, you know, its been a long history of bad treatment ... and so i cant finish this story at present ... i am still working on it ... </p>
    <p>... (i feel pretty sure that my form of this trapped-nerve problem is similar to that which some weight lifters experience.) ... </p>
    <p><strong>The point is that now, after 20 years - at last I have a diagnosis, and the experience of a cure that works ...</strong>    </p>

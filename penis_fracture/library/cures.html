    <P>... during the first 6 months when my pain was most intensive, the only relief I could find was lying on my back with my knees up and resting knees together (this takes pressure off the groin area) - then smearing the area full with <STRONG>anaesthetic cream</STRONG> turned the intense pain into a dull pain and I was able to then relax a little ... </P>
    <P> ... ( it wont always hurt so much) ... pain will diminish over time in all cases ... </P>
    <P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="drawings/z_blueline.gif" WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="3"></P>
    <P>My <STRONG>personal</STRONG> <STRONG>opinion</STRONG>, is that sometimes we are discussing a  penis sprain, or a penis tendon inflammation, ..... (<FONT SIZE="2">let someone else express it better and we will learn more</FONT>) ......and like an ankle sprain or a tennis elbow, or a toothache, it simply cant be seen as distinctly clearly and  obviously - as an actual <I>fracture</I> -  it is difficult to diagnose - and also it cant be treated as <I>directly</I> - it is more subtle - ... </P>
    <P ALIGN="center"><IMG SRC="drawings/z_blueline.gif" WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="3"></P>
    <P> Accupuncture?<BR>
      Western Medicine has a tradition of ignoring male genitals - (the Chicago Hope hospital encyclopedia said the penis  is the least studied organ of the human body) (why? maybe the traditional <I>male</I> doctors are embarrassed and didnt want to be thought of as obsessed with the penis?).... I have a background respect for the life saving doctors, but with the penis they really dont know much, even the urologists dont learn about the penis<I> </I>- its the internal organs that they specialise with - simply I know this because Ive questioned several urologists who have agreed with this.
      
    <P> Traditional Chinese Medicine has a totally different attitude to sexual matters and the genitals. Read any traditional chinese sexual literature and you will see what I mean.
      
    <P>So the idea is someone with the money and energy,  please experiment with accupuncture.

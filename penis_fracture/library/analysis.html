      Perhaps it should be called a penis sprain or inflammation - this would not mean the problem is a small one. Bone fractures will cure in a matter of weeks, and yet tennis elbow and muscle strains can last painfully for years. It seems a fracture is easy to diagnose and it is also easy to cure. Fracture sounds dramatic, but is in fact a relatively uncomplicated problem.
      
    <P>(My Oxford dictionary defines sprain<STRONG>:</STRONG> wrench (an ankle, wrist etc.) violently so as to cause pain and swelling but not dislocation ... the resulting inflammation ...  )
      
    <P><B>From 2000</B><BR>
      Analysis - I havent got a clue - 
      
    <P>This page explores an apparently rare, sharp pain possibly caused by a trapped or ripped nerve. I know very little about this area, - I need to collect information. 
      
    <P>There appears to be no medical research on such pains and it seems urologists are often inclined to designate them as psychosomatic or give a false diagnosis of peyronnies previous to any examination.. - (This seems to follow the principle: if someones got unknown symptoms then diagnose an illness of unknown cause ! ). 
      
    <P>However, Peyronnies, isnt just one sided, it doesn`t occurr suddenly overnight, and it creates plaques (hard calcified areas under the skin) which can be detected by feeling or with ultra sound. (though Peyronnies has bending as symptom) 
      
    <P>Some doctors diagnose such problems as being due to a nerve trapped in the back or hip - this appears connected in some cases,- and this should be exactly diagnosed with MRI and then the causal area given electro treatment 
      
    <P>In one book I found my symptoms described as Atypical Penis Fracture. My complaint is generally not thought to be a penis fracture because the typical sign of bleeding was absent..Typical fractures always have some symptom of bruising bleeding or cracking ... I suspect there are many varieties of penis fracture, and I've found out that some men experience penis fracture a) with profuse bleeding, b) with a loud crack, but no bleeding, sometimes with pain and sometimes without c) with a loud crack and nothing else .... so I suspect all these symptoms must indicate specific causes ... 
      
    <P>The symptom of a sudden pain and subsequent bending of the erection away from the painful side is the main support we have for a diagnosis of penis fracture. 
      
    <P>Anaesthetic creams can relieve the pains (in my case) temporarily (and this might be worth a try in order to check a nerve diagnosis) - </P>
    <P> I suspect a nerve is trapped in all atypical cases, either a) traumatically or b) gradually, </P>
    <P>The gradual cases might indicate bad sitting posture etc. where a nerve becomes slowly trapped, some sort of electro treatment may well help, but it would be a haphazard trial and error method without a diagnosis, and it is impossible even with MRI to diagnose small rips in very small nerves.</P>
    <P>This was the extent of my knowledge on this up till 2004, - basicly I havent a clue -- These days there are more reports and further developments on the fracture forum</P>

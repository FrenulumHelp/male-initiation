<P>Thanks Joshua

<P>Good Luck. 

<P>And as I always say, please keep us updated.

<P>>Every doc I've seen has been a urologist, 4 of them in fact. None of which told me what i wanted to hear until I volunteered for that injection. The doc offered that injection to me to prove to me that it was working right..........low and behold..........he was wrong and I was right. I know the injeciton wasn't a doppler it was just a ED treatment to force an erection. After the doc saw that it didn't work he said his theory was a venous leak but He was going to send me to a different urologist that has handled this before.........so now I'm playing the waiting game while he does his research and calls me back........I sure hope they can just fix it in one surgery.....I don't want to have multiples and if I do in fact have a leak I'm gonna have a hard time believing they couldn't have fixed it the day I went to ER....because if its now unfixable because my body has already healed up on its own..............there will be a huge lawsuit................<br>>>Joshua<br>>>Again, thanks for keeping the forum informed; what you have to say is REALLY IMPORTANT! Was the guy that you saw today a urologist? If not, what was he?<br>>>The injection that you had today was called a doppler test or a rigiscan. Basically a rigiscan is some sort of drug that makes the penis become erect, or is at least meant to. If the penis gets hard then they claim that nothing is wrong with the blood supply and therefore the basis of the ED is psychological. Don't let them fob you off with this crap. I did get some kind of erection from this drug but it wasn't a full one; the urologist I saw still insisted on telling me that nothing was wrong.<br>>>A few months after I saw the first urologist, I saw a second one. When I showed him the results of my x-rays and scans, and the pressure measurements within the penis, he said that the pressure of blood was extermely low for a man of my age, health etc. He was very flipant about the whole thing and appeared to find my situation quite amusing. Needless to say I didn't go back to him.<br>>>You mentioned that the guy you saw thought you had a leak. Venous leak is not cureable yet, but if you had 'venous leak', then the doppler test should have picked this up.<br>>>I would encourage you to persue the lawsuit, you sound like a strong individual. I would be very interested to know who this doctor comes up with as a recommended specialist. Do you mind sharing with us what part of the states you live in? There is a guy at Cornell University Hospital (New York), but he seems to only be successfull with typical fractures, if they have been diagnosed within 4-5 days.  <br>>>The penis reconstruction route is not good, it typically involves a prosthesis and vacuum pump, - like I said - not good!<br>>>Maybe, you will uncover something positive, that my research missed. I hope so. But whatever you do please stay in touch.<br>>>Louis.<br>>>>Well today I had another doctor's visit. I went into this appointment with a chip on my shoulder since I'm now much more educated in the proper techniques to treat this type of injury. I really put him in the firing range and asked him about all the things the ER staff didn't do to me and why didn't they do more test before they sent me on my way. He said that since I hadn't done a residency in urology basically that my information didn't matter...and then when I said that I wasn't trying to be a jerk he told me I was....<br>>>>Pretty sure I ticked him off and then he didn't believe me about my erection troubles and tried to convince me that it was psychological. When I argued with him he told me that they had an injection they could give me that would give me a rigid erection and that it would prove that everything is working properly. I think he was bluffing so I told him to go ahead and do it......He paused a few minutes and then went and got the injection. He told me they were going to put the needle in my penis and inject some kind of medicine that should have me very erect in 5 minutes or so.<br>>>>So he did the injection and came back 5 minutes later.....saw the results (which were pathetic) and told me he would be back in another 5 minutes. Then he came back and it hadn't gotten any better. He told me that at my age, with the amount of medicine they had injected...I should have had a very firm erection but I didn't. FINALLY he believed me and started to actually listen to what I had to say. I think he even sensed that I was thinking about a lawsuit because he started to make excuses for the ER staff saying that they did the best they could with the info they had....and how I didn't have the typical symptons of this type of injury....as in I never had any bruising or swelling........to which I replied....thats because the blood came out my urethra instead of collecting in the skin of the penis. He said that may be the case and that there were in fact more test that can be done to find out what the problem is....which is what I was just telling him earlier in the appointment but he didn't want to listen to me. So now he told me he was going to make a few phonecalls and find someone that specializes in penis reconstruction and treatment for this particular injury. He did advise me that I may have to travel since it may be hard to find a person with the skill in the area that I need....he also admitted that he had little to no experience with this issue.......<br>>>>I'm getting a lawyer plane and simple. Its ridiculous to think I have to take a shot in the penis before this doctor was willing to even listen to what my ideas were onthe issue.  He now says that his theory is that I have a blood leak somewhere in the shaft and that its like a tire. If you have a good size leak...you can air it up all day and it will get air but never fill all the way up..........my question after that was then....where is the blood leaking too?? He didn't have an answer and gave me a number to call to order a cock ring....he wants me to try that but I don't think I'm going to..........I'm going to talk to a lawyer first as I'm rather displeased with this entire ordeal now. <br>>>>>Joshua,<br>>>>>Thanks for responding. The main differencwe between your injury and mine is that yours was obvious, mine wasn't. There are degrees of penis fracture and one urologist (the most pre-eminent urologist in the UK) told me he doesn't even believe that a fractured penis can happen!<br>>>>>I am now 41 and have lived with this condition for 3 years. It doesn't get any better and Cialis doesn't help much. When this happened to me I was at the top of my career. I gave up work, I couldn't function at all and I disappered down a black hole. Six months ago, I resumed working  again; I couldn't have done it without my girlfriend. It was with her that the accident happened. I didn't get any councelling, but I did get a chronic bout of depression and gained 50lb's. I cried for 2 years. I'm now getting married in 12 months and although life is anything but rosey, I just take one day at a time.<br>>>>>You may find a little bit of comfort in the work of Dr. Anthony Atala. Look him up on google. He<br>>>>>is a world leading tissue engineer. Soon he will be able to make a penis or correct defects in a penis, using one's own cells. Like I said 'read-up'. Before I go, can you tell us was your injury only urethral? Did you tear the tunica albuginea?, or dorsal vein? If you need any papers on the subject let me know.<br>>>>>I hope you and your wife get through this. Stay in touch with the forum and let us know how you're progressing.<br>>>>>Louis<br>>>>><br>>>>>>I couldn't see the tear as it was internal. The blood came out the tip of my penis through my urethra which should indicate a urethral injury. As I stated before, all the literature that I have read has stated that a urethral injury requires surgery to repair. I may have made a grammar error before. I in fact am seeking a lawyer as I feel like I was given a bandaid for a serious matter that requires surgery.<br>>>>>>My wife and I haven't had any counseling yet but I feel we are heading down that road. As time goes on and the lack of sex takes its toll....our relationship is ultimately suffering.<br>>>>>>To make this whole situation worse the last doctor I saw gave me viagra and told me it was a psychological problem and that the viagra should cure it, and if it didn't......I would probably just be stuck in this state for the duration of my life.<br>>>>>>That statement to me was like ripping out my heart. I'm only 28 years old and to be told that I can't have sex again for the rest of my life is ridiculous. Now I did try a couple times with my wife when I had the viagra.......however, it didn't help....my problem isn't that I can't get an erection....its that the erection isn't firm...not anywhere near the firmness it should be and I believe its actually more dangerous to attempt sex with a flimsy penis. As I stated we tried while I was on the viagra to just test the whole "Psychological" idea out....and in the process, It bent again and scared the crap out of me. You see, with a soft penis, trying to penetrate is a chore....and once you have succeeded....keeping it there is dangerous to say the least....on several occasions I would simply fall out, and on 2 occasions it came out about half way and upon trying to go back in, it bent and scared us both.....<br>>>>>>Well enough for now, <br>>>>>>I have another doctor visit tomorrow and I'll also be talking to a lawyer.<br>>>>>>Thanks again.<br>>>>>>>Joshua<br>>>>>>>Sorry to hear about your circumstances, but thank you for sharing it with us. The first thing I'd like to say is that none of us are doctors on this forum, at least not that I know of. Most of us have however, suffered some sort of penile injury which doctors do not seem to understand. Hence the term "atypical".<br>>>>>>>Listening to your story, it sounds like you had a very typical fracture and that there was no mistaking the fact that your situation was a medical emergency. Time and time again the literature clearly shows that this kind of trauma requires surgery. Any kind of conservative treatment would only encourage complications and eventual erectile dysfunction.<br>>>>>>>From what you describe: the blood pooring out, and the popping sound etc; there was an obvious wound/tear? Can you tell us if there were any kind of suture? Surely, you yourself saw the tear? I cannot comprehend that there were no stitches. Then again, from my experiences, urologists are not well versed in the workings of the penis,(ironically). In your letter, you say that you are not looking for a lawyer to persue a neglegence lawsuit. I do hope that this is a grammatical error, especially as you go on to say that the first urologist didn't appear to know what he was doing!<br>>>>>>>Had you had surgery,(which it doesn't appear that you have), then I would say that it was still a bit soon to expect that you'd be back up to full speed, sexually. I think it's about a good 4 months abstinance from sex that the doctors typically recommend.<br>>>>>>>How are you and your wife coping psychologically? Please keep us updated.<br>>>>>>>Louis<br>>>>>>> <br>>>>>>>> I suffered a penile fracture on 11/11/06. I was having sex with my wife and I was about to ejaculate. However, when I was about to pull my penis out, I heard a popping sound and begin to shoot blood out of the end of my penis. I had my wife call 911 while I stood in the bath tub and blood continued to drain from my penis. I would say it was consistant with a cut to the artery. The blood was pulsing out as if connected to my heart beat. With the blood loss, my penis deflated like a balloon that had been popped. I wrapped a towel around it and waited on the ambulance to take me to the hospital. The paramedic said I lost over a liter of blood and that would explain while I was light headed and felt like I was going to pass out.<br>>>>>>>>Upon arrival to the emergency room I was asked what was wrong. At this point my bleeding almost stopped, I believe its because the erection was gone which sealed up the wound just like a tire would leak if it had a nail in it...until the tire self sealed. I was asked to urinate for them which I painfully did and I was then taken to the xray room. At this point the doctor inserted a tube into my urethra and injected some kind of dye. This was extremely painful. He then did it again.....afterwards I was sent back to my room. I waited an additional 30 minutes or so and was told that I didn't need surgery and that they were going to give me a catheter and send me on my way.<br>>>>>>>>So the next day I'm sent to see a specialist (urologist) and he looks at my penis and says to keep the catheter in for a few more days.....On day 5 I see another urologist who then removes the catheter. Everything is good to go.......or so I thought. After another 4 weeks which I'm told to not have sex........I wait and wait....then on week 5, I try to have sex with my wife....but my penis will not become erect...not the way it should. Not enough to safely have sex with my wife. I go back to the the urology building and see another doctor. He advises me that its psychological and that they are going to give me viagra to try and get over the hurdle. So I take the viagra and attempt to have sex with my wife.......again its not erect like it should be and it bends and almost, in my mind, breaks again as it bent pretty severely due to the fact that it wasn't erect like it should be. <br>>>>>>>>I go back to the doctor and he says stop taking the pills........and thats it.....<br>>>>>>>>I'm left hanging. <br>>>>>>>>I have done extensive amounts of researching online about this penile fracture. Almost every single paper I reade states that blood in the urine or urethra indicates a urethra injury that requires surgery..........and that if surgery isn't done there can be complications such as ED.<br>>>>>>>>My question is........why didn't the ER doc or the first urologist or any urologist for that matter....why didn't they mention surgery to me as an option. I would think losing a liter of blood through the urethra would indicate a significant tear that would warrant surgery....I'm not contemplating getting a lawyer as I believe the urologist that first saw me was unfit to do his job and has caused me alot more pain than needed to be....<br>>>>>>>>Could you please offer any advice......<CENTER><P><HR></p></CENTER><input type=hidden name="followup" value="264,265,266,267,268,269,270,271"><input type=hidden name="origname" value="Louis"><input type=hidden name="origemail" value="louis2529-at-btinternt.com"><input type=hidden name="origsubject" value="Re: Penile Fracture Question"><input type=hidden name="origdate" value="31 Jan 2007 22:27:14"><input type=hidden name="subject" value="Re: Penile Fracture Question"><br><CENTER>

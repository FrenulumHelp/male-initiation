<P>As an answer to: <a href="282.htm">Penile Fracture</a> written by Bambino1977 at 31 Mar 2007 05:26:04:

<P>Sorry to hear of your plight. I'm glad you found this website, although I appreciate you probably wish you never had to look for such information. The website was set up by a guy called Robin Stuart and the praise for starting the website needs to go to him. I was exactly where you are, three years ago and I remember the releif I felt when I stumbled across this site.

<P>I am not a physician, and its unlikely that anyone who responds to you will have any medical qualifications. What we do have in common is the problem of an atypical penile fracture and the subsequent life changing effects that are associated with it. As you are probably finding out the medical world is not very educated or skilled with regards to this type of injury and much of the time we end up going around in circles, not really getting anywhere. I am fortunate enough to have a very understanding partner and we are soon to be married. Having said that, life is increadibly difficult and everyday is a new hurdle. For me it never gets easier.

<P>Having gone through the worst, my personal opinion is that this is not a psychological problem, especially as you say that your fracture has been confirmed by the medical profession. However, this doesn't mean that you are not being affected psychologically. What has happened to you has an enormous effect on a man's view of himself.

<P>You say "Ive read many websites, most of which give very positive results", I think these websites are referring to typical (not atypical) penile fractures. With a typical fracture there is an obvious break, blood leaks profusely through the organ and is very visible under the skin. In these type of cases, ironically there is a good chance of recovery without complications, if it is caught in time. 

<P>You say it would be good to share other peoples experiences, I don't have a problem with that, there are many stories on this website with other mens experiences. If you want to talk to someone I'm happy to talk, you can contact me on the email details above and we can arrange it, or we can continue conversing through this website, that way other people can take part in the conversation. Whichever way suits you right now, I'll be happy to help.

<P>Regards Louis

<P>>At last I've found a website with people to talk to about this condition.<br>>I suffered a penile fracture about 6 weeks ago, I just awoke one morning in an erect state and just put firm grip around it like I have every morning since I hit puberty and head a cracking sound.<br>>I woke my girlfriend, as it started to look very strange and I lost my erection, we went staright to the hospital (wondering if we were just being silly) where I saw the A&E doctor, then a surgeon then the consultant.  They wasn't sure if I had suffered a fracture as I had no pain, which isn't normal.<br>>I was taken into theatre within 2 hours, where they discovered it was a definate fracture.<br>>My issue is, that I was kept in hospital fro a couple of days and told to go home and rest for at least a week, and not to attemp sexual activity for 2 weeks.<br>>I did exactly as i was told, but here we are 6 weeks later, still unable to engage in any sexual activity.<br>>My girlfriend and I are both only 30 this yearm, and before my accident was trying for a baby.<br>>Our relationship is obviously getting affected as we are both deeplt worried that we will never be able to have sex again, which was something that was quite important to us both in out relationship.<br>>I was given very little information from the consultant apart from wait 2 weeks, Ive read many websites, most of which give very positive results, but none give any rough time scale on how long it will be before things are looking up (excuse the pun!)<br>>I am able to get an erection, it just does not become firm enough to engage in intercourse.<br>>We do both wonder if some of it may be physcolgical, as we are both very scared of it happening again, something else that the doctor never told us, is it now weaker than before and at risk of breaking again very easily.<br>>I would really appreciate for someone to share their experiences, it would just be nice to be able to talk to other people who are in the same position, as its something that isn't very common its very difficult people understanding what both my girlfriend and I are going through mentally.<br>>We are trying to remain positive, but there are many days where that is extremley difficult for both of us<CENTER><P><HR></p></CENTER><input type=hidden name="followup" value="282,283"><input type=hidden name="origname" value="Louis"><input type=hidden name="origemail" value="loius-at-btinternet.com"><input type=hidden name="origsubject" value="Re: Penile Fracture"><input type=hidden name="origdate" value="04 Apr 2007 12:39:56"><input type=hidden name="subject" value="Re: Penile Fracture"><br><CENTER>

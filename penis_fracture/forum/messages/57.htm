<P>I'm a 26 year old healthy male. In May of 2004, I experienced a serious beating, where I might have suffered from some kind of trauma to the pelvic region. As a result, a few days afterwards, I experienced a strange string like vein (very hard during erection) on my penis, which lasted for a few weeks. Subsequently, I started having problems achieving an erection. I waited a long time for it to pass by itself - this is what doctors told me to do. In the following months, I could almost not get any kind of erection. In December, I went to a so-called specialist, where it was quickly diagnosed as Peronie's disease. I was satisfied with that diagnosis and I was told that it could take up to 18 months to subside. I have been waiting patiently, and this month I went for a second opinion, as I still have many problems getting and maintaining an erection. I'm outstationed, so this was a different doctor. Judging from my story, he was sure that I had a venus leak, which of course has made me terrified. 

<P>I would say that my typical erection on a good day is something like 75% of what I used to get and after a few seconds of non-stimulation, it falls down quickly. Some days, I can only get a 50% erection, which is unusable. I have tried Viagra, which works for me, but it is just un-natural, especially considering that I'm still only 26.

<P>I don't know what to do about this, and I would like to have your professional view on my problem. Some say it's Peronie's, others say it's a venus leak. I myself believe that it was caused by trauma because of that very visible sign with the hard stringy vein, I had after the incident. Depending on your views on this, what are my options. How can you rule out certain types of erectile dysfunction? I would like to find out 100% what is causing my impotency, so what kinds of tests/exrays/ultra sound tests do I need to go through? My chest has increased over the last year, so I'm also thinking about a hormonal problem, but still I'm leaning towards the possibility of trauma.

<P>I'm looking very much forward to your kind help.

<P>Thanks & best regards.<BR><BR><CENTER>

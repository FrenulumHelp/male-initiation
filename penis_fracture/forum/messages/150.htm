<P>Hey Stevo,

<P>Ok read your answer, good luck with the specialist ... I had a practical new thought over the week which may be worth you thinking about and asking for if the specialist has no ideas ...

<P>Maybe ist the World cup, and different players who cant play due to sprains and strains and then I remembered someone telling me how similar what I described was, to sportsmen with torn nerves or ligaments ...

<P>I call it atypical penis fracture, because it seems to me this is as close as our injury is named anywhere, but its maybe more like a sprain or a torn ligament (how does a torn ligament feel?) 

<P>Its the idea that a Sports Doctor, a Doctor who specialises in Sports Injuries, is the specialist sort of doctor who would be able to understand many of our mysterious problems. I believe this means an Orthopedic doctor.

<P>Next step: persuading a doctor that this is a sport injury, and that in this sense sex is sport : I notice how many of the questions are connected with men saying they overdid it, had a bigger than normal erection, and then a stoss a hit or a bend or a strange movement ...

<P>Its pretty clear that Urologists dont understand these sort of problems. Its not only my experience. Enough of us (on this forum and home page) have been to Urologists. In my opinion, my next thought and the next step for someone asking at this forum is try a Sports Doctor.

<P>cheers

<P>Robin

<P>ü>I'm an american. California. UCLA is a big university here. My penis pain isn't great. It hurts a lot, but just like if i pinched you all the time. I can deal with the pain, if it were in my elbow i wouldn't give a damn about it ('cause it doesn't hurt that bad). <BR>>I'm not interested in being a provider, i just want to make love to the young girl that i love the way that a young man should be able to.<BR>>maybe they can fix me, i hope so. i have to wait 2 more weeks.<CENTER><P><HR></p></CENTER><BR><!-- AnfangLinie --><!-- EndeLinie -->

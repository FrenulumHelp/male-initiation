<P>>ANSWER TO FRACTURE/TRAUMA xxxletters<BR>Following through this theory that practically every man has experienced some sort of one sided nerve pain

<P>Talking with someone last night, He remembered a dauer erection (translation? something like) permanent erection where he had this one sided nerve pain from ball to hip. When he came - the pain went.

<P>Also one ball is always bigger than the other, his and my painful side was where the big one is - please confirm or deny this from your own experience.

<P>Its only through talking with people that I started this site and got my first information, I must have talked with over a hundred men before internet ever started (in Europe). I talked with everyone I knew. This is probably the reason I now have only about 3 friends! If I hadnt talked Id have lost them anyway, what good are friends if you cant talk with them.

<P>Please talk with your friends and find answers. Please be brave enough to tell the truth and ask for it.

<P>Maybe my last word at present, is if your anatomical equipment is now a pathetic example of being a man, please dont let your head be.

<P>Men must be more open. You are probably in the situation where no one can help you - I believe you have no choice but to talk openly, - DO IT like a MAN.

<P>Perhaps Im asking too much - too unrealistic, anyway thats my feeling

<P>Hello Jason,

<P>This sounds like a really bad dream. I suggest going straight away to a doctor, and try to give your penis time to heal in that you lay off playing with yourself for a while.

<P>I am not an expert on this subject, (I wish I could find one) ... but how could this happen overnight without you noticing anything?? - the 30-45 degree bend is more extreme than most penis fractures, and I have litle idea what the sudden hardening might be ... if it is a vein then it could be a form of atypical penis fracture, maybe its a blood clot and merely produces similar symptoms. 

<P>Usually with penis fracture if the pain is on the left side, the penis will bend to the right, so again, this makes me unsure of any diagnosis. Is there still a lot of pain? ... please go to a doctor. 

<P>I always try to remember that keeping cool is the most important thing - a nervous breakdown is worse than a penis break.  

<P>Sorry it takes so long to reply but Im only online every Wednesday.

<P>keep in touch good luck and please tell us how it develops.

<P>Robin

<P><BR>>Hello all,  I am looking for someone who might have an idea of what this is or what the heck is going on.  I am not sure what happened, but overnight the tip of my dick is bent toward the left in about a 30/45 degree angle and the shaft has, what feels like a hard vein or something running up the left side. I can still function sexually.  There is a lot of pain though.  Does someone what the heck happened or will this heal?  <CENTER><P><HR></p></CENTER><BR><!-- AnfangLinie --><!-- EndeLinie -->

<P>"I have studied this problem for three years now. The thing that makes this forum stand out for me is that it is supposed to be dedicated to men who feel they have had an atypical penile fracture and are experiencing ED because of this. No one else will listen to them and urologists keep on telling them that nothing is wrong, the problem is psychological or at best they diagnose peyronnies desease."

<P><br>Years ago the common cry was that erection problems are almost always psychological. That they were in your head, then the magic pills came out, that can help most sufferers, and the urologists changed their tunes, saving that "all in your head" status for those of us who the pills couldn't really help.

<P>My experience indicates to me that little could be done for a man with ED before Viagra, with the terrifying exception of an implant. and that if you have  a venous leak (as many of us who've suffered an injury now do, there's nothign that can be done (short of the implant).

<P>It's a bundle of nerves and blood vessels, that has a very high demand placed on it, from the perspective of a now imperfect and injured body part. It swings around, and bounces all day in your pants, and shrinks and grows all day (how's it ever supposed to heal?) and then when you become aroused it's supposed to have the fortitude to take enough liquid pressure inside to become solid.

<P>i'm 23, and after the 2nd time I had sex, I never had a full erection again, it's been 2 and a half years, things have only gotten worse.

<P>i realize that this post turned from my evaluation of our medical options, to me crying about my own specific plight, forgive me.

<P>As an answer to: <A HREF="244.htm">atypical fracture - numbness</A> written by m at 07 Dec 2006 18:48:48:

<P>Hello m,

<P>I have long considered what to do here - yes I would prefer you to post on the forum, because its just extra<BR>work for me and I am really getting exhausted ... with no support ...

<P>To send your email to Toc is encouraging private email exchange and<BR>this is totally useless for me and "us" (the entire forum group) -<BR>(wherever that may be) ... it feels like energy leaking out of me and<BR>the forum group - maybe if someone else would be helping answer forum<BR>letters then it would be OK sometimes for people to write personally,<BR>but at present, I cant support this without draining myself.

<P>I will send "Toc" an email saying you wanted to contact him and with a<BR>copy of your letter, asking him to come to the forum.

<P>I too am English living in Hamburg - come from Birmingham -

<P>now my main complaint is that you<BR>dont tell me/us how it was caused, ... were you overdoing it??? or did<BR>it just occur ... how did the pain occur???? any ideas???

<P>The bending symptom is the final symptom which somehow puts you in<BR>the same place as me/us

<P>yours is a good letter in many ways ... yes I feel it must be the<BR>nerves, maybe the pain is being self anaesthetised by your body and<BR>now causing numbness. ... (There is another letter on numbness about 6 down <BR>from this one - have you talked with him??)

<P>The doctors are aware of the normal typical fracture - this is<BR>spectacular - our problem isnt ...

<P>I know about the health system in England ... but feel its still one<BR>of the best when considering the whole world ... and it seems nowhere<BR>in the world have the doctors started examining our type of maybe very<BR>rare problem ... its no good getting frustrated about this ... please<BR>imagine ten years back pre internet .. any guy with this sort of<BR>complaint would be completely alone - (I was for the first few years)-<BR>and it really is not worth any doctor researching this as an individual complaint -<BR>I can fully understand the practical doctor ... I can fully appreciate<BR>him just saying its psychosomatic and the poor guy probably going<BR>crazy thinking perhaps it is.

<P>I feel the forum and our collective need is our only hope (or<BR>certainly our main hope) of getting this problem recognised, and<BR>researched.

<P>If you disagree, then please tell me what other alternative we have apart from as a group??!!

<P>I wish others on the forum would come back and participate and try, as<BR>I am, writing to any online urologist asking them to look at the forum<BR>- its no use asking them to look at just me - they are practical<BR>people

<P>infact it makes me angry that others with our complaint dont come<BR>back and participate.

<P>>it seems to<BR>> me now that men with these problems are fighting against the<BR>> ignorance of the majority of the medical world

<P>I feel Im fighting against the selfishness (selfishness isnt just arrogance its also self pity etc.) or stupidity(?) of the men who have our problem - everyone seems to want to go it alone or just give up ... and thats going to result in the same results that it has done for the last 1000 years : nothing

<P>the medical world cant be blamed on this subject - they have to think<BR>practically - our problem occurs perhaps one in 10,000 - any individual<BR>doctor probably sees only one case in his life - how can we expect<BR>them to spend 5000 (?) quid for every MRI when they dont even know what<BR>they are looking for!!

<P>So please, you sound like a sensible guy - think practically about<BR>this - I enclose my regular footnote - (in fact your letter and writing<BR>this has encouraged me to edit and update it) ... (thanks)

<P>So many of "us" have been to countless urologists for countless tests<BR>- and somehow we and the doctors are not getting results - so what are<BR>WE doing wrong that we could do better -

<P>please think how a group can change a situation which individually we<BR>will never change.

<P>cheers

<P>Robin

<P>I include my normal footnote<BR>_______________________________________<BR>One optimistic thought is that at least we can contact each other these days with www.<BR>I often wonder how it was even 20 yrs. ago, left totally alone with this problem, - I think Id have gone crazy without www. Men with our problems must have been going crazy throughout the last centuries.

<P>Isolated and individual we will be as lost as the men pre interet - the chance we have today is as a group.

<P>This forum and home page are becoming a collection of evidence on penis trauma/atypical fracture. I feel our collective need is our only hope (or certainly our main hope) of getting this problem recognised, and researched.

<P>I wish others on the forum would come back and participate, everyone seems to want to go it alone or just give up ... and thats going to result in the same results that it has done for the last 1000 years : nothing.

<P>its no use asking doctors to look at just “me” - the medical world cant be blamed on this subject - they have to think practically - our problem occurs perhaps one in 5,000 - any individual doctor probably sees only one case in his life -

<P>So many of "us" have been to countless urologists for countless tests - and somehow we and the doctors are not getting results - so what are WE doing wrong that we could do better -

<P>please think how a group can change a situation which individually we will never change.

<P>Please contribute to this forum and talk with each other - dont just expect me to answer.

<P>If you disagree TELL ME WHAT OTHER ALTERNATIVE WE HAVE APART FROM A<BR>GROUP??!!

<P>I feel what we need is a student Urologist to answer letters on the forum. Students have time to research, and a last year student doing a special research on this subject would be ideal - they are always looking for new subjects to write diploma work.

<P>Im NOT online at home - I dont have the possibility to do internet research.<BR>Please leave links and comments on other www addresses<BR>which deal with these subjects - so that an index or network of<BR>relevant pages can be developed. (Someone recently left a link which<BR>enabled me to write to an online urology faculty asking if anyone can<BR>help)

<P>Id love someone to spend a couple of hours using their “worry” energy positively to google for medical universities (esp. Urology dept.) and collect 50 or even 10 e mail addresses, ... and then send out spam like invitations to help ...

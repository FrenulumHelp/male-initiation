<P>I spoke with my doctor on the phone yesterday. He told me that he is not surprised that sex relieved my pain, and that a lack of sex welcomed it back. So the fact is, i can cure a lot of my pain if i start using my penis again, frequently.

<P>But it isn't that simple.

<P><BR>Unfortunately something happened while my girl was here. I observered a number of times that after we'd have sex, when my penis was in the "deflating" phase, it would curve to the left. 90 degrees, literally like a snake, the head pointing straight left.

<P>and that means that the spot where my dick hurts, does have a damage problem. 

<P>It's become clear that the majority of my pain is from prostatitis, but the fact is i have damage.

<P><BR>I find myself in a bind.

<P><BR>Do i use my dick, frequently so that i can relieve my pain, although i'll likely be aggravating this damage (or at least not letting it heal).   or do i endure the pain, for a month or two, so that my damage can hopefully heal?

<P>I wanted to ask my doctor about that part too, but he was strapped for time.

<P>I still don't know what i'll do.

<P><BR>i don't know if your situation is similar to mine man. But perhaps you have chronic prostatitis causing you pain.

<P>truthfully this was the 3rd doctor to give me a prostate exam, and he was the first to diagnose me with it.  he was......significanly more.....aggressive in the process (hurt a bit) and he found it where they didn't......so.....fuck an a.

<P>maybe look into it man. maybe you, like me, have more than one problem, one of which is prostatitis.<BR><BR><CENTER>

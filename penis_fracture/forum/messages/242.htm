<P>Hi s,

<P>For me the point is you heard a popping sound which is one of the indications for penis fracture .. and there is some change in sensation ... however I have no analysis, I dont understand what might have happened ... did you accidently bend or knock your erection?

<P>my (inexpert and unprofessional) suggestion is a few days abstinence and then if you feel normal sensation then try again and come back and tell us how it feels.

<P>cheers

<P>>when i was masturbating, i heard a popping sound, no real pain followed, no bleeding, i was still hard and i still finished.  However afterwards, i have this weird sensation around the pelvic area of my penis, not pain.<br>><br>>i masterbated again after about 4 hrs and everything was fine, however im not sure what is wrong as there is still discomfort.<br>>could this be a mild sprain/fracture? or am i just being paranoid?<br>>thanks for all for reading<br>>s<CENTER><P><HR></p></CENTER><input type=hidden name="followup" value="235,242"><input type=hidden name="origname" value="Robin"><input type=hidden name="origsubject" value="Re: Paranoid ?"><input type=hidden name="origdate" value="07 Dec 2006 18:44:27"><input type=hidden name="subject" value="Re: Paranoid ?"><br><CENTER>

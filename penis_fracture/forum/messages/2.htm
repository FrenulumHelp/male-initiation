<P>Penile Injury

<P> About 22 months ago I was accidently bitten by a<BR>ignorant Female about 1 1/2 inches from the tip of<BR>the Penis which created chronic Pain. I take<BR>Neurontin, 600 mg per day, which does help. I am<BR>in search of medical help or direction in solving<BR>my problem. My Urologist and a Pain Specialist<BR>told me it could be months to years , or who<BR>knows, before I may heal. I notice a warm feeling<BR>when my Penis touches my leg. I am told that this<BR>is the Nerve endings misfiring Being a 55 year old<BR>male in good health, I had a great sex life belore<BR>my accident. Life was great even, if I worked 55<BR>hours per week. Now I have to take lots of<BR>Anti-inflamatories, to keep the pain down to work<BR>a stressful job to keep the $ coming. Living in<BR>Memphis, TN. USA, there are no Specialists here<BR>who have experience in Penile Bites,etc. I am told<BR>that Stem Cell,etc may help in the healing<BR>process. I would be in your debt forever if you<BR>had any ideas, direction, or help for me. I would<BR>even buy your time and expertise. I know that<BR>there are many other men out there like me who<BR>have "No Direction" and eventually give up.<BR>Sincerely,

<P>xm<BR><BR><CENTER>

<P>Dr Stuart,

<P>I have a big problem and request your help and guidance. For the past 1 month, I am unable to get an erection and have been experiencing a lot of pain around the base of my penis. Looks like there is a muscle tear or sprain and feels as if the muscle is weak to support the enlargement.

<P>I have had this problem on and off since Oct of 2004 but over the last few months of 2005, I thought the problem was over. During December 2005, my family had viral fevers but I probably got a mild attack with just body and muscular pain. Since then I have not been able to have an erection but I do get my morning erections during sleep.

<P>I fear that the muscular tear or sprain has not healed and keeps showing up now and then disturbing my married life. This causes me a lot of grief and tension.

<P>Please help.

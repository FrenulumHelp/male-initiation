<P>Hello,

<P>6 months ago is when my problem started. I hadn't masturbated in a few days so I had a large erection. I masturbated, ejaculated and, before I lost the erection, I masturbated and ejaculated again. There was no loud snap or bleeding/discolouration but I felt like I had overdone it, it wasn't particularly sore, just had a little discomfort.

<P>Since then my penis curves to the left, very difficult to get erections without touching myself. I use Cialis for intercourse, but I've felt this is not working as good as it used to...is the normal?

<P>I've had a number of tests. Blood tests, ultrasound of penis while erect, MRI of abdomen, not penis. Blood test ruled out diabetes, ultrasound ruled out venous leak and MRI ruled out spinal cord injury. I haven't had an MRI of the penis yet, I'll need to travel to another country for that.

<P>Urologist cannot figure out what's wrong<BR>Does this sound like atypical penile fracture?<BR>Is it likely to get worse over time?<BR>Is abstinence advisable? I haven't tried that yet<BR>Is surgery available?<BR>How successful is it?

<P>Thanks for your help,<BR>Joe<BR><BR><CENTER><HR></p></CENTER><!-- EndeLinie -->

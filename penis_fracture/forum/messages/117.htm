<P>Hi Steve,

<P>Thanks for your light hearted letter (better than crying) and full description of medical history.

<P>Im afraid Ive not got much good news - let me tell you my ideas without thinking too much about the order.

<P>First most of the men on this forum have erection problems and curvature and some sort of fracture, but few have any pain ... maybe at a guess about a quarter who write here are in any sort of pain.

<P>I am one of them - I had an injury 12 yrs. ago - the first 6 months were always very painful, nowadays, it is mainly a very tender painful right ball ... and the joint of the bone on the inside of the right leg where this connects to the pubic bone is painful when walking - by masturbation  there is always some sort of pain - quite deep back behind the pubic bone. I was with around 15 urologists none of whom understood the problem. - If you wanna read the full symtoms they are on the home page of this forum under "Rob. S site owner"

<P>When pain is present, as it is in our cases, I believe it must be a nerve which is ripped or torn or strained. As I understand it ripped nerves do not repair. If it is only strained then maybe 6 weeks abstinence could help.

<P>There is a very small success rate on this forum, I believe only 2 men with minor (non-painful) fractures have rested 6 weeks and recovered with only a shock.

<P>So maybe this is the wrong place to write if you want to get better!!

<P>22 is a hard age to get this sort of problem ... Im 53 now, - for the last six months I have hardly masturbated (honest!) ... sexual energy just seems to have gone to sleep - which actually makes the problem easier for me ... at the age of 22 thats gonna be tricky - I wish you every luck and strength to cope with this.

<P>There is a litle footnote which I have started pasting on every letter, which I feel applies to you as well. I believe the only way to cure our problem is with a real urological specialist who is willing to consider the problem - it seems a very uncommon problem - the regular urologist gets one such question every life ... What I want is a urologist to look at the sort of problems on this board and think creatively about the problem ... 

<P>the footnote goes like this 

<P>________________________________________

<P>One optimistic thought is that at least we can contact each other these days with www. I often wonder how it was even 20 yrs. ago, my God to be left feeling totally alone with this problem, and then questioning myself on if Im imagining it all - I think Id have gone crazy. And men with our problem must have been going crazy throughout the last<BR>centuries. I am very thankful to www 

<P>------------------------------

<P>I feel we need an index of all the penis fracture sites and erectile dysfunction - impotence resources etc. online. But, Im NOT online at home - I dont have the possibility to do internet research - Please leave links and comments on other www addresses which deal with these subjects - so that an index or network of relevant "impotence - erectile dysfunction" pages can be developed.

<P>Actually I feel what we need is a student Urologist to answer letters on the forum. Students have time to research, and a last year student doing a special research on this subject would be ideal - they are always looking for new subjects to write diploma work.

<P>Id love someone to spend a couple of hours using their "worry" energy positively to google for medical universities (esp. Urology dept.) and collect 50 or even 20 e mail addresses, and post the addresses on the forum, ... and then I can send out spam like invitations to help the research ... <BR>________________________________________

<P>Steve, I must say that I think in your case, 3 months after the injury (or 17 months depending on how we calculate) I believe practicing abstinence will not help - (if you want to try then check entry number 36.htm on this forum where I gave some ideas on how the hell to forget sex for a few weeks).

<P>I think as well if you have the money you should try an accupuncturist ... accupuncture can cure toothache, so I reckon it must be able to cure this, but again you need a really good accupuncturist who is willing to think creatively because this is simply not what they handle with every day. 

<P>So Steve these are my spontaneous thoughts - I hope you keep in touch - I wish you every luck - Im here once a week to answer questions - keep the sense of humour alive -<BR>take care

<P>cheers

<P>>>So about 17 months ago i had intercourse, lasting about 3 hours, I failed to climax then went soft.<BR>>>That's kind of where my problems started.<BR>>>After that there were a few ocassions where my girlfriend moved uncoordinatedly and hurt my dick. Ever since then I either come very quickly, or lose my erection during sex, and i don't get as big or as hard. So I've had this problem for a while, so two docotr's both of whom reccomended 6 weeks rest. Which I failed utterly to do.<BR>>>My erection angle lowered a bit too<BR>>>so the problem stayed as it was.<BR>>><BR>>>But then about 3 months ago, i fell asleep wearing rather tight pants and had a sex dream. I woke up and my dick hurt quite a lot. So now my dick hurts all the time. I'm finally giving it rest (have been for about 3 days) but the truth is, it hurts just from living and moving, and standing and walking, and having my pants touch it.<BR>>>I feel like...how is it supposed to heal when it's flacid and moving and wiggling all the time?<BR>>>I mean it just hurts! I saw a urologist and he told me to rest it, so that's what i'm doing (finally) but god, if i can't stand up from my desk and walk to the front door without it hurting, how can it heal?<BR>>><BR>>>has anyone on these forums ever had a problem like this that got better?<BR>>I'm 22 btw. it happened when i was 21<CENTER><P><HR></p></CENTER><BR><!-- AnfangLinie --><!-- EndeLinie -->

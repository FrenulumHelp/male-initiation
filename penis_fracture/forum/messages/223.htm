<P>About two years ago I believed I suffered a minor penis fracture. <BR>During sex, my girlfriend was on top, I heard/felt a pop in my penis.<BR>I experienced no pain, no bruising (that I noticed), but I did experience a change in erections.<BR>Though not bad at first; Incidences of losing erections happened a few times.

<P>Well, a few months later her and I broke up. I entered into a new relationship with a woman who wanted to be a virgin until marriage. Instead of intercourse, we had oral sex. I noticed no problems, because , I suppose, one doesn't need a seriously rigid erection for oral sex.

<P>Her and I broke up. This is when I noticed my problem. I have experienced loss of erections and when I do get them, they're relatively weak, compared to the ones I had way back. This was quite a problem for me. 

<P>I went to my doctor. He gave me cialis and I got my rigid erections back. I'm happy that it works, but I don't want to rely on medication. I want to fix this. I'm only twenty years old. 

<P>Is surgery even an option for me now? Or is it too late?<BR>Will I have to rely on pills for the rest of my life?

<P>PS<BR>Here are a few websites that I have found. I don't know if it's old news or not.<BR>http://www.malereproduction.com/<BR>http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic3415.htm<BR><BR><CENTER>

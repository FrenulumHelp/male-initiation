<P>I thought that I would write an update - it may help others in a similar situation feel better.   I finally got up courage to visit a doctor and explain what had happened.   Firstly he examined me and was immediately able to say that he was sure that I had not fractured my penis - that was already a relief to hear.   I was still having discomfort and the desire to urinate very frequently.  He carried out a bunch of blood and urine tests and found that there was no infection.  He told me that the trauma can last several weeks and it was the irritation from that causing the urinary urgency.  He prescribed some herbal pills "dragees pour la vessie" in French.  These seem to have helped reduce the irritation and now about 4 weeks after the injury - I feel almost back to normal.

<P>I think that I was very lucky and will be very careful to avoid such an injury in future.  A close call!

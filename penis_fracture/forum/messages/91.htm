<P>Hi. I'm a 20 year old, circumcised virgin male that has had no problems with my penis until recently. It seems that a few weeks ago (in the middle of January), I had done some damage to my glans. <BR><BR>I was taking a shower and was washing my penis (which was hard), but during that time, I accidently squeezed the underside of the neck of my glans (where the head and shaft meet, and right behind the urethral opening) a little too hard and caused a little pain. When I finished the shower and went to urinate, I felt a burning sensation upon peeing in the spot where I pinched the glans (and my urethral opening), along with some mild (enough to be noticiable), but nearly constant pain (I feel it like every 15 seconds or so) in that spot. I felt the burning sensation whenever I urinated for a few days, but the mild pain in the spot didn't.<BR><BR>Since then, I've been feeling the mild, nearly constant pain in that area, and I've felt it when my penis is both flaccid and erect (it lessens when I'm erect). It's been waking me up at times (5 or 6 in the morning), but it seems to lessen while I'm urinating (meaning ithe pain's milder and not as uncomfortable), but goes back to its mild, nearly constant state afterwards. I also notice that ejaculating causes the pain to worsen in that area for a little while (The worse I had was slight burning for a little over an hour.), and decided to abstain from ejaculating for a while. The last time I ejaculated was Saturday, Febuary 4. <BR><BR>At first, I thought this would simply was a mild ureathral injury and would heal over in a week or so, but when it didn't, I've been trying to heal it myself while looking up the net for info. In my search, I found out about the corpus spongisum and read that it's the spongy tissue that surrounds the ureathra and makes up the glans of the penis, along with the penis being more vulnerable to injury when erect and that ejaculation causes slight trauma to my urethra (thereby possibly worsening my injury). I'm now worried that I may have not only injured the urethral area right behind my ureathral opening (and within the glans) but also damaged the spongy tissue surrounding it due to me squeezing it a little too hard in its erect state. I'm also worried that I may have damaged the nerves, even though the only problem I'm experiancing is the pain.<BR><BR>I've tried healing my injury by taking warm baths (which seems to lessen the pain), drinking a lot so I could urinate a lot (just to dilute the urine to prevent it from irritating the ureathral opening), and as of yesterday started taking vitamin E (read it promotes healing in damaged tissues). I've been also giving myself erections, and not for pleasure (I'm purposely keeping myself erect for like 2 or 3 minutes), but for healing since I've read that a frequent, spontanuous erection pumps fresh blood into the spongy tissues, making healing faster. I haven't ejaculated or put myself close to ejaculation during these erections since I don't want to cause any more trauma to the injured area.<BR><BR>It's been over three weeks since I started feeling the pain (one week since I last ejaculated) and would like to know what's your opinion on the injury and what it is (damage to ureathra, spongy tissues that surround the ureatra, or both.). I do know it's not a urethral infection because I experianced no discharge nor signs of infection (I went to have my urine checked 2 weeks ago, and it came out clean) so that is out of the question. I would also like to know your opinion on how should I heal the injury. Should I keep giving myself erections just to pump fresh blood into the spongy tissues just so it could heal faster, and I should I keep taking vitamin E to promote healing?

<P>I would also like to know what are your opinions on what kind of injury is this? Is it trauma to urethra/penile dorsalnerves/corpus spomsgium, or is it a combonation? Like I said, it ain't an infection.  <BR><CENTER><P><HR></p></CENTER><BR><!-- AnfangLinie --><!-- EndeLinie -->

<P>Unfortunately nothing seems to have come from 2 weeks of those therapies twice a day.

<P><br>I believe the stronger nocturnal erection was just a result of the dialy cialis, coupled with a few days of no sex or masturbation.

<P>My pain has not improved, and my function has not improved. I'm just trying to keep moving. It's difficult to do. I'm miserable, I haven't tried to kill myself again, and right now I don't want to, but the truth is every day when I wake up i wish i hadn't. I don't want to live this life. But I guess the thing to do is hope it's not forever.

<P>I'm taking some classes, trying to get to a more normal life. I'm still pretty desperate and miserable, but the hope is that I'm setting my self up for a better life if things ever get better...that's all I've got.

<P>Sorry guys, false alarm, this stuff didn't help.

<P>good luck to you guys.<br><br><CENTER>

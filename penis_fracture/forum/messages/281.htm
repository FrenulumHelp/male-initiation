<P>I'm not exactly sure what its called to tell you the truth.<br>I'll find out and let you know.......and as far as things healing themself........it just doesn't happen....if it hasn't happened yet, it won't.....at least thats my standpoint. I've had a couple different injuries over the years where I was told to do just that and my body did always heal it enough where it didn't physically hurt......but things never seem to work right again without surgical intervention.

<P>>Definetly hoping for you brother. <br>>My doctor has yet to perform the doppler he's big on hoping that things will fix them selves, i've had this problem for 2.5 years, so I'm less into that, but I have a hard time saying " NO! CUT ME OPEN!"<br>>good to hear about your problem being focused. Is the procedure that they're going to do on you called a Venous Ligation?<CENTER><P><HR></p></CENTER><input type=hidden name="followup" value="264,265,266,267,268,269,270,271,277,278,279,280,281"><input type=hidden name="origname" value="Joshua"><input type=hidden name="origsubject" value="Re: Penile Fracture Question"><input type=hidden name="origdate" value="20 Mar 2007 15:04:32"><input type=hidden name="subject" value="Re: Penile Fracture Question"><br><CENTER>

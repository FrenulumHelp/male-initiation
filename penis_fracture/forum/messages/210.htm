<P>My name is Max. I am 25 years old. I found many useful information in this forum. I was doing some penis enlargement exerccises. I know that was very stupid thing to do. I am not doing it anymore. I was exercising the part close to testicles. That part of my penis used to be stiff during erection, now it is soft. I can not get a full erection. It just seems to be loose at the base. I can get a full erection for only couple of seconds when I touch myself. After I stop touching myself, my penis falls down in the matter of seconds. It is full with bloob, but not stiff enough to be erected. It just seems it is losing blood very fast. Do you think I have a venous leak?<BR><BR><CENTER>

<P>Hi stevo,

<P>thanks for the clarification and education. yes "a lack in blood flow, (venous leakage)" was incorrect. Very good description.

<P>(also I posted something for you down below on your thread)

<P>thanks

<P>robin

<P>>I have to correct you about one thing robin. Venous leak (what i've come to learn is the main reason for my ED) is not a lack of blood flow in.<br>>when a man gets an erection the two corporal bodies are inflate with such pressure, that they pinch shut the viens. Veins take blood OUT of the penis. So when they're pinched shut, a mans erection is maintained and solid, because he has a lot of blood goign in, and none going out.<br>>....unless his veins (like mine, and perhaps this gentleman's) are leaking.<br>><br>>treatment for venous leak is seldom sucesful, there are surgeries called venous ligation, they range in SHORT TERM SUCCESS from 10-30%, if you're a candidate. If you do in fact have a venous leak you my have to consider a penile prosthesis: hydrolic cylinders being put inside you're dick.<br>>sadly I've seen pictures, and videos of these robo-dicks and they produce erections that are quite small....better than cutting it off though.<CENTER><P><HR></p></CENTER><input type=hidden name="followup" value="223,233,241"><input type=hidden name="origname" value="Robin"><input type=hidden name="origsubject" value="venous leakage"><input type=hidden name="origdate" value="07 Dec 2006 18:39:17"><input type=hidden name="subject" value="Re: venous leakage"><br><CENTER>

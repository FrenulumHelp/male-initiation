<P>Hi, Recently i have had a circumcision done to relieve the pain caused by Phimosis. Now i know that i am still in the recovery time as the surgery was just over a week ago but i am finding that i am having an unsual amount of pain during partial erection in the base of my Penis near where the shaft and Testical sack meet. It runs approx half way up my shaft on both sides and is very painful. I am kind of worried and was wondering if anyone else has had this issue and if it is common place for post opperation. It is kind of worrying me for future as to whether i will be able to have a non painful errection. 

<P>Please let me know. <BR><BR><CENTER>

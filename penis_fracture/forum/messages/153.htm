<P><BR>Hello,

<P>I was trying to find a message on your forum that was a similar story  <BR>to my husbands, but I was unable to. Almost 3 weeks ago my husband  <BR>and I were in the shower together. We were not having sexual  <BR>intercourse but we were rubbing against each other. His penis  <BR>collided with my pelvic bone with a significant amount of force at a  <BR>perpendicular force. When this happened he said it felt like a crack  <BR>but we didn't hear anything. His penis remained erect, there was no  <BR>visible damage to the penis while flaccid or erect. Now there is  <BR>still pain just under the tip of his penis and makes sexual  <BR>intercourse uncomfortable.

<P>Because there was no signs of bleeding or bruising we just thought it  <BR>would go away within a few days but now my husband is affraid to have  <BR>sex because of the pain. He does not have pain urinating or at any  <BR>other time besides when it is fully erect.

<P>Is there any suggestions as to what you might think this is?

<P>Thank you<BR>Ky<BR><BR><!-- AnfangLinie --><CENTER><HR></p></CENTER><!-- EndeLinie -->

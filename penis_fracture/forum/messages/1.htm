<P>extract from my answer

<P>A very complex experience; condom tearing the foreskin? <BR>this needs more explanation - I hope the above forum will <BR>solve your problem

<P>

<P>Hello there, I have a big problem with my penis. I<BR>am 23 years old and have sicker cells. I am not<BR>circumcised and when my penis gets hard it is bent<BR>to the left. The problem that I am having is that<BR>I will be sleeping and it will stat to get hard. I<BR>thought that it was a mind thing that I could have<BR>controled, But I cant. It gets so hard sometimes<BR>that it starts to have some sharp stinging pain on<BR>the left side of my shaft. When it gets hard<BR>around the lower part of the head gets very<BR>sensitive. Sometimes I wake up with it hurting so<BR>bad I cant have sex. Because during sex it hurts<BR>also. When trying to ejaculate it starts to sting<BR>and a flash burning feeling comes on. I tried<BR>every thing to eased my pain, jumping jacks,<BR>hot/cold showers, ice pack, push up anything to<BR>clear my mind but it wont work. About 3 years ago<BR>my girlfriend an I was about to have sex. We were<BR>planning to try something new. So I went an bought<BR>a stud 100 and some life style color condoms.<BR>Stupid! I usually buy magnums the extra large<BR>ones, but they did not have any. Hence we got back<BR>home and was going to have sex. I placed the<BR>condom on a was about to put it in. All of a<BR>sudden I felt that the condom was getting warm a<BR>burning me. I pulled out just in time to see the<BR>outcome. The condom tore the skin of my penis in<BR>half. Something like tight rubberband on your<BR>wrist.I had to get 21 stiches around my penis .Do<BR>you think that my be on of my problem........<BR>Please reply<CENTER><P><HR></p></CENTER><BR><!-- AnfangLinie --><!-- EndeLinie -->

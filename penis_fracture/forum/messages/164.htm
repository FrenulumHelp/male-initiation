<P>Hi Stevo,

<P>Please understand my doubts about the Peyronnies diagnosis, this seems a common suspicion that the doctors have, but I dont remeber your problems starting slowly and gradually becoming worse, and as I understand the situation, this is what must happen with peyronnies.

<P>Compressed nitrates to kill an erection - interesting - never heard that before - be interested if they work.

<P>I actually believe my "new thought" last week was pretty clever ... have you considered going to a sports doctor (an Orthopedic doctor)? otherwise I guess its just a few more weeks attempted abstinence and hoping and praying for you.

<P>I wish you the best luck in the world.

<P>Robin

<P><BR>>The doctor at UCLA says that I may have peyronie's but that before we settle on that terrible (and uncureable) solution he wanted me to take scar inhibitors and anti inflamatories for 6 weeks and give it total rest. He even gave me some compressed nitrates i can snort in case i need to kill an erection.<BR>>while he couldn't FEEL scar tissue he said there's a good chance that it's there, just to small to feel.<BR>>but the fact that i still have pain may hopefully indicate that my problem is an unhealed wound, and not scar tissue. <BR>>Here's to hopin.<CENTER><P><HR></p></CENTER><BR><!-- AnfangLinie --><!-- EndeLinie -->

<P>Robin, I am not sure what I am going to do.  I am not crazy about the surgery thing myself.  I would say the bend is at least 20 degrees.  When it happened there was no tremendous pain, just a snapping sound, and when I withdrew it was bent.  I have quite a tolerance for pain because of life on the edge lifestyle.  I still have sex, but am concerned that it is a weak point, and could re fracture in the same spot if not repaired.  I also agree on your theory of "how do they know how much".  One doctor told me to take vitamin E, and it would soften the scar tissue.  I am a technical type person, and approach almost everything in life with a  technical attitude.  It just seems to work for me that way.  I am not looking to be longer than I am, as obviously that is what got me in trouble in the first place, but I have considered that approach as a means of straightening the bend out, and may try that before seriously considering the surgery.   <BR><BR>I honestly wish you and the others in worse condition  well.  Possibly through the work you are doing, an answer may surface that the medical community hasn't thought of.  I wish you the best, 

<P>I will keep the forum on my computer, and when I make a move toward a solution, I will be happy to share what results I have found. 

<P>Best Wishes, 

<P>Dave<BR><BR><CENTER>

<P>Hi Larry,

<P>you say I may well be right - thank you - very diplomatic - but the terrible truth on these matters, is that I may well be wrong.

<P>I dont claim to know the answers, only the questions. 

<P>I suppose any trauma in any part of the body could cause a previous trauma to re-manifest.

<P>I think it would help me and anyone else reading to know what prostatis is. - Really you probably know more about this than I do, so educate me please ...

<P>wish you good luck with the antibiotics ... 

<P>cheers

<P>Robin 

<P><BR>>Well you might be right Robin, thought I suspect that every case is a little bit different.   After a week of close to no symptoms, I now have what appears to be prostatis.   I had that 3 years ago and the symptoms are very similar.   The doctor believes that I had a chronic prostatis and that the trauma caused it to come out of dormancy.   I don't know if that makes sense or not, but certainly the symptoms are almost identical to what I had before.   It took a long while to get rid of it and antibiotics did not really work (in spite of that I am back on them in the hope that they will).<BR>>Has anyone else with a history of prostatitis found that a penis injury causes it to recur ??<BR>>Larry<BR><BR><CENTER>

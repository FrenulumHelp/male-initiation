<P>Hello Max,

<P>I dont know many answers, but somehow I suspect that if you had a venous leak this would influence the entire erection not just the base. 

<P>You dont say anything about if there was an injury etc. - do you think this problem developed purely because of the penis enlarger?  - I often think the sort of injuries which we get on this forum may be better considered as a sports injury.

<P>I can only suggest you go to an Urologist and ask him. (and come back and tell us the result).

<P>cheers and good luck<BR>Robin<CENTER>

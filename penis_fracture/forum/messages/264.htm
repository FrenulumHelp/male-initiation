<P>I suffered a penile fracture on 11/11/06. I was having sex with my wife and I was about to ejaculate. However, when I was about to pull my penis out, I heard a popping sound and begin to shoot blood out of the end of my penis. I had my wife call 911 while I stood in the bath tub and blood continued to drain from my penis. I would say it was consistant with a cut to the artery. The blood was pulsing out as if connected to my heart beat. With the blood loss, my penis deflated like a balloon that had been popped. I wrapped a towel around it and waited on the ambulance to take me to the hospital. The paramedic said I lost over a liter of blood and that would explain while I was light headed and felt like I was going to pass out.

<P>Upon arrival to the emergency room I was asked what was wrong. At this point my bleeding almost stopped, I believe its because the erection was gone which sealed up the wound just like a tire would leak if it had a nail in it...until the tire self sealed. I was asked to urinate for them which I painfully did and I was then taken to the xray room. At this point the doctor inserted a tube into my urethra and injected some kind of dye. This was extremely painful. He then did it again.....afterwards I was sent back to my room. I waited an additional 30 minutes or so and was told that I didn't need surgery and that they were going to give me a catheter and send me on my way.

<P>So the next day I'm sent to see a specialist (urologist) and he looks at my penis and says to keep the catheter in for a few more days.....On day 5 I see another urologist who then removes the catheter. Everything is good to go.......or so I thought. After another 4 weeks which I'm told to not have sex........I wait and wait....then on week 5, I try to have sex with my wife....but my penis will not become erect...not the way it should. Not enough to safely have sex with my wife. I go back to the the urology building and see another doctor. He advises me that its psychological and that they are going to give me viagra to try and get over the hurdle. So I take the viagra and attempt to have sex with my wife.......again its not erect like it should be and it bends and almost, in my mind, breaks again as it bent pretty severely due to the fact that it wasn't erect like it should be. 

<P>I go back to the doctor and he says stop taking the pills........and thats it.....

<P>I'm left hanging. 

<P>I have done extensive amounts of researching online about this penile fracture. Almost every single paper I reade states that blood in the urine or urethra indicates a urethra injury that requires surgery..........and that if surgery isn't done there can be complications such as ED.

<P>My question is........why didn't the ER doc or the first urologist or any urologist for that matter....why didn't they mention surgery to me as an option. I would think losing a liter of blood through the urethra would indicate a significant tear that would warrant surgery....I'm not contemplating getting a lawyer as I believe the urologist that first saw me was unfit to do his job and has caused me alot more pain than needed to be....

<P>Could you please offer any advice......<BR><BR><CENTER>

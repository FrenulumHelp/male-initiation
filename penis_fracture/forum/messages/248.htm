<P>Hi anyone and everyone with so called “atypical penis fracture/nerve trauma”, 

<P>Please leave a detailed account of the <B>CAUSES</B> and <B>SYMPTOMS</B> of your problem, otherwise you help no-one and no-one here can help you.

<P>The main optimistic point is that at least we can contact each other these days with www. I often wonder how it was even 20 yrs. ago, left totally alone with this problem, - I think Id have gone crazy without www. Men with our problems must have been going crazy throughout the last centuries. 

<P>Ive been trying to start a group now for a long time – and Im not getting anywhere. If you disagree with the idea of a group, then please tell me what other alternative we have??!! Im now going to take a break for a while. This is simply to give me a break and try something new to see what happens – maybe then others will start taking over. 

<P>I believe that isolated and individual we will be as lost as the men pre interet - the chance we have today is as a group.

<P>So many of "us" have been to countless urologists for countless tests - and somehow we and the doctors are not getting results - so what are WE doing wrong that we could do better? - maybe even my naming of atypical penis fracture/nerve trauma confuses doctors?

<P>I feel its no use asking doctors to look at just “me” - the medical world cant be blamed on this subject - they have to think practically - our problem occurs perhaps one in 10,000 - any individual doctor probably sees only one case in his life!

<P>This forum and home page are rapidly becoming a collection of evidence on penis trauma/atypical fracture. I feel our collective need is our only hope (or certainly our main hope) of getting this problem recognised, and researched.

<P>Please contribute to this forum and talk with each other - dont expect me to answer. <BR>Please think how a group can change a situation which individually we will never change.

<P>If you disagree TELL ME WHAT OTHER ALTERNATIVE WE HAVE APART FROM A GROUP??!!

<P>I feel what we need is a student Urologist to answer letters on the forum. Students have time to research, and a last year student doing a special research on this subject would be ideal - they are always looking for new subjects to write diploma work.

<P>Im NOT online at home - I dont have the possibility to do internet research. Please leave links and comments on other www addresses which deal with these subjects - so that an index or network of relevant pages can be developed. (Someone recently left a link which enabled me to write to an online urology faculty asking if anyone can help this forum)

<P>Id love someone to spend a couple of hours using their “worry” energy positively to google for medical universities (esp. Urology dept.) and collect 50 or even 10 e mail addresses, ... and then send out spam like invitations to help ...

<P><B>links</B>

<P>for normal or typical penis fracture emergency instructions <A HREF="191.htm"> messages/191.htm</A> and <A HREF="http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic3415.htm"> e medical library on typical fracture </A>

<P>(with this quote): “Patients with a rupture of the deep dorsal vein of the penis can present with findings similar to those of a penile fracture. Associated swelling and ecchymosis of the penis (“eggplant” sign) is present. .... However, the patient does not typically hear a crack or popping sound. In addition, detumescence does not immediately occur. However, because of similar physical examination findings, a deep dorsal vein rupture should be surgical explored, as it is often difficult to differentiate from penile fracture.”

<P>for Sports doctor see <A HREF="238.htm">messages/238.htm</A>

<P>Abstinence possibly for several months is the only treatment idea which sometimes seems to work for minor injuries. For a couple of ideas on abstinence see thread starting <A HREF="36.htm">messages/36.htm</A>

<P>for pelvic floor disorder see <A HREF="159.htm">messages/159.htm</A>

<P>for ideas on “being a man” even with a broken penis see <A HREF="146.htm">messages/146.htm</A> and <A HREF="138.htm">messages/138.htm</A> and <A HREF="237.htm"> “If” by Rudyard Kipling </A>

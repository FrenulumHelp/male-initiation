<P>Hi Jim,

<P>Hell, Im sorry, but I have no idea about most of the questions on this forum, even though I try and answer. Please dont take anything I say seriously without consulting a doctor

<P>OK this hard area, could it be calcification, could you have peyronnies? ... is there any bending of the erection? (another symptom of peyronnies) - sorry if so, my site and knowledge is totally unequipped to handle peyronnies, so you would need another www search for this. As far as I know peyronnies - calcification develops slowly and cannot develop quickly. 

<P>Otherwise, what could it be? - harder areas in the penis are not a typical symptom for this forum so really I have nothing to relate it to. 

<P>I have heard of pains developing without any injury, but it is also the exception for the letters I get ... 

<P>How old are you? where are you from? are doctors/specialists easy to see in your part of the world?

<P>I always ask that if anytime you discover cause or cure to your problem, PLEASE come back and tell us here. Sorry I dont think theres more I can say.

<P>good luck<BR>Robin<UL><!--insert: 151--></UL><!--end: 151--><HR class=hrparsi></BLOCKQUOTE></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><CENTER><A HREF="../index.htm"><B>Back to Old </B>(edited)<B> Forum Index</B></A><BR><FONT SIZE="5"><A HREF="../../index.html#start">Atypical Fracture Index</A></FONT></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

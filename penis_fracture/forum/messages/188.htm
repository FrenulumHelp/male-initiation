<P>As an answer to: <A HREF="187.htm">Question about pains in Penis</A> written by Dat at 13 Jul 2006 18:51:57:

<P>Hello Dat,

<P>You have sharp, sort of prickly pains at the base of the penis. The<BR>pains which I have over years are extreme, but similar problems come in<BR>every different strength and variety, It seems the penis and its<BR>musculature is much more fragile and easy to damage than our cultural<BR>picture of the strong erect penis ... I dont want to worry you, but it<BR>sounds like you might have the start of some problems.

<P>How old are you?

<P>Naturally the professional advice is go to an Urologist. However<BR>it appears the rare cases the urologists have seen they diagnose as<BR>psychosomatic, and because individual men have learnt not to complain<BR>about their penis, the doctors have never acknowledged such pains and<BR>such complaints have to my knowledge never been studied by the medical<BR>profession.

<P>I cant say much more without a more detailed desription, is it a nerve a<BR>muscle or a bruise??? I have no idea - please write in say 3 months time with<BR>any description of developments.

<P>cheers

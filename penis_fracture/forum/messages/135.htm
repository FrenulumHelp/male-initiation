<P>Dude, leave it the fuck alone, let it rest, i mean good and rest for at least a month.

<P>I know you're horny, and i know you're also freaked out, an dyou'd love a chance to rpove to yourself that it works, and put your mind at ease.

<P>When my problem began, if i'd shown the type of restraint that i'm asking you to show, i might have  avoided so much pain and shame.

<P>You're really playing with your life man. let it rest. please.<UL><!--insert: 135--></UL><!--end: 135--><HR class=hrparsi></BLOCKQUOTE></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><CENTER><A HREF="../index.htm"><B>Back to Old </B>(edited)<B> Forum Index</B></A><BR><FONT SIZE="5"><A HREF="../../index.html#start">Atypical Fracture Index</A></FONT></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

<P>Hi Ammar,

<P>I was thinking over the week, and believing this to be some terrible skin disease, I thought skin specialists are dermatologists, and maybe you should try one. However now I learn that the skin ripped  internally ... so the thinning of the skin and discolouration was probably bruising as a result.

<P>I do firmly believe that Urologists havent got a clue about our sort of complaint and they are not trained for complex erectile difficulties - I have a suspicion that Sports doctors might know something about ripped muscles ligaments etc. - but obviously I am as clueless as yourself ... it definately needs to try in directions other than urology, maybe a doctor versed in Chinese medicine, maybe accupuncture, ... There must be a cause and a cure for what we have - but I dont know what -

<P>could the dorsal vein or the pelvic links which I gave you be any use? 

<P>so stick around if you want, (Im here every Thursday (at present)) 

<P>Cheers

<P>Robin

<P>>Hi Robin. Thank you for the reply.<BR>><BR>>I felt the skin tear internally . Then everything went to hell form there. I just dont know what to do right now and where to turn. <CENTER><P><HR></p></CENTER><BR><!-- AnfangLinie --><!-- EndeLinie -->

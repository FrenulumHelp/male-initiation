<P>Cocoa Rageous,

<P>Sorry to hear of your circumstances. Can you go into more detail? I didn't realise scateboarding was such a dangerous sport. Please can you tell us the exact situation that you were in? How the injury occurred? Who have you seen and what has been their prognosis? Are/have you undergone any tests etc? Do you get any erections at all? Morning/night?

<P>There could be some soft tissue damage, depending on what the extent of you accident was. Has there been any change in urination (regularity etc)?

<P>Louis

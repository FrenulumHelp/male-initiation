<P>Hi Shiloh,

<P>In addition to Stevo's reply. Your injury is probably not very severe, please come back if you still have any pain in a few weeks time. Abstinence is about the only cure for bruising, so if you bruised your penis, best take a break from sex for a few days.

<P>Robin<BR>>bleeding from the urethra is certain sufficient to at least see a doctor. if not visit the emergency room. I suppose if this happened a few day sago, there's no point in going to the hospital. If you did in fact need immediate help, well that window has past. Maybe, hopefully it isn't that big a deal. But definetly go see a doctor.<BR><BR></P><BR><!-- AnfangLinie --><!-- EndeLinie -->

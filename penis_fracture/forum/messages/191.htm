<P>>This is probably a penis fracture, an emergency situation. People on the internet cannot help you with this, you need to see a doctor or go to the emergency room immediately and tell them what happened.

<P>This is correct and thank you Jensin

<P>See<A HREF="emergency.htm">EMERGENCY instructions  </A>

<P><B>But on rereading it seems like external bleeding and so I wonder if this was actually a frenulum breve ripping  (the band under the glans can rip causing profuse bleeding - usually congeals itself though is reported bleeding to death) </B><BR><HR class=hrparsi></BLOCKQUOTE></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><CENTER><A HREF="../index.htm"><B>Back to Old </B>(edited)<B> Forum Index</B></A><BR><FONT SIZE="5"><A HREF="../../index.html#start">Atypical Fracture Index</A></FONT></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

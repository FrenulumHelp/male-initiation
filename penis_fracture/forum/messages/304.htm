<P>David Hi,

<P>you must give a better description, internal bleeding can be connected with penile fracture. 

<P>Otherwise bleeding from the urinary opening can be caused by various things ... which we dont cover in this forum, but doctors would understand most of the reasons for blood in the urine ... blood leaking could also be frenulum breve which has ripped .... (search google) 

<P>Whatever either you are on the wrong forum - or you need to give a better description of your problem.

<P>cheers<br>Robin

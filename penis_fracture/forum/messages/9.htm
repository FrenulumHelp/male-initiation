<P><BR>Hello, 

<P>I am writing to tell you of the pain my husband has. First <BR>of all he is a very proud 39 year old Southern man who <BR>refuses to go to the doctor on this subject so has chosen <BR>to put us both through this horror!

<P>About a year ago, while having sex; my husband experienced <BR>a very sharp pain in his scrotum. It was so sharp it <BR>brought tears to his eyes. He moved quickly and held <BR>himself for a moment and then tried to continue but his <BR>erection fell. 

<P>He says he has the pain often and we've only had sex a few <BR>times since then. My prior statement may have seemed <BR>selfish when I said he has chosen to put us both through <BR>this horror, however it wasn't meant to sound selfish. To <BR>me, it isn't about sex. We've always had a fabulous sex <BR>life. Sex is a very strong and real part of both our lives. 

<P>But why it is a horror to me is that I love him! I can't <BR>stand to see him in pain! I can't stand to see him let his <BR>pride get in the way of his health. Women are subjected to <BR>humiliating examinations all the time. Why is it that men <BR>feel that they should be immune to this? 

<P>I hope this in some way can help you with your research. I <BR>was surfing the web trying to find an answer to help him <BR>myself and stumbled across your site. <BR>You are a very brave and secure man to have been able to <BR>create such a site. 

<P>I applaud you and wish you healing.

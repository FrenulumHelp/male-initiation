<P>"If"

<P>If you can keep your head when all about you<br>Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,<br>If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you<br>But make allowance for their doubting too,<br>If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,<br>Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,<br>Or being hated, don't give way to hating,<br>And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

<P>If you can dream--and not make dreams your master,<br>If you can think--and not make thoughts your aim;<br>If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster<br>And treat those two impostors just the same;<br>If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken<br>Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,<br>Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,<br>And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

<P>If you can make one heap of all your winnings<br>And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,<br>And lose, and start again at your beginnings<br>And never breathe a word about your loss;<br>If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew<br>To serve your turn long after they are gone,<br>And so hold on when there is nothing in you<br>Except the Will which says to them: "Hold on!"

<P>If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,<br>Or walk with kings--nor lose the common touch,<br>If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you;<br>If all men count with you, but none too much,<br>If you can fill the unforgiving minute<br>With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,<br>Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,<br>And--which is more--you'll be a Man, my son!

<P>By Rudyard Kipling (1865-1936).

<P>hi Toc

<P>i'm not sure if you will still be checking this spot, but after finding this explanation i immediately knew that your symptoms match mine pretty closely. I've had this kind of problem for around 6 months now (two urologists have been unable to find what's wrong) - I also live in the UK and have experienced the lack of knowledge of this area evident in the NHS. If you're reading this, it would be much appreciated if you could inform me how you may have gone about the problem since you posted. Thanks

<P>m

<P>>Dear Toc,<br>>Sorry mate but I only know the questions, I dont know any answers. It<br>>really is a case of the blind leading the blind.<br>>One optimistic thought is that at least the blind can contact the<br>>blind these days with www. I often wonder how it was even 20 yrs. ago,<br>>my God to be left feeling totally alone with this problem, and then<br>>questioning myself on if Im imagining it I think Id have gone crazy.<br>>And men with our problem must have been going crazy for all the last<br>>centuries. I am very thankful to www --- I have had pages up on this<br>>subject since around 8 yrs. - about a year ago I put up a new format<br>>and opened the forum, at present Im getting around one letter every<br>>week from someone with a similar problem ...<br>>I will anonymise this letter and also post it on the forum, I cant see<br>>any other way except to make the need known publically. (my<br>>disclaimers quite clear on this point)<br>>I have a very similar problem to you, with bending, weak erection, I<br>>do feel sexual when I ejaculate, but usually it is without having an<br>>erection ... I had my injury ten yrs. ago, I gave up with the doctors<br>>after the first 5 yrs.<br>>From your letter I really dont understand how it started. You say "It<br>>all started when... After an intense bout of masturbation, I<br>>ejaculated, but immediately after so much experienced i stop it<br>>gradually." - what the hell does this mean? "but immediately after so<br>>much experienced i stop it gradually."<br>>The bending and the failure of erection indicates to me that you have<br>>had an atypical penis fracture - but I dont know how this could have<br>>happened to you. I often hear of this sort of problem after intense<br>>masturbation or an excessively large erection.<br>>The only advice I can give which might in some cases help, is with complete<br>>abstinence the self healing processes may start working ...<br>>Im afraid I just dont know the solution to the problem - and at 23<br>>yrs. old it is a greater problem than with 53 yrs. - Id be happy to<br>>consider with you how to live with it ... if you want to discuss this<br>>... But also here I have no good solutions, its very frustrating I<br>>realise this, and if you want to tell me your thoughts - you are welcome.<br>>sorry, wish I could help more, at least you know you are not alone,<br>>and that might help a bit. I can only add that someday I am hoping<br>>something may come of a collection of "us" on the forum.<br>>If you request, I could also put you on a mailing list should I ever<br>>learn anything about what the hell it is and how to cure it.<br>>Cheers<br>>Robin<br>>________________________________________<br>>I feel we need an index of all the penis fracture sites and erectile dysfunction - impotence resources etc. online. But, Im NOT online at home - I dont have the possibility to do internet research - Please leave links and comments on other www addresses which deal with these subjects - so that an index or network of relevant "impotence - erectile dysfunction" pages can be developed.<br>>Actually I feel what we need is a student Urologist to answer letters on the forum. Students have time to research, and a last year student doing a special research on this subject would be ideal - they are always looking for new subjects to write diploma work.<br>>Id love someone to spend a couple of hours using their "worry" energy positively to google for medical universities (esp. Urology dept.) and collect 50 or even 20 e mail addresses, and post the addresses on the forum, ... and then I can send out spam like invitations to help the research ... <br>>________________________________________<br>><br>>>Dear Robin,<br>>>THANK YOU! <br>>>  <br>>>Your website is the first place in the world where I see my probem is written. I have seen many doctors and they all seem to be confused. I REGRETABLY HAVE EXPERIRNCED THIS NERVE TRAUMA MENTIONED MORE THAN 3 YEARS AGO! It has ruined my sex life since. i was  20 when it happened. Now I'm 23 and I don't know what to do. <br>>>  <br>>>It all started when... After an intense bout of masturbation, I ejaculated, but immediately after so much experienced i stop it gradually. Now i don't have anymore strong erection but I have lost all sexual sunsitivity. It is really awful because I can ejaculate but not feel anything sexual at all. I seldom get erections. My penis has started to curve to the left and doctors cannot say what is wrong. PLEASE, since you have mentioned on the website, do you know what i will do.  I would be grateful to you forever if you can help me... <br>>>  <br>>>Thanks for your  time. <br>>>  <br>>>Best regards,<br>>>Toc<CENTER><P><HR></p></CENTER><input type=hidden name="followup" value="100,101,231"><input type=hidden name="origname" value="m"><input type=hidden name="origemail" value="omm116-at-yahoo.co.uk"><input type=hidden name="origsubject" value="Re: Nerve Trauma"><input type=hidden name="origdate" value="28 Nov 2006 20:49:35"><input type=hidden name="subject" value="Re: Nerve Trauma"><br><CENTER>

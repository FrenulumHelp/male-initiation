<P>As an answer to: <A HREF="153.htm">Erection pain</A> written by Ky at 15 Jun 2006 19:22:58:

<P>Hello Ky,

<P>First - there are a number of reports on this, I cant remember exactly<BR>where, maybe on the home page on male-initiation.net. Whatever, I have heard<BR>often of hitting the pelvic bone, and similar causes, hitting against<BR>the desk his wife was sitting on, falling out of bed with night<BR>erection hitting floor. the causes are all very similar.

<P>But their effects seem very hard to catergorize.

<P>What it could be is just very similar to the majority of cases I hear<BR>about, but it seems quite a mild variety. It seems the penis and its<BR>musculature is very fragile ... these areas have simply not been<BR>researched because previous to internet men just never would talk<BR>about their genital problems, it is still considered very bad taste<BR>to do this, so we all get stuck behind our egos, the doctors analysed<BR>the rare cases they saw as psychosomatic, fitting to Freudian<BR>psychology etc. and simply no-doctor seems to have researched these<BR>problems.

<P>It felt like a crack, interesting, and probably was a soft<BR>crack (hey, my advice is totally unprofessional, see a doctor), it seems when<BR>there is a loud crack then the typical fracture occurs which seem to heal<BR>without any great problem.

<P>He is only in pain when fully erect - so when the area is not under<BR>tension (flaccid) there is no pain even when he explores in, presses<BR>or bends the area?

<P>The (it seems the official) medical advice for such pains is to<BR>practice abstinence for six weeks - this seems to be because doctors have<BR>no idea what could be causing such pains - it is a good idea because<BR>if this is a sprain or a strain then one should rest it like one does<BR>with any other part of the body.

<P>If the pain is localised under the glans, then its not a nerve which<BR>is being trapped or torn etc. so I reckon this is the sort of pain which will<BR>cure after several weeks abstinence.

<P>Either that or you must visit a doctor. Try a Sports doctor (see note underneath footnote)

<P>Please at least write back in 3 months time to say what happened. I<BR>hate it when people/men are so egoistical that when they get better,<BR>they dont bother telling me/us/those with permanent problems what<BR>happened and how they cured it. Sorry - But I seem to be in rather <BR>an angry mood about male egos today.

<P>Cheers

<P>Robin

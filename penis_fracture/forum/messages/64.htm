<P>I share the problem of a fractured penis. I have searched for answers and help for a long time and I may or may not have come across the solution. I was 17 when I got injured, it was on the first day I ever did anything with a girl... the agonizing irony. Since then (and even before) I've been very much ashamed to really try and get sexual with any female. I guess i have a lot to be thankful for, though, my penis works fine, there is no pain, only a slight bend to it, which is humiliating to me, along with some softness around the spot where I heard the dreaded "cracking" sound. I have been diagnosed with peyronie's disease which is when you form a plaque (could be from an injury, or it doesnt have to be) causing your penis to bend.

<P>Firstly, I would like your help, anyone's help here who can answer this. I know peyronie's disease is the formation of plaque. But I seem to have a something odd around the spot of my injury. It's like a line under the skin, like if I pass my finger through I can feel a little thin soft bump. My question is, I'm not sure whether to think this is plaque or a hematoma of sorts. I always thought the plaque was just the hardening of the tissue in a wide area on the penis, I havn't read anywhere that there are lumps or bumps or anything like that associated with plaque. Does anyone have an idea? I am still not familiar with the concept of plaque when it comes to the penis even though I've looked around extensively.

<P>Now, for the good part. In my searches I have come across a new medical device being used widely in Europe and starting to be adopted into the American medical fields. It is a penis "extender" and there are tests that show it removes plaque of the penis significantly, and effectively treats peyronie's disease with a high success rate. The documentation and everything associated therein seems accurate and legit. There are doctors names as well as scientific journals linked and quoted.

<P>One website for this device is www.jes-extender.dk which has a nice forum to discuss things in but if you're going to buy it I would recommend doing so from www.sizegenetics.com which is cheaper and comes with a lot more stuff (they are an official reseller of the jes extender).

<P>Hopefully someone can try this out for their injuries or peyronie's disease while keeping us up to date on their condition before and after, with many details such as the type of injury and a detailed description of the anatomical effect it had on your penis then the results of using the device. I have yet to meet anyone who used this for their injury or peyronie's disease but it is used in the medical field in Europe for it.

<P>I would have done so long a go but I am worried about that bump I was speaking of. Maybe if someone can clear up for me whether its a hematoma, plaque or something else, I'll look into the device but until then I'm worried the device will make it worse so I'm just sharing it with you all in case it might help you out.

<P>Please keep in touch and keep us informed. Together we can work a lot better than apart. Oh, please don't forget any input on my personal situation and condition is appreciated.<BR><BR><!-- AnfangLinie --><BR><!-- AnfangLinie --><!-- EndeLinie -->

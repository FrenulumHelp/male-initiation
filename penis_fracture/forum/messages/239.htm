<P>Stevo, a couple of things occur to me during the week –

<P>From what I remember at the start you had a lot of pain - has the pain now gone? And actually you were so crazy when you were first writing that I dont think there is a good clear account of your causes and symptoms – maybe you could write this out now as a sort of cool calm record – (and give it some special “subject title” so that I know where to find it in future)

<P>And then a question – you have seen this footnote I stick on any new letter, I will enclose it here as well – could we/you modify this to try and meet your present needs? How? 

<P>Cheers<BR>Robin

<P><BR>I include my normal footnote<BR>_______________________________________<BR>One optimistic thought is that at least we can contact each other these days with www.<BR>I often wonder how it was even 20 yrs. ago, left totally alone with this problem, - I think Id have gone crazy without www. Men with our problems must have been going crazy throughout the last centuries.

<P>Isolated and individual we will be as lost as the men pre interet - the chance we have today is as a group.

<P>This forum and home page are becoming a collection of evidence on penis trauma/atypical fracture. I feel our collective need is our only hope (or certainly our main hope) of getting this problem recognised, and researched.

<P>I wish others on the forum would come back and participate, everyone seems to want to go it alone or just give up ... and thats going to result in the same results that it has done for the last 1000 years : nothing.

<P>its no use asking doctors to look at just “me” - the medical world cant be blamed on this subject - they have to think practically - our problem occurs perhaps one in 5,000 - any individual doctor probably sees only one case in his life -

<P>So many of "us" have been to countless urologists for countless tests - and somehow we and the doctors are not getting results - so what are WE doing wrong that we could do better -

<P>please think how a group can change a situation which individually we will never change.

<P>Please contribute to this forum and talk with each other - dont just expect me to answer.

<P>If you disagree TELL ME WHAT OTHER ALTERNATIVE WE HAVE APART FROM A<BR>GROUP??!!

<P>I feel what we need is a student Urologist to answer letters on the forum. Students have time to research, and a last year student doing a special research on this subject would be ideal - they are always looking for new subjects to write diploma work.

<P>Im NOT online at home - I dont have the possibility to do internet research.<BR>Please leave links and comments on other www addresses<BR>which deal with these subjects - so that an index or network of<BR>relevant pages can be developed. (Someone recently left a link which<BR>enabled me to write to an online urology faculty asking if anyone can<BR>help)

<P>Id love someone to spend a couple of hours using their “worry” energy positively to google for medical universities (esp. Urology dept.) and collect 50 or even 10 e mail addresses, ... and then send out spam like invitations to help ...

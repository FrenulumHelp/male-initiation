<P>As an answer to: <A HREF="89.htm">erectile dysfunction - please help</A> written by Mani at 15 Feb 2006 18:23:00:

<P>Hi Mani,

<P>first off Im not a doctor, only a fellow patient who believes in<BR>helping each other.

<P>The main thing I can offer is interest and sympathy, I have very few<BR>answers - The first thing I must suggest is that you go to a<BR>Urologist, and then I would be very interested in what he can tell<BR>you.

<P>My foremost suggestion, is if it feels like a sprain or muscle tear<BR>then handle it like one, this means rest it, and this means<BR>abstinence.

<P>The fact that you still get morning erections, "involuntary"<BR>erections, usually means that the problem is psychosomatic ... I dont<BR>agree with this diagnosis but it is the normal interpretation, what it<BR>does definately mean is there is no problem with the blood supply to<BR>your penis.

<P>I find the viral infection interesting, you seem to feel this has had<BR>an influence, and I have heard this before.

<P>What happened in October 2004??? This is a very important question. An<BR>interpretation of your condition is impossible without knowing this.

<P>Remember losing your mind is far worse than losing your erection, so<BR>stay cool calm and collected. I hope you will go to a Urologist. I<BR>hope you will tell me what the cause and cure of your problem is ... I<BR>am just a fellow sufferer .... I also have something like a muscle<BR>sprain at the base of my penis, since 10 yrs, I have not been able to<BR>find a cure or any treatment .... maybe your solution could help<BR>someone else or even me, so please contact me if and when you<BR>understand anything more.

<P>cheers

<P>Robin.

<P>Most of these mysterious erectile dysfunctions require men to help each other - and long term reports are essential - please come back in a years time and report progress.

<P>>Dr Stuart,<BR>>    I have a big problem and request your help and guidance. For the past 1 month, I am unable to get an erection and have been experiencing a lot of pain around the base of my penis. Looks like there is a muscle tear or sprain and feels as if the muscle is weak to support the enlargement.<BR>>I have had this problem on and off since Oct of 2004 but over the last few months of 2005, I thought the problem was over. During December 2005, my family had viral fevers but I probably got a mild attack with just body and muscular pain. Since then I have not been able to have an erection but I do get my morning erections during sleep.<BR>>I fear that the muscular tear or sprain has not healed and keeps showing up now and then disturbing my married life. This causes me a lot of grief and tension.<BR>>Please help.<BR>>REgards,<BR>>mani<CENTER><P><HR></p></CENTER><BR><!-- AnfangLinie --><!-- EndeLinie -->

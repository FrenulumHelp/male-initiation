<P>

<P>Hello,

<P>Im afraid I dont know the cause of your problem. It sounds so similar<BR>to many others I have read about and experienced myself.

<P>Im not a doctor . Im just a guy who is sharing my experience and<BR>hoping sometime to get a bit more light on these subjects. It seems<BR>such problems are a rarity, and the Urologists themselves often do not<BR>understand them - however you must try and ask a Urologist about this.<BR>- And then come back and tell me if he gives any pointers.

<P>I think you are saying that normally the pain used to go away after a<BR>few minutes but this time it hasnt, now it's always sore.

<P>If something feels sore then its best to treat it so, try and hold<BR>your testes lovingly rather than getting worried and frustrated, yes<BR>and rest is needed, so probably having no sexual activity is a good<BR>idea for a while, activity may only irritate the soreness.

<P>Sorry I cant help more, but its the blind leading the blind.

<P>You need to ask a Urologist and anyone else running an erectile<BR>dysfunction page. Good Luck

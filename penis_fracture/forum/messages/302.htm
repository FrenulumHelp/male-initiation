<P>M,

<P>My opening sulutation to all that come on here, is to say I'm sorry that you had to look for such a website, but I suppose in a world where this problem is a taboo subject and there's no one to really talk to, it's a Godsend!

<P>It definately sounds like you had a fracture, all those years ago. About the Viagra, I beleive you need to consult a doctor on this subject; Viagra reacts differently with different people. It's not a case of 'one size fits all'. I myself have never tried Viagra, I used Cialis and have read many times that Cialis is better than Viagra (it stays in the system longer). You need to do some research and find out what is best for you. No one on this forum (unless medically qualified) can say whether 100mg of Viagra is good for you. 

<P>Louis.

<P>>Im a 23yr old man. At the moment i would say that i do get erections. 8 years ago i had the case of penile fracture. I was masturbating a bent my penis under my leg a little just after i had ejaculated. So i hear a loud crack and the most intense pain i could imagine....testicles all swollen, erection gone down right away. The doctors told me the next day that it was a mild fracture which has left a blood clot or nodule which is here till today.<br>>I started getting erections again like 2 weeks after this strangely, but the problem seems to stand out today, as i do have erections but they don't last as long as they should unless i abstain from masturbating. Im thinking of trying 100 mg viagra because my performance anxiety is out of control and i already suffer from general anxiety anyone, would this be a good idea?<CENTER><P><HR></p></CENTER><input type=hidden name="followup" value="301,302"><input type=hidden name="origname" value="Louis"><input type=hidden name="origemail" value="louis-at-btinternet.com"><input type=hidden name="origsubject" value="Re: Haunted by old fracture"><input type=hidden name="origdate" value="06 May 2007 13:43:59"><input type=hidden name="subject" value="Re: Haunted by old fracture"><br><CENTER>

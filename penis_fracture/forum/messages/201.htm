<P>Thank you for responding. I feel that what you have said as helped me a great deal. I give respect to you and the other people who have posted here. Even if the problem/injury ends up not being a fracture at all, at least everybody had the courage to post something. <BR>As for incompetence, I think the knowledge you have is enough to help some of us. As you had stated, even the more severe cases are coming to light. <BR>As far as the links are concerned, I can't remember any right now, but Google is one of the better search engines to use. <BR><BR><!-- AnfangLinie --><CENTER><!-- Ende BeitragsNavigationsLeisteUnten --></CENTER><HR class=hrparsi></BLOCKQUOTE></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><CENTER><A HREF="../index.htm"><B>Back to Old </B>(edited)<B> Forum Index</B></A><BR><FONT SIZE="5"><A HREF="../../index.html#start">Atypical Fracture Index</A></FONT></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

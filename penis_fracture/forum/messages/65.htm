<P>Wow, I cant believe it. I found this sight again. Lets see... April, May, June, .. shit .. it has been 7 - 8 months.<BR>Anyway - I am committed to reporting any changes since my cock crash.

<P>First off: I have done some thinking and have sobered up some, yet unfortunatly I am still an opiate addict - which sucks.<BR>Anyway - this has happened to me before. Early on in my addiction I had a lot of sex for long periods of time with the wife. I mean my wife. Sometimes when I would start to lose an erection, and needed just a little penetration to get going again, I would grasp the base of my penis and squeeze hard enough to force blood towards the head witch would give me enough length and rigidity to start penetration. This would usually give me the need inspiration for another erection - and once again - off to the human races.<BR>Now while on the opiates like oxycontin, which is of course a painkiller, I probably wouldnt notice if I were getting too tight a grip and damageing something - LIKE MY PRECIOUS COCK!!!

<P>I think that is what I did rather than jam it - which I have done also and it was quite painful, lasting a day or two - but nothing lasting.

<P>The damage I caused, the damned damage, which brought me to this site, was caused by the above procedure - WHICH I DONT EVEN CONSIDER DOING ANYMORE OR EVER AGAIN.

<P>After 13 years of marriage my wife decided to try anal sex. She had also decided to try intravenous coke and smak too (prior to the anal sex of course).<BR>Our sex life was really wild for several months until see went crazy. Completely bonks. Paranoid, verbal hallucinations, etc. Thought I had extra wives and kids in attic, thought I was having sex over the Internet with our office people, and filed for divorce.<BR>I got her back and in a clinic..she was better after that but still has to take medication to stop the voices from screaming at her.

<P>Anyway, the night I did the damage was one of those times where I had held back my orgasm so long I couldn’t have one. She needed an orgasm badly having been riding the ridge for a couple of hours.<BR>So she is one her back on a desk. She has a huge dildo (that I don’t particularly like but still prefer it to the alternative) in her pussy and I am trying to re-enter her ass. I have been forced out now a couple times by that dammed huge rubber cock and this time I just don’t have the rigidity needed to enter that second, tighter, back up pussy, so I am feverously working my "technique" to very limited success. She is oblivious of my silent struggle to satisfy her, and just keeps telling me, put it in, put it in, put it in, put... like she is going to finally cum if I can just give her a few hard (competitive strokes)<BR>** This is really ironic. I am, of course, in control of my "competitor" and for the same reason I am trying like hell to re-enter her with my dick, I cannot remove the obstacle in her vagina that is making it all the more difficult.<BR>Anyway, I pull it off.<BR>Cheer everyone.<BR>With one final squeeze I am able to penetrate her anus, get a little movement, achieve an erection which last long enough to get her off (my damned desk) (just kidding)<BR>As is our usual ritual, when she comes before me, my beautiful considerate, spouse, takes the position to blow me off.<BR>Now usually I am bad need for this attention but this time I was just a little too sore... and getting more so.<BR>She was disappointed (God I love her) but got over it quickly, falling asleep with a Camel in her hands a couple minutes later.<BR>I put on my robe and went downstairs for something to eat. My cock felt unusually sensitivity - and not in a good way - against my robe.<BR>It seemed stuck between hard and soft but was probably swollen.

<P>BTW - all the following symptoms were the same as I posted ( I re-read them) before so I wont go over that again - or mention that poor cat which I never saw again.<BR>God I am a weird son of a bitch.<BR>Anyway, I abstained from intercourse for 2 months before I tried it again. I masturbated maybe once a week or even less.<BR>The drugs we are addicted to have begun to take their toll and rehab is a very close reality. My wife cannot have orgasms anymore because our tolerance to opiates is so high we just take too damned many to "think dirty".<BR>Plus, I am 40 fucking 8 years old. AT 48 I have gone about as far as I can with the dirty fantasy shit that I can and not blow my brains out the next morning because the 5 black bikers I invited over to help me get my wife off just wont fucking leave...<BR>Now this I have not done in reality, knowing from past experience with my ex turned prostitute, that reversing that little scene is as likely, and as appealing, as putting her Preparation H back in the tube....<BR>Now there are some stories that are off topic.. but will just add that I did have anal sex with her a few times but afterward, looking down and the shit and jism dripping off my dick, I had the feeling that I had just had sex with the wrong organ and felt really stupid.... kinda like I did when I was 17 with the dauchound, or the goat at 19... both mind you - unsuccessfully completed events that never less left me feeling very different afterwards than when the idea stuck me...

<P>Anyway - not much sex. Each time I do have intercourse I am still sensitive to the fact that I may re-injure myself. I get sore after 30 minutes and usually quit without orgasm - which I have lost the urge to have (except when jacking off - when that is the sole goal) now that the partner seemingly cannot have one until we get her cleaned up. She is only 41 and should not be slowing down. We have always both been the partner whose mission was to satisfy the other, prior to each other, so when the two of us got together we can fall into some scenarios of their own making - even if it is just watching TV with our shoes on all night eating ice cream and watching the history channel.

<P>Changes in my cock?<BR>Yes - For the Good: The bend(s) is gone for the most part all though the damage is visible on one side. The base of my penis it thicker than it once was with some hardness more on one side than the other. <BR>It does not hurt to have an erection but the skin feel tighter and I fear any aggressiveness due to both a real physical sensation and a psychological uneasiness.<BR>Orgasms, when I have them, are usually somewhat repressed and not too satisfying yet taking a leak afterwards for sometime feels real damned good. This is not entirely due to the damage and probably less due to the damage and more the drugs which have caused this bad - good tradeoff for some time (well since being a junkie). I can, however, have a good orgasm - a usually do if I have one during intercourse... in fact it is sometimes a little too intense..<BR>Overall - a much more subdued sex life. I can live with that only because I believe (we both do) that it will improve when we get clean.<BR>It still bums me out but not as after (due to the above)<BR>For the Bad: THE GODDAMNED UNIT IS SHORTER...AT LEAST A UNIT AND A HALF SHORTER (lets just say 20 -22 1/2% shorter). Erections feel as if most of the blood is in the base and the shaft.<BR>I will just say it.. When I was 21 I had occasions to measure my dick as did an occasional girlfriend. I would come out 7 1/2 maybe 8 if you pushed the ruler down into my pubic area just enough it didnt hurt. This was when I weighed 165 at 6'. One little seamstress once measured the girth which came to 5.5 inches.<BR>I weigh 200 now and typing this post is the most exercise I have gotten today. I eat three gallons of ice cream a week and maybe 2 dozen donuts. I do still get some exercise (when I purchase the pallets at Krispy Kream each weekend they give me 2 dozen dounuts). Yes I hand load them and probable load 200 a week from around town. BTW - I own a pallet recycling co.<BR>"I said the other day- half joking and hoping for some negative confirmation - I think my dick is getting shorter" She said, " yeah... I noticed" "I was just joking... - "I wasnt".. it is shorter and it still has that weird knot...<BR>Bitch...<BR>I measured it myself the other night while masturbating to some internet porn. Shit.. I barely topped... no made 6, and I was pushing the ruler down so hard it did hurt. I broke the ruler trying to get the girth... but I would guess I have gave up length for the offending hump slowly growing at the base of my shaft...<BR>Where does that end?<BR>Extrapolating the end game from what has occurred during the time so far - I will have nothing but an erection that resembles a softball sized lump in just a few short years.<BR>Maybe I wont seek rehab..<BR>Maybe it will stop when I reverse dimensions - a 5.5 inch dick with a circumference of 8!?!<BR>Sorry stumpy... maybe if you weren’t so old - and a junkie.<BR>A tear rolled off my nose and... completely missed my shrinking dick. The cat was no where to be found.

<P>Good Day<BR>Best to all..<BR>Only suggestion her is don’t give up the masturbation - fuck em..it is fantasy time so nothing really matters - plus exercise is always a good thing.<CENTER><P><HR></p></CENTER><BR><!-- AnfangLinie --><!-- EndeLinie -->

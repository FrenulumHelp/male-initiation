<P>Hi Gary,

<P>you do enjoy writing - dont you!

<P>its not peyronnies it happened suddenly, and  I believe you would be able to feel hard areas.

<P>I have never heard of bent penii becoming straight again ... so maybe you just have to learn some new acrobatics for your fun - maybe at certain angles, your wife will even prefer the new variation ...?

<P>see ya<BR>Rob 

<P><BR>>I agree with your statement (request) that posters try and continue posting their progress - even if things do get better - and your right - probably those who quit, got better.<BR>>I think I have improved. I have the odd feeling this has happened before.<BR>>Sorry about the long, long, post.<BR>>I havent felt any real pain - just a tightness that wasnt there before.

<P><BR>>I had been taking careful, since it seemed the majority opinion after 5 - 6 hours<BR>>Cruising websites to see just what happened (and surely I couldn’t be the only one).<BR>>Not a lot of real positive news posted or in print - from Doctor or patient.<BR>>Back to careful -<BR>>My wife and I had been checking the bend, etc. about once or twice a week. She was more worried than I was in the beginning (except the very beginning when only I noticed the problem during masturbation, did a quick search, and got my first knowledge from an article which describing Pyrenees (sp) stated, "no cure, progressively worsening, no sex, only hope was a surgical fillet, which sent you home without a piss shutoff switch and a future life with a (even) shorter dick - which was academic – since chances are you wouldn’t be getting it up anymore.<BR><BR><CENTER>

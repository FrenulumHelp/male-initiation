<P>I saw my 7th Doctor. He's pretty much the high priest of all Urology. He gave me an injection that's intended to cause a raging erection so that he can evaluate. I saw a bit of dissapointment in his face when he saw that the needle didn't create one. he told me to stimulate myself and left the room, after I did that i got the fraction of an erection that I get these days.

<P>He came back and proceeded to basically try to comfort me by telling me that eventually EVERYONE has an old man's dick. I could have cried right there, I've been this way since i was 21.

<P>then while he was talking to me I lost my hard on. which i figured was natural, but he said that with the injection he gave me I should have had an erection for the next 10 hours. In fact he had another injection he was supposed to use to counter the first, but he never had to.

<P>He performed ultra sounds on me, and told me tha twhile I do have scar tissue, it's not my problem. The blood flow into my penis is good enough. 

<P>The problem is that I'm leaking. my veins should trap the blood as it comes in, but it doesnt.

<P>and he said there's nothing he can do about it. He said that he can tell, by the fact that I do get a partial erection, that my leaking injuries will be to small to find. He can't find them and he can't fix them, and nothing can be done.

<P>He said that perhaps in 4 or 5 years with stem cells there will be a cure.

<P>I surely find no comfort in that. I've been so afraid that I was going to miss it. That this part of young life passion and love and even just lust would instead for me be spent in shame and pain.

<P>I've missed so much of it already, and it's now clear that I'm going to miss the rest.

<P>My father has me scheduled to try a myriad of alternative medicine things, things that sound ridiculous and fantastic. Magnets, and even lasers. 

<P>It sounds ridiculous to me, but I'm desperate.<BR><BR><CENTER>

<P>Hi there,

<P>I'd first off like to thank you for willingness to help people. It's good to see.

<P>Now I have a very unique problem. Since as long as I can remember, dating back from elementary school, I've felt a chronic sensation in my penis (24/7). It NEVER goes away. Now I will attempt to describe the feeling to the best of my ability:

<P>It's definately not pain. It's a mix of having to go to the bathroom, tickeling, and soreness maybe? I get more soreness (and numbness) after masturbation for some reason.

<P>I've been circumsized since birth and have speculated possible nerve damage. The location of the feeling is either in the bottom ("corpus spongosium") or the nerves surrounding the urethra itself.

<P>On a scale from 1 to 10, the discomfort is a 2, unless I masturbate or it's really hot (then it can go to a 4). But I think about it all the time as you can imagine, and it gets in the way of my life.

<P>Can you diagnose me? Any hunches? I do plan to take up the courage to find a urologist one of these days, but I could really use your help.

<P>-Thank you.<!-- Ende BeitragsNavigationsLeisteUnten --><HR class=hrparsi></BLOCKQUOTE></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><CENTER><A HREF="../index.htm"><B>Back to Old </B>(edited)<B> Forum Index</B></A><BR><FONT SIZE="5"><A HREF="../../index.html#start">Atypical Fracture Index</A></FONT></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

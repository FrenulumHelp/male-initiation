<P>>My penis got hurt during intercourse yesterday. I suppose underweight. Felt no pain afterwards but loss of sensitivity of penis. Will it come back over a couple of days?

<P>Hi Ty,

<P>Really cant say if the sensitivity will come back, or how long this might take, I would have thought this should be better overnight. Please read the emergency instructions which are about 4 or 5 threads under this one.    

<P>You cant lose anything and might gain a lot by going to a doctor, please do this.

<P>thanks

<P>today i was playing basktbll and took what felt like adirect front on hit to my penis.  The pain was intense, and immediate.  It was sharp localized stabbing pain that spread throughout the nether regions.  No trace of pain related to a testacle trauma.  I immediatly checked my penis which was fullly retracted and ashen white, with some discharge that looked and felt like semen.  I left the game and when i arrived home n penis had begun to swell below the head on the right top sied, curving the tip to the left.  I have iced it periodically since and the swelling and curvature have dereased.  Still some lingering dull pain, but i urinated and thre was no blood in it, although it did kind of hurt.<BR><BR><!-- AnfangLinie --><CENTER><HR></p></CENTER><!-- EndeLinie -->

<P>1st of all...great forum! It's quite informative and a good outlet on a delicate subject. Thanks!

<P>I am 58 and have had a heart attack several years ago. After stinting, I have had to take drugs to thin my blood, lower my blood pressure etc and they have caused some ED. Aftyer I became stable, my cardiologist recommended that I try the various meds available to sustain an erection and I did with varing results. I dont like the side effects (pounding head, stuffed sinuses,headache, tight chest) but I do like the erection. I'm active about 5-6 times a week.

<P>About 6-7 months ago, sometime after taking cialis, I was riding my Harley (yes, I got a hardon while riding the bike!) and hit a bump in the road that caused me to bang up against the tank. I didnt feel a sharp pain or hear any popping but it was locally painful at the time. Since then, I have a decided bend in my penis, about 30 degrees up) and erections are somewhat painful. I switched from briefs to boxers at the suggestion of someone but that didnt help. There was no resulting swelling or apparant bruising associated with the hit. The pain had been lessening but the bend has not. I have finally decided to go see a urologist about it but then came accross this forum. Do you have any other suggestions of what I can try?

<P>Im a 23yr old man. At the moment i would say that i do get erections. 8 years ago i had the case of penile fracture. I was masturbating a bent my penis under my leg a little just after i had ejaculated. So i hear a loud crack and the most intense pain i could imagine....testicles all swollen, erection gone down right away. The doctors told me the next day that it was a mild fracture which has left a blood clot or nodule which is here till today.

<P>I started getting erections again like 2 weeks after this strangely, but the problem seems to stand out today, as i do have erections but they don't last as long as they should unless i abstain from masturbating. Im thinking of trying 100 mg viagra because my performance anxiety is out of control and i already suffer from general anxiety anyone, would this be a good idea?<br><br><CENTER>

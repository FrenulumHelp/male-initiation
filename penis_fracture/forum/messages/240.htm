<P>As an answer to: <A HREF="234.htm">recent nerve trauma</A> written by c at 02 Dec 2006 00:34:09:

<P>Hi c,

<P>we really dont know the answers. 

<P>>After a heavy masturbation session, I accidentally bent my shaft for a few seconds.

<P>Both these are very typical causes for problems on this forum.

<P>Sometimes it heals with abstinence. Recently on this forum we have had a lot of men saying there is a loss of sensation, added to this as you say "nearly immposible to get an erection" ... I believe this might be your own body trying to tell you to give it a rest. Sometimes it seems this can mean several months abstinence.

<P>If you can feel a bit of tissue damage, then this must indicate something, but Im afaraid I dont know what - have the docs no idea?

<P>Please give things a rest for a while then come back and tell us if this works for you or not

<P>good luck<BR>Robin

<P>I include my normal footnote<BR>_______________________________________<BR>One optimistic thought is that at least we can contact each other these days with www.<BR>I often wonder how it was even 20 yrs. ago, left totally alone with this problem, - I think Id have gone crazy without www. Men with our problems must have been going crazy throughout the last centuries.

<P>Isolated and individual we will be as lost as the men pre interet - the chance we have today is as a group.

<P>This forum and home page are becoming a collection of evidence on penis trauma/atypical fracture. I feel our collective need is our only hope (or certainly our main hope) of getting this problem recognised, and researched.

<P>I wish others on the forum would come back and participate, everyone seems to want to go it alone or just give up ... and thats going to result in the same results that it has done for the last 1000 years : nothing.

<P>its no use asking doctors to look at just “me” - the medical world cant be blamed on this subject - they have to think practically - our problem occurs perhaps one in 5,000 - any individual doctor probably sees only one case in his life -

<P>So many of "us" have been to countless urologists for countless tests - and somehow we and the doctors are not getting results - so what are WE doing wrong that we could do better -

<P>please think how a group can change a situation which individually we will never change.

<P>Please contribute to this forum and talk with each other - dont just expect me to answer.

<P>If you disagree TELL ME WHAT OTHER ALTERNATIVE WE HAVE APART FROM A<BR>GROUP??!!

<P>I feel what we need is a student Urologist to answer letters on the forum. Students have time to research, and a last year student doing a special research on this subject would be ideal - they are always looking for new subjects to write diploma work.

<P>Im NOT online at home - I dont have the possibility to do internet research.<BR>Please leave links and comments on other www addresses<BR>which deal with these subjects - so that an index or network of<BR>relevant pages can be developed. (Someone recently left a link which<BR>enabled me to write to an online urology faculty asking if anyone can<BR>help)

<P>Id love someone to spend a couple of hours using their “worry” energy positively to google for medical universities (esp. Urology dept.) and collect 50 or even 10 e mail addresses, ... and then send out spam like invitations to help ...

<P><BR>>After a heavy masturbation session, I accidentally bent my shaft for a few seconds. Immediately there was swelling and loss of some sensation in the shaft and testes. I went to the emergency room and they said that it was not a fracture, just minor trauma, and that it will heal over time. However, I think it's worse than they think it is. <BR>>I feel like I have no control over my penis at all, and it is still numb and nearly immposible to get an erection. I can also feel a bit of tissue damage down the shaft. <BR>>Is this really something that can heal over time, or is the sensation gone once you lose it?<CENTER><P><HR></p></CENTER><INPUT type=hidden NAME="followup" VALUE="234,240"><INPUT type=hidden NAME="origname" VALUE="Robin"><INPUT type=hidden NAME="origsubject" VALUE="Re: recent nerve trauma"><INPUT type=hidden NAME="origdate" VALUE="07 Dec 2006 18:29:39"><INPUT type=hidden NAME="subject" VALUE="Re: recent nerve trauma"><BR><CENTER>

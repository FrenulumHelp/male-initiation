<P>Hi Stevo,

<P>The Urologist - excuse me but this is typical: Why is he looking for plaque? because he can only think of a peyronnies diagnosis, ... peyronnies is more common in older men: calcification of the penis ... I had two or three doctors who diagnosed this even thoguh there was no plaque.

<P>So a specialist - good - what is UCLA and anyway which land do you live in? - I asked before.

<P>I thought several things about you over the week - 

<P>What we are fairly sure of is that your pains will get less over time. We dont know how much they will lessen and how long it will take.

<P>In between time, till that happens, it strikes me, you just have to accept reality and get yer head screwed on. I often say: losing your head is far worse than losing your penis.

<P>I cant provide a miracle – I can only give little clues which may help you –

<P>A professional counsellor should be able to do this better than me, but what I really feel you must do is sit down and think out all the other things (apart from a penis) which make up being a man ...  

<P>I think there are 5 things which come to my mind and I want you to think about it.

<P>I suppose what almost hurts me is that you have a girl friend and my God you say you are in love, well for Gods sake hold her and love her and deepen that experience - WITHOUT SEX - 

<P>If you followed through my whole story (which I dont expect) but I have had erection problems throughout my life and when I was younger have often slept with women without sex, and it was a beautiful experience more fulfilling than a fuck ... 

<P>I just reckon for a time at least you have to develop the other parts of being a man - forget the pathetic little penis/ego 

<P>There was another book I read which would help you - David GILMORE "Manhood in the Making" (Yale University Press (1990),) this offers a wonderful perspective of primitive man, developing his attitudes/self image as provider and giver, caring for his extended family group – this book contradicts the sort of Freudian idea of the primitive selfish/penis/ego based male. You should read it, it would definately help your present situation!

<P>You have at least two weeks - and nothing better to do ... so I would personally really like you to take up at least ONE of my suggestions.

<P>How lucky you are! I was just alone for 4 years when my injury happened - I really believe everyone must go through this alone, or learn from each other, ... I hope you dont decide to go through it all alone, it would be such a waste.

<P>Thanks for your letter thanking me ... its just I wanna see positive results from my help. 

<P>OK? thanks

<P>cheers

<P>Robin

<P><BR>>The Urologist that i saw today felt me, and upon finding no plaque, told me he coudln't tell me why i had pain, and reffered me to aspecialist at UCLA.<BR>>I have in appointment in two weeks. I'll let you know.<CENTER><P><HR></p></CENTER><BR><!-- AnfangLinie --><!-- EndeLinie -->

<P>Hi E man,

<P>Dorsal vein trauma - I have seen this mentioned in the medical studies on MEDLINE (link on www.male-initiation.net/medicus.html and search for penis fracture dorsal vein - would probably work and then you will need the citation results).

<P>>I went to see the my GP a couple of days a go and she described it as a dorsal vein trauma which i will inevitably heal from, depending on how much sex i have during the healing.

<P>Your normal GP woman doctor, appears to know more about this subject than many urologists!!! I am quite amazed.

<P>You will probabyl regain 100% erection but really you shouldnt be even thinking about or experimenting with this right now.

<P>Sperm is not influenced by penis trauma/fracture.

<P>>I would like to add a little about my GPs note, she mentioned that penile fracture is a myth...and she advised me strongly against going on the net for information.

<P>Id like to know where she advises, if not the net, urologists had no idea of my complaint or that of many other men on this forum - penis fracture is not a myth otherwise there wouldnt be countless studies written on the subject in MEDLINE - and I never said you had a fracture - still I wont get angry at her - she seems to be about the only doctor who I have ever heard doing a good job in this area - lucky you.

<P>Please return and tell us when and how you are cured, and just anyway in a few weeks time, to tell us how progress is - thanks

<P>Robin

<P><BR>>Thank you for your reply robin, and your description of my injury is just like my GPs.<BR>>Dorsal Vein Injury<BR>>Symptoms of my injury is a lil bruise, no pain unless pressure is applied, no decoloration, no bendings, no bleedings, injured veins hurt a lil when pressure is applied.<BR>>I went to see the my GP a couple of days a go and she described it as a dorsal vein trauma which i will inevitably heal from, depending on how much sex i have during the healing.<BR>>What im worried about is whether i will still get my 100% errection sustaining after i heal. Lately, i am able to get an erection 90% but unable to sustain it, maybe due to anxiety, and possibly because of the veins healing and not allowing as much blood as usual. Is this natural? and will i retain my usual stiffness?<BR>>However, I noticed my erection is improving and judging from my sperm it does not look like it has been affected by my injury.<BR>>I would like to add a little about my GPs note, she mentioned that penile fracture is a myth...and she advised me strongly against going on the net for information.<BR><BR><BR><!-- AnfangLinie --><CENTER>

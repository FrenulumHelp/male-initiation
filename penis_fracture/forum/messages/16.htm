<P>...edited...

<P>different letters show<BR>- the pain diminishes leaving no sensitivity<BR>- difficulties by urinating<BR>- caused by sudden leg movement or hip movement, means it is connected to trapped nerve in this area, 

<P>... edited .... 

<P>bending is very common after penis fracture, one medical study <BR>suggesting that bent erections occurring in baby boys are <BR>caused by bumps in the womb during the almost permanent <BR>foetal erections.

<P>I hardly ever hear from men who have had this sort of experience 10 or 20 <BR>years ago. Does it usually cure spontaneously when given <BR>enough time,? (and no man complains about mere bending)? 

<P>...edited...

<P>I see no way to resolve OUR difficulty except to support this forum and become active - I have been active alone for <BR>7 years - then had to stop 3 yrs. ago, and Im still nervously exhausted. I cannot do this sort of work again, not for quite a while. 

<P>Please people TAKE RESPONSIBILITY for this forum Literally the only hope I see is as a group

<P>First and most important it needs cool calm and collected questions to any contributor, to bring out their<BR>experience, how it was caused, etc. IN DETAIL, - in all the embarrassing detail ... caused by experiments with vacuum cleaners, sheep, whatever, - teste, back, hip, groin, knee pain - the development over months, years, 

<P>It needs experiment with cures or alleviators, eg. accupuncture, homeopathy, and all the other new and old <BR>medicine forms which arent covered in traditional western medicine. Especially acupuncture seems worth trying, or hypnosis, both are used by dentists for similar pains.

<P>It needs MRI examinations but it seems these are useless <BR>unless you get doctors who are interested in researching <BR>the subject. What we have is very rare, practical normal <BR>doctors have no time for it, this is understandable - (Im not being cynical).<BR>Maybe the only way to find the solutions in traditional <BR>western medicine is writing to urology depts. and <BR>advertising for final year urology / andrology students who <BR>are looking for an original study subject,  

<P>Writing to other mens forums and advertising this forum, to <BR>get any histories. Maybe someone who used to have such <BR>problems has resolved them, how?

<P>a group of people must stimulate this forum - collect <BR>experiences  - - organise them -- they need to be <BR>analysed - retitled correctly for easy comparison -,and put <BR>in a system, and the present 20 well documented experiences <BR>need to be a 100 before patterns develop.<BR>1) those caused from sudden leg movement or sport, do they <BR>have similar results? 2) penis cracks and bleeding seem <BR>sometimes to heal by themselves, but? 3) nerve problems caused a) through bending b) through frontal punch or pressure - which causes which effects?  

<P>A moderator - coordinator could send me pages of organised experiences to put on the site. 

<P>Really, I have done all the basic research, and stood up in public on two themes, I have patiently answered, studied, <BR>cried in empathy about and sorted over a thousand letters. With circumcision I was able to find a number of original <BR>answers, but Im exhausted - I get no support - all the energy is out of me, ... the only thing which I want to do is rewrite clearly some parts of my online site - this does me good, it makes me solid - but I cant take this caring, responsible, regular daily being there for other people any more, ..it costs too much nerves and energy, ...(see my male-initiation.net/support.html if you want to help me). 

<P>My hope must be that someone else will now take over looking for the answers. - this responsibility is NOW EASY  to take anon. ON THIS FORUM - Contact me if you need my name to open up anything else. 

<P>take care<BR>Cheerio<BR>Robin Stuart<BR><BR><CENTER>

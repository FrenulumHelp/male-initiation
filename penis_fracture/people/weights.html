              <P>Robin-
                
              <P> I am 24yrs old and have had the same sexual partner for 4 years now.  Within the last 6 months I have experienced groin pain in my left side and is causing an aching in my left testicle.  I had been lifting weights 3-4 times a week, and have cut back with in the last couple months or so.  I saw a doctor 3 months ago and he said to wear jockey underwear all the time and stop heavy lifting.  He gave me an anti-inflamitory and said it was a high groin strain.  I have also have had erectile dysfuntion throughout this time as well, and my girlfriend and I have had very limited sex due to this problem.  I have been unable to sustain an erection if I have one as well. The pain becomes more persistance on long car rides and extending sitting time. Do you have any advise for me? Thanks.

              <P>Hi Gary,
                
              <P> thanks for writing. You have obviously been doing a bit of research<BR>
                yourself.
                
              <P> I dont know if theres anything helpful which I can add. - I have heard<BR>
                before of weight lifting causing pain in the testicles and penis. Why<BR>
                on earth does this effect some men and not others? - it seems you must<BR>
                take up a more flexible and gentle form of sport.
                
              <P> I am suprised about the jockey underwear, I dont quite understand but<BR>
                jockey underpants sound like they strap you up tight, and Id have<BR>
                thoguht it was far better to let the balls etc. hang freely.
                
              <P> Being unable to sustain an erection sounds like a problem with the<BR>
                blood flow, so I dont understand how this ties in to the general<BR>
                picture.
                
              <P> When you say sitting for long periods makes the pain stronger, then I<BR>
                am inclined to think it may be a problem with the base of your spine,<BR>
                I have heard of problems with the base of spine being the cause of<BR>
                pains in the testicle - a specialist I saw thought this was common.
                
              <P> On that basis I would suggest a good massage specific on the base of<BR>
                spine, using tiger balm or some other heat producing agent applied<BR>
                directly to the base of spine, and then maybe to do this lying on your<BR>
                right side, to relieve any pressure on the left ... and see if this<BR>
                has any effect.
                
              <P> I suppose when I combine this about your spine with your need for a<BR>
                gentle form of sport then you should take up tai chi or one of the<BR>
                other gentle Chinese sport methods.
                
              <P> You should go to a Urologist rather than a normal doctor, (Im suprised<BR>
                your doctor didnt refer you to one,)
                
              <P> Please tell me if ever you find out anything else about your<BR>
                condition, ... I am just another sufferer who believes in helping each<BR>
                other, and I know about 1% of the answers at present.
                
              <P> cheers

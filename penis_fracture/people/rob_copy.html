                http://www.male- initiation.net/library/anatomy/trauma.html <BR>
                the article start with "My own symptoms started as the direct result of <BR>
                excessively pulling backwards on the foreskin during erection" </P>
              <P>I hope that you have the email address of this guy, i need to talk to him to<BR>
                see if he found a solution to his problem.</P>

              <P>Hi xxxx.<BR>
                ... I am the guy you want to speak with - I suspect that now 2 months after your letter, the pains will be getting milder, (or might have vanished?) anyhow, tell me more about the causes and symptoms - </P>
              <P>hope everything is OK<BR>
                Robin </P>
              <P>Hi Robin<BR>
                I still have pain in the right side of my penis, at the base, i think that the pain is not deep, its Superficial, i saw around 8 urologists without any help, i was planning to get married this year and i stoped it because of the pain, i don't know what to do else. </P>
              <HR NOSHADE>
              <P>This young man jets around the world, and wanted me to ring him in Jerusalem then Singapor - He didnt read enough to realise it was my own story he was referring to and never told me anything of his own causes or symtoms ! - It is impossible to help others when i get no information - Please always give a detailed description of your own causes and symptoms - I cant be expected to invest more time and money helping rich people who dont even offer me any information !! - what a crazy world - </P></TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE>

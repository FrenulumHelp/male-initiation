              <P>I had surgery to correct a penis fracture on Dec. 13, 2003. My doctor told me I could resume having sex on Jan 19, 2004. I'm quite concerned with the results. The head of the penis seems bent down during sex with a resultant pain in the top side of the shaft just below the head (it hurts and feels like it may snap again there if it receives the wrong pressure.). The scar tissue along the incision line is a great problem. I can feel it balls of it under the skin and the scar line is tight and also hurts. The head of the penis seems like it doesn't get sufficiently hard during sex and it tingles. I feel like I get hard up to the scar line and not much above it.</P>
              <P>I'm greatly concerned! Who do I contact that knows? My surgeon doesn't seem very knowledgeable post surgery. I'd also like to find the few people who have this to hear of their experiences. <BR>
                Thank you for your help in this matter. </P>
              <P>_________________________________</P>
              <P>My opinion:</P>
              <P>The doctors advise going to the accident and emergency ... but only go if its bleeding, ... accident and emergency would be useless for nerve pains and atypical fracture. (funny idea really, try it, go and sit in the A and E dept. for 10 years). </P>
              <P> This letter about a bad surgeon is typical of the circumcision side of my project, in that if things work well, then afterwards the men usually want to just forget the whole thing. <BR>
                  <BR>
                The surgeons can presumably usually successfully stitch up a bleeding penis fracture otherwise I would have received more letters. </P>
              <P>We must question if and when spontaneous healing or stitching is appropriate - and until we are sure of the answers we must follow the official medical advice. </P></TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE>

              <P>During intercourse it slipped out and hit my tail bone. He instantly went limp and was crying in pain. A large purple bruise appeared at ther base of othe shaft and runs down between his testes, there was no blood and he was able to still maintain an erection and come later. But it is extremely sore and he is to embarassed to tell anyone.

              <P>Hi Valerie,
                
              <P> This is a fracture. Its now the 7th so we are already over the 48hrs. emergency procedure - about 20 medical studies say that one must go and get immediate surgery for penis fracture - about 2 studies talk about conservative treatment --- the point is that blood congeals and often will heal by itself, the argument is that in minor fractures its better to leave alone ...
                
              <P> A large purple bruise appeared, so this indicates internal bleeding. Then you say he was able to maintain erection and come later, so I presume this has healed by itself, naturally it will be sore for a couple of days, and a very sensible idea is abstinence from any gymnastics for a few days to let it heal. If there is no problem with maintaining erection then we can hope its healed by itself.
                
              <P> You have had luck
                
              <P> Rob</TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE>

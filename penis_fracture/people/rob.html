              <P><A NAME="questionnaire"></A> <STRONG>Questionnaire</STRONG></P>
              <P>Name, initials, or code name? - Robin  Stuart</P>
              <P>Summarise type of injury in 3-5 words - one sided pain </P>
              <P>How was your injury caused? Did you bend or knock or over exert your  erection? <BR>
                One and a half months after operation to  remove frenulum breve at age 43, erection was bigger than previously. Pulling back foreskin to examine scarring  (phimotic ring) on inside of foreskin &ndash; sounds stupid but I held foreskin  stretched back for around 3 minutes examining myself with magnifying glass etc.... thus pressing erect penis back into groin/pubic bone. </P>
              <P>How long ago was the injury? &ndash; 12 years</P>
              <P>What symptoms? Pain or numbness? <BR>
                Intense pain for first 6 months &ndash;  gradually becoming less painful &ndash; now often a dull pain with occasional sharp  stabs &ndash; loss of erection &ndash; walking is often painful at top of right leg</P>
              <P>Where exactly is the pain or numbness? <BR>
                To start with it was just toothache like  pain and I couldnt identify where it came from &ndash; now I feel pain centres just  behind right top of pubic bone - then travels along right side of penis and  down rt. inside leg also rt. teste is very tender</P>
              <P>Bending? (is bend to same side or opposite  side as injury?)<BR>
                bending 10 degrees left, pain on right  side.</P>
              <P>Have you seen - how many doctors? &ndash; did  they help? &ndash; has anything helped?<BR>
                14 mostly urologists &ndash; they didnt help &ndash;  Lying on my back with knees bent takes pressure off the painful area - anaesthetic cream turned the sharp pain to a dull pain . </P>
              <P>How old are you? And which country do you  live in? (these influence medical care) -<BR>
                55 Germany<BR>
                ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
                <STRONG>Full Report </STRONG></P>
              <P>My own symptoms started as the direct result of excessively pulling backwards on the foreskin and holding it back during a larger than normal erection. This pushed the erect penis back into the groin/pubic bone. (I had examined the nature of a mild phimotic ring with magnifying glass). When pulling the foreskin forwards again an extremely sharp pain shot through the right side of the erect penis. </P>
              <P>I must have held the foreskin back for around 3-5 minutes  - also in the first period after my circumcision related operation, my erection was at least one and a half centimetre longer and more &quot;vibrant&quot; - fuller - electric - than I had previously experienced ... I was 43 years old when this happened.</P>
              <P>When I let the foreskin forward again, at first I thought that I must have trapped a bit of glass between foreskin and glans ... it was unbearable. After a month or two, though the pain was milder, the erection bent to the left, pain in right testicle, and pains in the right groin. </P>
              <P>Erections are half strong and occasional, this is understandable because the &quot;venous leakage&quot; is down to 20. Normally it should be 40, so this means half the blood needed stays in the erection. Erections or sex are mildly painful, but so is walking and sitting and everything.</P>
              <P>After maybe around 5 years, there are basically 2 sorts of pain, dull background aches and occasional sharp toothache like sensations. </P>
              <P>The base of the penis (right side) hurts around the joint of the inner thigh bone, behind the pubic bone, the thigh joint itself feels tender - &quot;about to fall off&quot;. Every day I am aware of the ache in the right testicle. The centre of the problem seems to be about 2 cm. behind the pubic bone and about 5 cm. higher than the perineum, it feels like a spot radiating out pain.</P>
              <P>The typical bulging of a hernia developed in the left groin (eg. when I cough) but on the right side (where it hurts) there is no bulging, - is my body reacting with general tension and tightness (as a form of self anaesthetic) on the right side and thus inhibiting the hernia?. </P>
              <P>Sharp stabs of pain are often experienced by walking - but can also be during turning over at night, or simply lifting the right leg. The stabs shoot like toothache between groin and knee, groin and hip. </P>
              <P>During masturbation there is often a pain along the right side of the penis, quite a distinct line of pain at 9 o'clock. During and after masturbation, there is sometimes a very clear trickling beating sensation in the right side of the groin area down to the testicle, (must be the semen canal or ?), ... very unpleasant. </P>

              <P><B>After 7 yrs.</B><BR>
                At the end of my cavernosography and MRI tests etc. and urologists who did not know anything - a very nice and even personally friendly professor in the Berlin Charitee - who treated me respectfully, as human, believed me etc. and then he examined me and on sqeezing the painful ball and me squealing in agony -- he said "the problem is a nerve trapped in  your hip or back" .... and then to proove his diagnosis he said "Look!" and went to squeeze my ball AGAIN!! - I knocked his hand away with my knee and froze my legs together</P>
              <P> Then theres a long story while Im getting more MRIs on hips and back and etc. and etc, and it gets very boring and showed nothing. 
                
              <P>____________________________________________________________</P>
              <P><B>Notes:</B><BR>
                I remember that as youth once every 100 or maybe 1000 times I would get a mild <BR>
                but quite precise pain along the right side of the erection - in the same place where I later had the nerve trauma. -- anyone else remember any forewarnings? </P>
              <P>I suspect such mild one minute long pains are very common, but no man talks about them, for fear of other mens laughter and the impression it would create for women. And probably self doubt that its psychosomatic.</P>
              <P><B>After 10 yrs.</B><BR>
                For me at present, after 10 years my own problem in the anatomical sense is occasional erection (not really solid) first thing mornings, still mild pain by masturbation, sometimes sharper stabs, but they dont last long, mostly often just a bruised feeling, when I think, I spose Ive got used to it all,  - Ive given up,  -  the leg joint is sometimes still bruised and the nerve groin to knee is still occasionally like an electric shock, but mostly I walk with small steps and dont go too far and so its ok - Ive got used to it and adapted. </P>
              <P><B>After 14 yrs. </B><BR>
                My libido seems to have gone to sleep - practically no sexual desire - (I'm 56 now and it seems rather young to have lost interest) - I presume this is because of the pain and so works like aversion therapy  ... this  makes sexual things easier but lack of libido also results in depression - so there is no real interest in anything, ... I often feel exhausted. 
                
              <P>I recently went to another therapist ... seeking help with pain therapy or any ideas to cope with my situation ... he suggested I was obsessed with my penis ... and wanted to analyse my parents! ... (My parents did nothing out of the ordinary, - except that my Mum gave me a strong sense of honesty and following my conscience.)
                
              <P>Also, I realise there is sure to be something psychosomatic after 14 yrs. - trouble is or seems to be that no therapist who is willing to believe my story and give me therapy for all the other bad therapists and doctors! 
                
              <P>Individually its not the doctors or psychologists fault, - these doctors have spent 7-10 years studying everything to get qualified and now they naturally think they have learned everything ... My history of phimosis, confuses them even more. -- So its the same know it all egoism one finds in almost every walk of life ... (Maybe this seems arrogant or sarcastic, but mainly its a comment on the world in general - and why should I be more angry than the starving kids in Africa?).
                
              <P>The doctors and psychologists think phimosis is a simple problem which no-one should worry about and is easily cured - they have never learnt that phimosis has hundreds of different forms and some of them are simply not easy to recognise. (See <A HREF="../../map.html" TARGET="_blank">Male Initiation and the Phimosis Taboos</A> -at <A HREF="../../index.html" TARGET="_blank">http://www.male-initiation.net/</A> )
              <P>Both these male problems have been tabood for centuries - men simply havent talked about them ... thats why I see both as a problem of male initiation, (i.e. how the previous generation and the culture prepares their young boys for manhood). 
                
              <P>With all the other tests of bravery in male intitiation process, it was probably against the credo of most primitive cultures for the males to complain about genital problems. So, even the normal male cannot be blamed, its just life, but in this modern world I credit myself at least with having the bravery to have talked. 
                
              <P>I hope - (now the main hope I have in my life)- I hope that at least my experience and talking about it on internet will make the world a better happier place for future generations and future relationships ...              
              <P>______________________              
              <P>The first summary i wrote - probably reroduces much of the above               
              <P><B>causes and symptoms<BR>
                one sided trauma through frontal pressure </B>
              <P>My own symptoms started as the direct result of excessively pulling backwards on the foreskin and holding it back during a larger than normal erection. (I had examined with magnifying glass and my finger nail (guitarists often have long finger nails) the nature of a mild phimotic ring). When pulling the foreskin forwards again an extremely sharp pain shot through the right side of the erect penis. </P>
              <P>I must have held the foreskin back for at least 3 minutes and probably 5 minutes - also in the first period after my circumcision related operation my erection was at least one and a half centimeter larger and more vibrant than I had previously experienced - I was 43 years old when it happened.</P>
              <P>At first I thought that I must have trapped a bit of glass between foreskin and glans ... the first week was unbearable. After a month or two, though the pain was milder, bending of the erection to the left, pain in right testicle, and then pains in the right groin. </P>
              <P>After maybe around 5 years the typical bulging of a hernia developed in the left groin (eg. when I cough) but on the right side (where it hurts) there is no bulging. Sharp stabs of pain are often experienced by walking and cycling (however cycling is mostly possible with presure on just the left leg!).</P>
              <P>Erections are half strong and occasional. The base of the penis (right side) hurts often during sex or afterwards. After masturbation, there is sometimes a very clear trickling sensation in the right side of the groin area, (must be the semen canal or ?), ... </P>
              <P>The right teste is very sensitive and sometimes very painful.</P>
              <P>Why did the groin start reacting within days of the &quot;penis fracture&quot;? - Doctors say there is no relationship, . . . even though the position of both complaints is less than an inch apart. </P>

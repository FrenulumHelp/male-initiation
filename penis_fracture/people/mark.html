                  <B>penile trauma, partner on top moved quick, pain near tip, not one sided </B> <BR>
  </P>
              <P>Written by Mark at 26 Jul 2000 04:43:59: </P>
              <P> Please help me anyone!!<BR>
                I am 30 years old. About 3 months ago I had sex with my girlfriend on top. Suddenly when I was not expecting her to move and when my penis was not quite erect she moved very hard and fast!! And I felt a rather sharp pain in my penis (closer the end of the penis). I was able to continue to have sex with her but it was quite uncomfortable and rather painful. There was no signs (bruising or bleeding or cracking sound) Just pain. After few days we had sex again but this time I finished fast because of the uncomfortable feeling near the tip (the end) of my penis. I am no longer sexually active because my girlfriend is away for the next 2 months. But after I masturbate pain increases a bit. 
                
              <P> I went to see two doctors and the urologist. I was told that I had nothing to<BR>
                worry about. Some trauma: I have tore, pulled, or rapture something inside, and that &ldquo;it will heal when it will heal.&rdquo; And I got no prescription nor treatment for this trauma. 
                
              <P> So far the pain is not very sharp but it is extremely annoying and I feel it <BR>
                ALL THE TIME. I take codeine sometimes to reduce the pain. I find it difficult to concentrate at work because the pain gets annoying. It feels like a pinching or cutting sensation. 
                
              <P> I have three questions: 
                
              <P> 1. When will it heal?<BR>
                2. Is ultrasound or laser treatment or some anti inflammation cream an effective treatment?<BR>
                3. Is it possible that I have dammed or ripped a nerve instead? 
                
              <P> Please, help anyone!! I am loosing my mind because of this constant pain. <BR>
                Besides I am worried that my girlfriend will be disappointed when I tell<BR>
                her that I am sore after sex. 
                
              <P> Thank you very much. Mark.

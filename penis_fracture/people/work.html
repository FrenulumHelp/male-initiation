              <P>My penis has been wierd for the last week, I have no problem getting an erection, but its numb and when I masturbate/have sex, it feels very intense and I ejaculate quick, plus when I do it feels like my penis is going to explode.
                
              <P> Before this happened, I did some intense yard work, and then masturbated, I dont know what is wrong with me, and I'm scared that its never going to heal.
                
              <P> Has anybody ever had anything like this?

              <P>Hi Rob,
                
              <P> I advise abstinence for a while. But before I start I want to say I know nothing - I am guessing and have no professional knowledge and you need to see a doctor, but
                
              <P> Yes I believe other men have had this ... namely, I have fairly often heard of muscle strain in the lower back after physical exertion ... there was an entry on this forum but I cant remember where (on the home page which is more organised - one entry is weight lifting causes atypical fracture - the guy there was in pain - I guess numbness is also a nerve reaction ) it says: a situation which is recognised among experts: as a result of muscular strain, a nerve trapped in the lower spine or hip can lead to one sided pain in the penis - experts will often perform an MRI and then give electro treatment.
                
              <P> Now please see a doctor (an urologist) and please come back and tell us what he says and does
                
              <P> thanks for the letter 
                
              <P> cheers<BR>
                Robin

              <P>Hi. Thank you for your reply, I went to a normal Doctor and he found nothing wrong (Said take it easy, and that I overdid things) But I figure I'll wait one more week and then go to a urologist.</TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE>

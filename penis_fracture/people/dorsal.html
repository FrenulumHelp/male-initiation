              <P>Penile fracture? After I came.....comes a bruise </P>
              <P>Hello,<BR>
                I hope this is where i can get the best info about my situation,<BR>
                I had a accident during sex, specifically cumming off. I cum'ed very intensely when my penis was really really hard (big pressure). I felt a moderate pain/bruise (mild if it happened somewhere else), and it appears to be bruising a lil wif veins being like popped, no decoloration, bleeding, etc.
                
              <P> It has been 2 days since the incident, and i cant get a hard erection ongoing, it will go flaccid then after a while hard again, the bruise seems to bother less. I check if i was able to have another sexual intercourse but kinda failed misserablely, but i still came, with mild discomforts(almost ignorable)
                
              <P> Wat im worried about is this a penile fracture?, will i heel from itself? wat is the best thing to do basically? any help is appreciated.<BR>

              <P> Hi E.Man,<BR>
                This probably is the best place for info. and if so it is proof that the medical world is in a sorry state with this sort of question.
                
              <P> I really know nothing, except from the emails etc. I get, I answer this forum freely, please dont complain if you dont like what I say.
                
              <P> What you describe is typical for this forum, an overbig erection strain, ... this is not penis fracture, but it is some sort of injury/trauma - atypical penis fracture ... and what YOU MUST do is take a complete rest from sex for a couple of weeks ... you describe a bruise or a strain ... imagine your foot bruising or being strained, if you carry on exercising it then it will never get better, you must rest it.
                
              <P> ...edited... 
                
              <P> Cheers<BR>

              <P>Thank you for your reply robin, and your description of my injury is just like my GPs.
                
              <P> <B>Dorsal Vein Injury<BR>
                Symptoms of my injury is a lil bruise, no pain unless pressure is applied, no decoloration, no bendings, no bleedings, injured veins hurt a lil when pressure is applied.</B>
              <P><B> I went to see the my GP a couple of days a go and she described it as a dorsal vein trauma which i will inevitably heal from, depending on how much sex i have during the healing.</B>
              <P> What im worried about is whether i will still get my 100% errection sustaining after i heal. Lately, i am able to get an erection 90% but unable to sustain it, maybe due to anxiety, and possibly because of the veins healing and not allowing as much blood as usual. Is this natural? and will i retain my usual stiffness?
                
              <P> However, I noticed my erection is improving and judging from my sperm it does not look like it has been affected by my injury.
                
              <P> I would like to add a little about my GPs note, she mentioned that penile fracture is a myth...and she advised me strongly against going on the net for information.

              <P>Hi E man,
                
              <P> Dorsal vein trauma - I have seen this mentioned in the medical studies on MEDLINE (link on www.male-initiation.net/medicus.html and search for penis fracture dorsal vein - would probably work and then you will need the citation results).
                
              <P> >I went to see the my GP a couple of days a go and she described it as a dorsal vein trauma which i will inevitably heal from, depending on how much sex i have during the healing.
                
              <P> Your normal GP woman doctor, appears to know more about this subject than many urologists!!! I am quite amazed.
                
              <P> You will probably regain 100% erection but really you shouldnt be even thinking about or experimenting with this right now.
                
              <P> Sperm is not influenced by penis trauma/fracture.
                
              <P> >I would like to add a little about my GPs note, she mentioned that penile fracture is a myth...and she advised me strongly against going on the net for information.
                
              <P> Id like to know where she advises, if not the net, urologists had no idea of my complaint or that of many other men on this forum - penis fracture is not a myth otherwise there wouldnt be countless studies written on the subject in MEDLINE - and I never said you had a fracture - still I wont get angry at her - she seems to be about the only doctor who I have ever heard doing a good job in this area - lucky you.
                
              <P> Please return and tell us when and how you are cured, and just anyway in a few weeks time, to tell us how progress is - thanks

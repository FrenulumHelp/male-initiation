              <P>Name, initials, or code name? -<BR>
                m<BR>
                Summarise type of injury in 4-5 words -<BR>
                bending to left, no sensitivity<BR>
                How was your injury caused? - Did you bend or knock or over exert your erection?<BR>
                suspect that trauma happened during intercourse, but their was no pain or bleeding as is common with  regular fractures
                
              <P> How long ago was the injury? -<BR>
                approx. 1 year
                
              <P> What symptoms? Pain or numbness?<BR>
                mild neurological 'referred' pain in perineum area (and sometimes in pelvis), but main concern is absence of sensitivity/numbness. erections can be achieved through manual stimulation but there is no feeling, indicating neurological symptoms
                
              <P> Where exactly is the pain or numbness?<BR>
                numbness is all along the shaft of penis. the pain is mainly in the perineum area, worsens when sitting down
                
              <P> Bending? (is bend to same side or opposite side as injury?) -<BR>
                15 degree bend to the left when erect (injury seems to be on top of the penis and toward the right, but nothing has been confirmed. doctors haven't found any disting bruising, nodules or plaques)
                
              <P> Have you seen - how many doctors? &ndash;<BR>
                have seen a few doctors; 2 urologists and an andrologist
                
              <P> How old are you? And which country? (these influence medical care) -<BR>
                20, england. have no private medical insurance so rely mainly on the NHS

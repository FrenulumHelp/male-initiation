          male circumcision. Most of the literature shows no awareness 
          of phimosis - its frequency - or the sexual and erectile problems which can be cured by circumcision. If routine circumcision 
          had been introduced for this most obvious reason of eliminating difficult 
          foreskins; then the importance of an alternative modern method, suitable to our culture's attitudes in this day and age, would be clear. </FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                                &quot;Das Kind&quot; by Ploss was first published in 1876, it was 
                              reissued in 1882-84 and Ploss died in 1885. In 1912, Renz revised 
                              his work. Since then the updated version from Renz has been frequently 
                              reissued, - 
                              meanwhile the original version from Ploss went out of print. Bryk, 
                              Jensen <A HREF="../library/xtras/refs.html#ref43">(43)</A>, Weiss <A HREF="../library/xtras/refs.html#ref95">(95)</A>, 
                              and apparently every modern researcher who refers to Ploss have 
                              used only Renz`s revised version with Renz`s interpretation for their research. (Please, never do with my work what Renz did to Ploss!)</P>
                              <P>After a year 
                                long wait, a rare 1884 edition of the original Ploss, (pages crisp 
                                with age, held in form with elastic bands), eventually arrived from 
                                G&ouml;ttingen.</P>

                                Ploss's German is that of a rather boring 
                                repetative rambling 19th. century anthropologist, I have split his 
                                very long paragraphs into intelligable parts. Otherwise I have kept 
                                to the exact original meaning - in preference to good English - and 
                                the text has been rigorously checked by native German speakers. 
                                Paragraphs 3 and 4 are the center piece ... in the rest he refers to 
                                the Jews or Muslims.</P>

                                An hygienic intention is never clearly expressed in the Jewish religious 
                                texts; and if one wishes to see the procedure as a hygienic measure, 
                                then such an understanding lay far from that of Abraham, Moses, Joshua 
                                or any of the other Prophets. When &quot;purification&quot; is spoken 
                                about in this context, one wishes merely to indicate an aspect of worship 
                                and cleaning from sins. Trusen said quite correctly: &quot;To consider 
                                circumcision as a prevention against illness is contrary to the Bible 
                                texts, wherein such a reason is not mentioned.&quot; (<I>J.P. Trusen, 
                                  die Sitten, Gebr&auml;uche und Krankh. der Alten Hebr&auml;er Breslau 
                                  1853</I>). Circumcision was however conducted as an act of purification 
                                among the Jews, as it was as well by other oriental peoples. e.g. the 
                                Egyptians; (<I>1. B. Moses 12. Cap. 12. 14. 15.</I>) in addition circumcision 
                                among the Arabs is called tuh&ucirc;r, tahir, i.e. Purification.</P>
                              <P>Nevertheless, in disagreement with this, as I believe, were those 
                                who introduced circumcision among the Hebrew people (should this have 
                                been Abraham, as in the legend, or whoever else it may have been); 
                                they held the idea that during coitus the circumcised condition made 
                                fertilisation more successful, then it is written in the Bible: &quot;through 
                                circumcision God gave him the prospect of plentiful descendants.&quot;</P>
                              <P>P. 367-370<BR>
                                Paragraph 1<BR>
                                There has been a great deal of argument concerning the origin and purpose 
                                of circumcision among boys. In the great majority of cases circumcision 
                                has been understood as a sanitary measure. In this respect, one cannot 
                                contradict that the lack of the foreskin; (if this is the result of 
                                either a congenital malformation, a chance injury, or if it has been 
                                purposefully removed); has far more advantages than disadvantages (<I>Prof. 
                                  Pitha in Virchow's Handb. der speciellen Pathol. und Therapie. VI. 
                                  2. Ab Erlangen 1856-1865 S.4</I>) in that on the one hand the high 
                                sensitivity of the glans, on the other the susceptibility to injuries 
                                and infections would be removed.</P>
                              <P>The cleaning of the surface of the glans becomes easier, the collection 
                                and decomposition of fungal mould (Smegma) is hindered, gonorrhoea 
                                is avoided and sores (namely Syphilis) are less likely to find footing. 
                                For this reason some doctors are of the opinion &quot;that the weighing 
                                up of all these advantages and disadvantages in those times could have 
                                been the sole reason for introducing circumcision, and that therefore 
                                the practice was justified in the orient and in all hot lands where 
                                the men really have an extended foreskin&quot; (<I>Prof. Podrazki in 
                                  Billroth's und Pitha's Handb. der Chirurgie. Krankh. d. Penis S.6.</I>). 
                                (For these reasons, a variety of people have requested the general 
                                introduction of circumcision from the National Health: (<I>Dr. Clapar&egrave;de, 
                                  La circoncision et son importance dans la famille et dans l'&eacute;tat.

                              <P>Paragraph 2<BR>
                                Against this view, (as I have already mentioned), I must again raise 
                                the point, that only in few cases were precautionary health measures 
                                openly expressed, or otherwise came to light as the definite and true 
                                intention behind the introduction and practice of circumcision; in 
                                that only among individual peoples e.g. the Samoaner, sanitary considerations, 
                                encouragement of cleanliness etc., were expressly emphasised (<I>Pritchard, 
                                  Mem. read before the Anthrop. Soc. I S. 326</I>)</P>
                              <P>An extraordinary large number of peoples who practice circumcision, 
                                show in fact little passion for cleanliness and it is therefore hardly 
                                likely that as an exception, they wished specifically the man's penis 
                                to be particularly clean. There must be another psychological motive 
                                which moved them to adopt the operation.</P>
                              <P>Paragraph 3<BR>
                                The purpose and intention of this operation lies, in my opinion, in 
                                the endeavour to correct nature. To help her with her supposed &quot;mistakes&quot; 
                                and to bring about a state on the sexual organ which one considers 
                                to be normal in adults. Such a state clearly never occurs of its own 
                                accord when left to nature among small children, and still does not 
                                develop spontaneously very often during puberty. On the other hand, 
                                it is not at all uncommon for such states to continue until adulthood 
                                causing difficulties during sexual activity. They wanted to eliminate 
                                phimosis, because they considered a man with such a defect was less 
                                able to have children.</P>
                              <P>In order to understand this it must be pointed out which process 
                                of change usually, if not always, occurs in the penis up until the 
                                time when procreation is possible. Among new born children, the foreskin 
                                covering the glans is always so formed that it is only with difficulty 
                                or force that it can be retracted over the glans. After a period of 
                                time in relationship to the development of the entire member, (the 
                                penis), the foreskin becomes a lot more elastic around its opening, 
                                so that later, in fact when the penis is in the erect state, in the 
                                majority of cases the foreskin folds back automatically.</P>
                              <P>It is thus quite normal for a new born child to possess a phimosis 
                                i.e. an elongation of the foreskin combined with a narrowness of the 
                                opening, such that the retraction of this behind the corona of the 
                                glans (which is profitable for a man in order to ejaculate when performing 
                                coitus); is not possible.</P>
                              <P>If everywhere and without any question (even among the insufficiently 
                                and inadequately observant natural peoples); the fact had been noticed 
                                that not uncommonly youths, as they develop to adulthood, may begin 
                                to carry the glans naked (because the prepuce retracts automatically 
                                and remains behind the corona); and in addition among men, the glans 
                                is still only abnormally covered by the foreskin during an erection; 
                                therefore the foreskin covering the glans appears to be an abnormal 
                                state of affairs, which one must quite routinely take counter measures 
                                against and correct in good time.</P>
                              <P>Paragraph 4<BR>
                                With this, I conclude that the original predisposition towards circumcision 
                                was the operational preparation for the sexual function of the man. 
                                One considers the child's foreskin, which has to some extent remained 
                                covering the glans, since earliest childhood regardless of everything, 
                                the persisting narrow condition of the phimosis; as being more or less 
                                an obstacle to coitus, which one must correct with a surgical operation.</P>
                              <P>It is for this reason, that most primitive peoples incise or ablate 
                                the foreskin, once the age of puberty, (when the maturity for the enjoyment 
                                of sex) has been reached: with this one decisive act they wanted to 
                                make the boy completely mature and normal in the sexual sense.</P>
                              <P>It is thus, an act which is conducted, whereby one takes the young 
                                person in as an equal among the group of mature, marryable men; and 
                                at the same time one combines this act with certain ceremonies, symbolic 
                                of this initiation; by which, with respect to the pain (that this forthcoming 
                                operation causes to the very sensitive male sexual organ), one wishes 
                                to develop a form of test on the masculine fortitude.</P>
                              <P>This singular operation which prepares for sexual adulthood, is 
                                practised by the Jews and Muslims among others, at quite an early age; 
                                here one believes it is necessary to fight against this natural state 
                                of incompleteness as soon as the child is born.</P>
                              <P>They want even the child to be assured the possibility of numerous 
                                offspring and not leave it to chance, if the phimosis which had been 
                                noticed on him, (which could perhaps hinder procreation); will resolve 
                                naturally by itself or if it will remain in the future. Thus it becomes 
                                regarded as a work which is pleasing to God: then it was held in itself 
                                by the Jews for highly worthwhile to have numerous offspring.</P>
                              <P>Paragraph 5<BR>
                                So we can assume then with great possibility, that the religious lawgiver 
                                among the Jews; (whether he introduced the practice from outside or 
                                found it already in existence); held the practice for useful and worthwhile 
                                and sought to anchor it for political-religious reasons, by consecrating 
                                it as a religious ritual commanded by God.</P>
                              <P>We will however not deny, that the practice in addition was also 
                                perhaps considered as hygienically useful. The first priority for the 
                                lawgiver was certainly the sexual potency of the nation, and (looking 
                                at it from) a religious perspective they honoured this act, (which 
                                guaranteed this potency already among the youth population for the 
                                years of adulthood), as a measure which led to the well being of the 
                                people, by pronouncing it a holy act. Among some peoples e.g. in America, 
                                the measure gained in addition the meaning of a blood sacrifice. Among 
                                others e.g. the Egyptians the Jews, the Monbuttu, many Melanesier etc. 
                                the meaning of a symbol of personal dignity, worth value, and &quot;uncircumcised&quot; 
                                for the Muslim, as also in South Australia, is regarded as a swear 
                                word.</P>
                              <P>P. 371-372<BR>
                                In Gen. 17 God commanded Abraham to introduce circumcision, and promised 
                                in return plentiful offspring ... when it says &quot;God commanded 
                                Abraham&quot; I find in this simply, that Abraham considered the introduction 
                                as a work which would please God ... Obviously he was of the opinion 
                                that circumcision was a means to producing a great number of offspring 
                                i.e. that it encouraged fertility.</P></TD>

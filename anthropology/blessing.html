          male circumcision. Most of the literature shows no awareness 
          of phimosis - its frequency - or the sexual and erectile problems which can be cured by circumcision. If routine circumcision 
          had been introduced for this most obvious reason of eliminating difficult 
          foreskins; then the importance of an alternative modern method, suitable to our culture's attitudes in this day and age, would be clear. </FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P>There is one discussion about if circumcision is a blessing or a 
                                mutilation. Many men have personal experiences which witness BOTH as 
                                true. Though routine circumcision may be seen as a great ignorance 
                                from the viewpoint of modern medicine, the idea that it was introduced 
                                for the purpose of mutilating young boys is a ridiculous one. </P>
                              <P>When the tradition became associated with <A HREF="sacrifice.html#start">sacrifice</A> or severe initiations rituals it could easily take on forms which 
                                from our cultural perspective are seen as a mutilation. On the other 
                                hand when the tradition became mixed with religious attitudes it 
                                would get the cultural stamp of approval as a blessing. Among the 
                                Jews and Muslims, circumcision is a work which is pleasing to God. 
                                The following passages are taken from <A HREF="../library/xtras/refs.html#ref31">Maurice Bloch's book &quot;From 
                                  Blessing to Violence&quot; (1986)</A>. It is a book devoted to describing 
                                and explaining the circumcision ritual among the Merina of Madagascar. 
                              <P>&quot;The most common answer I received to the question of why 
                                people practice circumcision was quite simply that circumcision is 
                                a blessing, a tsodrano. At first sight this has nothing to do with 
                                the practice itself, and so for a long time I ignored its significance, 
                                thinking it little more than a pious generality . . . However, it 
                                is clear to me now that this is indeed a very direct and profound 
                                explanation and one that should have led me to the central characteristics 
                                of the ritual.&quot; <A HREF="../library/xtras/refs.html#ref31">(p. 
                                  49)</A>. Then follows his description of the ritual, during which 
                                he tells us &quot;the circumcision ritual is . . . a ritual of kinship 
                                unity and indivisibility . . ,&quot; <A
HREF="../library/xtras/refs.html#ref31">(p.84)</A>.... "if we needed 
                                further confirmation, we would have it from the words of the first 
                                song : `It is a blessing that we ask.' " <A HREF="../library/xtras/refs.html#ref71">(p.50-51)</A>. </P></TD>

          male circumcision. Most of the literature shows no awareness 
          of phimosis - its frequency - or the sexual and erectile problems which can be cured by circumcision. If routine circumcision 
          had been introduced for this most obvious reason of eliminating difficult 
          foreskins; then the importance of an alternative modern method, suitable to our culture's attitudes in this day and age, would be clear. </FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                            <P>Bettelheim's "Symbolic Wounds" argues menstruation/vagina envy 
                              as the original motivation behind routine male circumcision. This 
                              replaced the classical psychological interpretation of circumcision 
                              as <A HREF="sacrifice.html#start">a cultural expression of castration 
                                fears and the oedipal complex.</A> Bettelheim immerses his reader 
                              in psychological anthropology, fascinating stuff, well written and 
                              well worth reading. It is an enjoyable book well researched with 
                              much common sense ... except for the passages which discuss a boy 
                              with adhesions. Here Bettelheim demonstrates a problem which the psychological profession clearly misunderstand. The entire story of this boy is related on four pages 
                              (p.32-33, 50 and 53). </P>
                            <P>It must be the psychologists preoccupation with unconscious motives 
                              which leads Bettelheim to demonstrate that this boy's "painful adhesions" 
                              were of a symbolic or psychological nature.</P>
                            <P>Bettelheim suggests the newly freed glans merely <I>represented</I> his masculinity and <I>served</I> as a symbol of maturity<B>:</B> "the freed 
                              glans represented a newly won masculinity" - "the now permanently freed 
                              glans may have served ... to assure him that his sexual maturity had 
                              been attained", and even though the 
                              boy's glans was anatomically hidden Bettelheim suggests it is the penis "he had always <I>tried</I> to hide". </P>
                            <P>Bettelheim says &quot;painful adhesions interfered with full functioning of the penis&quot; - surely then any speculation about  symbolic 
                              meanings should be founded on the obvious fact that the boy would enjoy first and foremost 
                              a physically enjoyable erection.                            </P>

                              At the Orthogenic School, a ten year old uncircumcised boy, living 
                              with a group who had been circumcised in infancy, wanted the operation 
                              very badly. </P>
                            <P>Eventually we had to arrange for his circumcision because of adhesions. 
                              When told about it he was happy but anxious, as was to be expected. 
                              He spoke at great length about his fear of the pain of the operation. 
                              But after it was over he also admitted that he had feared the doctor 
                              would make a mistake and cut off too much or all of his penis. He told 
                              us anxiously that he thought he had heard, about persons born &quot;a 
                              girl and a boy at the same time,&quot; and how the &quot;doctor had 
                              to cut it off&quot; to make the person a girl. Thus he showed his great 
                              castration anxiety.</P>
                            <P>But powerful as his fears were, still more impressive were first 
                              his wish for the operation and afterward his pride in what he called 
                              his "new penis." This emotion overshadowed his castration anxiety throughout. 
                              As soon as the wound was healed he displayed to everybody the penis <I><B>he had always tried to hide</B></I>. As soon as the bandage was 
                              taken off he declared, "I think my penis is very handsome and elegant 
                              now." With great pride he told how much better it functioned, how when 
                              urinating he could make a bigger and better stream and direct it wherever 
                              he chose. Now he fully enjoyed masturbation, which before because of 
                              adhesions, had been partly painful. He summed up his feelings by saying, 
                              "Boy, I can do anything now." Circumcision showed him the organ's importance. <I><B>the freed glans represented a newly won masculinity</B></I>. 
                              Circumcision had indeed provided him with a better penis and with sexual 
                              pleasures not available before. </P>
                            <P>(Page 50)<BR>
                              His case does not permit unequivocal inferences, because first he was 
                              living among boys who had been circumcised since infancy, and second, <I><B>painful adhesions interfered with full functioning of the penis.</B></I> from this we cannot draw conclusions about the emotions of boys in 
                              preliterate societies toward circumcision, if they are not suffering 
                              from adhesions. What his behaviour does show is that living among circumcised 
                              men may make circumcision appear very desirable, </P>
                            <P>(Page 53)<BR>
                              For the boy who wished circumcision, the circumcised penis with <B><I>the 
                                now permanently freed glans may have served </I></B>as well as menstruation <B><I>to assure him that his sexual maturity had been attained.</I></B></P>
                            <P>
                            <HR noshade>
                            <P>Bettelheim says &quot;From this we cannot draw conclusions about 
                              the emotions of boys in pre literate societies toward circumcision, 
                              if they are not suffering from adhesions.&quot; He never follows up 
                              this idea, did he not realise that practically all infants suffer adhesions?, 
                              he could feasably have discussed the memory of this pain motivating 
                              an adult rejection of the foreskin. 
                            <P>Throughout the book there is no mention of the tearing of the frenulum. 
                              It is an astonishing omission for any book discussing menstruation 
                              envy in relation to the origin of routine male circumcision. The 
                              tearing of the frenulum of the male foreskin is an event often accompanied 
                              by pain and intense bleeding. As Grewel says: <A HREF="../library/xtras/refs.html#ref82">(82)</A> "That excoriation of the frenum praeputii has also been neglected 
                              by psychiatrists and psychoanalysts is ... remarkable. The parallelism 
                              with the defloration of the female is too obvious to be ignored."</P>
                            <P>Such an occurrence must have stimulated awe and amazement and been 
                              seen as a great mystery among our forefathers in much the same way 
                              aa men these days. Here is something to parallel any envy or astonishment 
                              at women's mysterious menstruation. Added to this, at least three <A HREF="../ancient_treatment.html#start"> ancient cultures</A> perform an operation related to circumcision: 
                              an incision of the frenulum.</P>
                            <P> It seems a great shame that Bettelheim's thinking was so clouded 
                              by psychology without any actual information on the anatomical problems with 
                              foreskins.</P>         </TD></TR></TABLE></TD>

          male circumcision. Most of the literature shows no awareness 
          of phimosis - its frequency - or the sexual and erectile problems which can be cured by circumcision. If routine circumcision 
          had been introduced for this most obvious reason of eliminating difficult 
          foreskins; then the importance of an alternative modern method, suitable to our culture's attitudes in this day and age, would be clear. </FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P>The first records I can find describe how our cultural forefathers 
                                the Greeks and the Romans practiced infibulation (creating an artificial 
                                phimosis e.g. by binding the end of the foreskin together) (<A HREF="../library/xtras/refs.html#ref57">57</A>). 
                                The Christian message from St. Paul advises us that &quot;The true 
                                circumcision is of the heart&quot; (<A HREF="../library/xtras/refs.html#ref58">58</A>), 
                                thus confirming the culturally acceptable Roman attitude that an 
                                anatomical circumcision was not necessary. <A HREF="diderot_eng.html#start">Diderot</A> writing in 1779 shows how phimosis often led to gangrene etc. before 
                                being operated.</P>
                              <P>All the known facts indicate that in Europe, <A HREF="../statistics.html#start">at 
                                least one man in ten</A> has been slightly but fundamentally anatomically 
                                inhibited, for the last few thousand years!</P>
                              <P>It appears that these men would have had little information about 
                                their conditions, and even less possibility of skilled treatment. 
                                &quot;Circumcision was not common in Europe or North America (except 
                                among Jews) until the 1870s and became widespread at the turn of 
                                the century&quot; (<A HREF="../library/xtras/refs.html#ref59">59</A>). </P>
                              <P>When one individual male is limited or frustrated in the intimate 
                                relationship with his own body, this has an effect on his intimate 
                                relationships with others. This underlying influence magnifies tendencies 
                                of a similar nature and undermines healthy qualities. Seen individually, 
                                this wouldn't have had any exceptional effect on an adaptable community 
                                - but it is when experiences repeat that they establish themselves 
                                personally, and culturally. 
                              <P>How much influence could such a genital disposition actually have 
                                had, if it occurred (unrecognised or untreated) at a frequency of 
                                one in ten, over a period of 2,000 years or a hundred generations? 
                                Could this (for example) be expected to encourage anxiety patterns 
                                and inhibitions in the relating behaviour of the culture?</P>

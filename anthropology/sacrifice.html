          male circumcision. Most of the literature shows no awareness 
          of phimosis - its frequency - or the sexual and erectile problems which can be cured by circumcision. If routine circumcision 
          had been introduced for this most obvious reason of eliminating difficult 
          foreskins; then the importance of an alternative modern method, suitable to our culture's attitudes in this day and age, would be clear. </FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P>Both sacrifice and the castration complex (or the Oedipus complex) 
                                are still widely believed to be the origins of routine circumcision 
                                and used as arguments for discontinuing this practice in the modern 
                                world. There are many sensible reasons against routine circumcision, 
                                the theories on sacrifice and castration lead to even more irrational 
                                thinking on the subject and thus need to be clearly negated 
                              <P>
                              <HR>
                              <B>TO TEACH OEDIPUS A LESSON</B>
                              <P>The Oedipus complex describes how the boy child covets his mother, 
                                however he is in conflict because he fears his father`s retribution: 
                                cutting off his penis. The theory is that when the child grows to man 
                                he re-senses these feelings, and resolves the eternal conflict symbolically 
                                by circumcision of his male offspring. 
                              <P>Is it psychologists or our barbaric forefathers who are incapable 
                                of even the simplest steps of awareness and intelligence as regards 
                                male anatomy? The operation exposes the glans, forming the flaccid 
                                penis in a way which emulates the erect state and thus indicating a 
                                readiness for sexual intercourse (<I>Hastings, Bryk, Ploss</I>). It 
                                is inconceivable that such a measure would be used to diminish or punish 
                                any element of sexual competition. </P>

                              <B>THE SACRIFICE THEORY</B>
                              <P>Though routine circumcison may be seen as a great ignorance from 
                                the viewpoint of modern medical attitudes, the idea that it was introduced 
                                for sacrificial purposes by mutilating young boys is a ridiculous one. 
                              <P>Astoundingly, as recently as the Sept/Oct 1994 edition of the British 
                                Journal of Sexual Medicine, JP Warren FRCP Physician. and J Bigelow 
                                PhD Psychologist argue for:- <BR>
  &quot;<B>The sacrificial origin of circumcision</B>&quot;<BR>
  &quot;The origins of circumcision are lost in antiquity... No doubt 
                                human sacrifice was widespread, and it seems likely that substitutes 
                                for this practice included the sacrifice of domestic animals and mutilations 
                                of the human body, of which circumcision is just one example... <BR>
                                ... An important aspect of sacrifice is the shedding of blood, and 
                                circumcision is a notoriously bloody operation,... <BR>
                                Another aspect of sacrifice is that the object which is forfeited 
                                should be valuable. The greater the value of the object sacrificed, 
                                the more worthy the sacrifice. This should make us wonder what are 
                                the value and function of the prepuce. If it were just a useless 
                                flap of skin, it would not be much of a sacrifice,... This makes 
                                it an ideal sacrificial object, as the circumcised male is able to 
                                function normally in society and to procreate, but suffers permanent 
                                impairment of sexual enjoyment and bears a visible, life-long reminder 
                                of his sacrifice.&quot; <A HREF="../library/xtras/refs.html#ref27">(27)</A></P>

                              <B>THE SACRIFICE THEORY NEGATED</B>
                              <P>Circumcision was not a substitute for human sacrifice because routine 
                                circumcision developed <I>previous</I> to ritual sacrifice. 
                              <P>The Encyclopedia Brittanica says - &quot;Blood sacrifice is linked... 
                                with the cultures... of the cultivators&quot; <A HREF="../library/xtras/refs.html#ref37">(37)</A>. 
                                Practices involving blood sacrifice developed among the cultivating 
                                peoples, because they had an understanding of fertility. They believed 
                                that by sacrificing they were renewing life.</P>
                              <P>As any origins connected with <A HREF="fertility.html#start">fertility</A> have been conclusively rebutted by anthropological sources since 
                                the 1930s and as the thought associations from fertility to sacrifice 
                                are one step more abstract, then sacrifice could not have been among 
                                the original motives for the introduction of the routine practice.</P>
                              <P>So much to the facts, as I understand them - <B>now I wish to speculate</B> <BR>
                                I believe the subject deserves greater clarity because so often mutilation 
                                and sacrifice are brought into the modern argument against routine 
                                infant circumcision and while I agree with the intention, this line 
                                of reasoning confuses common sense and is thus counter productive. 
                                (It is also an interesting subject, if anyone wishes to discuss the 
                                following, please write) 
                              <P>Firstly, for the peoples who performed it, sacrifice was treated 
                                with great respect and as the highest expression of their cultural 
                                thoughts and perspectives. On the other hand most mutilations (as we 
                                would define them) were considered by the folks who performed them 
                                as enhancing the beauty and/or social acceptability of the individual. 
                              <P>When those motivated by the modern medical disgrace of routine infant 
                                circumcision, compare RIC with sacrifice as a mutilation, then I believe 
                                they are associating with the prisoners who were sacrificed by conquering 
                                tribes. and in this sense we could talk of sacrificing someone by mutilating 
                                him - but then one could imagine removing the penis, but to remove 
                                the foreskin and encourage a state which many men feel is preferable, 
                                this would be fully illogical. 
                              <P>Sacrifice could have involved his fingers. his ears, his penis, 
                                - but why his foreskin? which form of self denial could motivate an 
                                operation which forms his penis to emulate the erect member, a state 
                                which many men choose and are happy with. The element of having lost 
                                something appears only to be evident subjectively among a few people 
                                - the distinguishing lines are so unclear that I doubt any God would 
                                fulfill any wish in exchange for such a token - it appears inconceivable 
                                that natural peoples would introduce such an indistinct measure to 
                                demonstrate or induce anything at all. 
                              <P>Lets reconsider: Sacrifice as a form of self-denial - as pennance 
                                (out of guilt) or used to be pleasing to Gods and ancestors, impress 
                                lovers etc.; must exist as a very basic motivation - we can date a 
                                concept of the supernatural previous to fertility: (that aborigenes 
                                understand procreation in terms of a spirit child is evidence of this). 
                                - Could one of the natural peoples have circumcised himself as a form 
                                of self sacrifice, I see no reason why not! - <B>I see removing painful 
                                  foreskins as a far more obvious and dynamic urge</B> - but yes, I would 
                                agree that circumcision could have been first performed for sacrificial 
                                reasons - but this refers only to this first operation. As above, the 
                                results being more pleasing than showing a mark of any loss, thus the 
                                sacrificial thought would lose its substance and would motivate no 
                                similar operation on kith and kin. 
                              <P>Purely out of interest are there any other sacrifical practices 
                                which were practiced routinely on every member of a tribe? - (apart 
                                from taxation :-) 
                              <P>Are cultural sacrificial practices the projection of self denial?

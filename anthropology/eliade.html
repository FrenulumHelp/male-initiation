          male circumcision. Most of the literature shows no awareness 
          of phimosis - its frequency - or the sexual and erectile problems which can be cured by circumcision. If routine circumcision 
          had been introduced for this most obvious reason of eliminating difficult 
          foreskins; then the importance of an alternative modern method, suitable to our culture's attitudes in this day and age, would be clear. </FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P><B>CIRCUMCISION</B> is the surgical removal of the foreskin from 
                                the penis; sometimes it also refers to less common practices of uncovering 
                                the glans of the penis by removing some of the foreskin and leaving 
                                the remainder as a flap, as practiced by the Maasai and Kikuyu of East 
                                Africa, or cutting the foreskin away but retaining it as two flaps, 
                                as practiced by the Tikopia of Polynesia. Early social theorists speculated 
                                about circumcision's origins, suggesting that it may have (1) marked 
                                captives, thereby signifying subjection, (2) attracted the opposite 
                                sex, (3) been a tribal or ethnic mark, (4) been hygienic, (5) increased 
                                sexual pleasure, (6) removed men from maternal bonds, (7) tested bravery, 
                                (8) sacrificed part of the self to ensure future rebirth, (9) been 
                                a form of symbolic castration to support the domination of youths by 
                                their elders, or (10) even simulated menstruation. None of these theories 
                                is accepted today, though various combinations of them may be cited 
                                by those groups who circumcise. 
                              <P><B>Geographic Distribution</B>. Circumcision is commonly associated 
                                with Semitic religions (Islam, Judaism, and Coptic Christianity), but, 
                                in fact, it predates all of these. It was practiced among ancient Egyptians, 
                                although not universally. It is widespread among peoples in Africa, 
                                western Asia, and the Pacific, including Australia. Early travelers' 
                                records and encyclopedias report circumcision among some New World 
                                peoples, but these accounts seem dubious, and, at most, the practice 
                                there appears to have been rare. Circumcision was not common in Europe 
                                or North America (except among Jews) until the 1870s and became widespread 
                                only at the turn of the century. Today about 85 percent of newborn 
                                American males undergo the operation, but it is far less common elsewhere 
                                in the English-speaking world and in Europe. It is our only form of 
                                prophylactic surgery, and currently members of the medical profession 
                                are in disagreement as to whether it is scientifically justifiable. 
                                Some cite its prevalence in America as an indication of a misconceived 
                                preoccupation with medicine and hygiene. 
                              <P><B>Semitic Circumcision</B>. Muslims, Jews, and Coptic Christians 
                                usually circumcise during infancy. Ideally Jews circumcise on the eighth 
                                day of life. Among Orthodox Jews circumcision is performed by a professional 
                                circumciser (mohel) rather than a physician, and blood must be drawn 
                                from the wound either by mouth or, today, through a suction pump. In 
                                America, Jews have figured significantly in developing surgical devices 
                                that facilitate the operation. Circumcision is not strictly necessary 
                                to make one a Jew: since 1892, for example, Reform Jews have not required 
                                it of converts. Before the Hellenistic period circumcision among Jews 
                                took a less radical form than it does today. Because some Jews would 
  "blister" the portion of their foreskin that remained in order to appear 
                                uncircumcised to the Greeks and Romans, the rabbinate advocated a fuller 
                                circumcision. Some hellenized Jews sought to appear uncircumcised because 
                                the Greeks and Romans viewed the practice with revulsion and periodically 
                                enacted laws to make the custom difficult for Jews and Egyptians under 
                                their rule. 
                              <P>Muslim circumcision usually occurs on what is termed the seventh 
                                day (in fact it is the eighth day, since the day of birth is not counted). 
                                In practice, the time varies widely. Some Muslims perform circumcision 
                                within the first five or six years; others delay it until as late as 
                                adolescence. While circumcision is not discussed in the Qur'&auml;n, Muslims 
                                agree that it must occur before marriage and is required of male converts. 
                                In many cases, it is accompanied by lavish feasts and celebrations. 
                                A few Arabs combine circumcision with radical flaying and scarification 
                                of the lower abdomen. 
                              <P>Coptic Christians (including Ethiopians) circumcise in imitation 
                                of Old Testament Jews, but the time at which circumcision is performed 
                                varies from the first week of life to the first few years. 
                              <P><B>Circumcision and Ethnicity.</B> Besides signifying membership 
                                in a religion, circumcision may indicate, ethnicity or merely a human 
                                condition properly marked by the creativity of culture. Thus the Yoruba 
                                and Igbo of Nigeria usually circumcise during infancy; for them the 
                                operation signifies no religious or moral commitments nor does it distinguish 
                                them from their neighbors, who also circumcise. Even in respect to 
                                a single society generalizations about circumcision may be formulated 
                                with difficulty, as examples from Africa will illustrate. The western 
                                Dinka of the Sudan circumcise while the eastern Dinka do not. Their 
                                neighbors, the Nuer, do not ordinarily circumcise, but on rare occasions 
                                they may, in order to purify someone who has committed incest. Among 
                                the Azande of the Sudan and Zaire circumcision was introduced by neighboring 
                                peoples, with the result that within even the same village or extended 
                                kin group some will be circumcised while others will not. Among the 
                                Amba of Uganda circumcision was unknown until an unexplained interest 
                                in the custom, learned from neighbors to the west, led to sporadic 
                                waves of circumcision among youths and even adults. 
                              <P>Among the Sotho of southern Africa circumcision was once universal, 
                                but under government and mission influence many have abandoned the 
                                practice while others continue to observe it. Among some migratory 
                                pygmies in Zaire circumcision has been interpreted as a mark of cultural 
                                subjugation to their sedentary African overlords. Even where circumcision 
                                is a traditional practice and remains prevalent it now often takes 
                                place in hospitals, despite protests from elders, who advocate the 
                                old ways. 
                              <P><B><A NAME="initiation"></A>Circumcision and Rites of Sexual lnitiation.</B> Where circumcision 
                                is associated with a world religion, it rarely marks sexual maturity. 
                                Such an association is common, however, among preliterates, although 
                                even among these many peoples circumcise infants or children rather 
                                than adolescents. Early circumcision may be a mark of ethnicity, or 
                                it may be considered hygienic or aesthetically attractive, but it does 
                                not provide a means by which trauma may be harnessed to the inculcation 
                                of moral and metaphysical values, as occurs in many rituals of initiation. 
                                Nor can infantile circumcision serve as a test of bravery. These aspects 
                                of circumcision, however, are of special interest to the anthropologist 
                                of religion. 
                              <P> Among the societies that practice circumcision as a rite of passage 
                                to adulthood, those of central Australia and East Africa provide the 
                                most complex and dramatic examples. 
                              <P>In central Australia circumcision is the primary operation in defining 
                                male adulthood, although it is often accompanied by tooth evulsion, 
                                bodily scarification, and, a year or two later, subincision. Much pressure 
                                is exerted on the initiate to show no fear or pain. Among those Australian 
                                Aborigines who practice circumcision (and not all do), the operation 
                                marks the beginning of a youth's indoctrination into the men's secret 
                                ceremonial life, the preservation of which is believed to be vital 
                                for maintaining social and natural harmony. At this time novices witness 
                                complex ceremonies in which the mythical origins of the world are enacted 
                                and, thereby, the order of the world is reasserted. The initial rites 
                                convey only basic features of this information; only after a man has 
                                witnessed many such ceremonies over the years, first as a spectator-novice, 
                                then as an actor-participant, and finally as an organizer, does he 
                                become truly knowledgeable. Circumcision, therefore, is not only the 
                                occasion when a youth passes into the circle of informed adults, but 
                                it also provides repeated opportunities for him to continue to acquire 
                                deeper knowledge of traditions. 
                              <P>Australian circumcision furthers male solidarity by forever separating 
                                youths from their mothers. The initiates receive ritual objects that 
                                are forbidden to the sight of women. Admitted to frequent and complex 
                                secret male ritual activities, they begin to spend longer periods away 
                                from camp at ceremonies that exclude women. It is only after these 
                                rituals that a youth is likely to have heterosexual relations and marry. 
                                Male solidarity sometimes involves a homosexual experience, since a 
                                circumciser may be obliged to have sexual relations with a newly recovered 
                                novice to whom he will later give a wife. 
                              <P>Aborigines associate circumcision with marriage not simply to prepare 
                                a man to take a wife but to reinforce the bonds the man enjoys with 
                                the men of his wife's family. Thus a man's potential father-in-law 
                                and brothers-in-law, his own father, and his uncles (his father's affinal 
                                ties and members of the group that helped to circumcise his father) 
                                often figure in his circumcision. Male solidarity and hierarchy are 
                                closely associated with the bestowal of and submission to pain, a prevalent 
                                theme in Aboriginal belief and ritual. This in turn relates to the 
                                fact that periodically in a society circumcision and subincision involve 
                                the shedding of male "genital blood," a blessing with deep mystical 
                                value for the reestablishment of social and moral order through altruistic, 
                                sacrificial suffering. 
                              <P>Circumcision is widespread in East Africa. Among sedentary speakers 
                                of Bantu language it is usually performed annually on groups of youths 
                                approaching adolescence. These groups are segregated in the bush (the 
                                sphere of disorder) apart from villages and women. Novices are stripped, 
                                shaved, bathed, and sometimes marked with ashes or white earth, all 
                                to denude them of their previous status and to place them in a liminal 
                                state, neither minor nor adult. The actual operation is often performed 
                                by an expert who is outside or peripheral to the group. Bravery under 
                                pain is usually required. The shedding of blood is viewed as polluting, 
                                a "hot" procedure that temporarily creates disorder so as to achieve 
                                a greater eventual order. Rituals and medicines are therefore applied 
                                to "cool" the wound and allow it to heal. 
                              <P>During their weeks of recovery, novices are hazed by older circumcised 
                                youths or by elders. They fast and observe numerous prohibitions, as 
                                may also their kin, in order to ensure recovery. In their isolated 
                                quarters, the novices - vulnerable and impressionable because of the 
                                wounds, fasting, and exposure that they have suffered are subjected 
                                to intensive instructions about sexual behavior, moral attitudes, and 
                                proper conduct. Toward the end of their confinement, the novices may 
                                don strange garb and tour nearby villages representing their status 
                                of being nameless, nonsocial creatures. Upon recovery, they return 
                                to their homes and enjoy the company of women at dances and feasts 
                                that celebrate their new adulthood. Circumcision marks their ritual 
                                death as minors and their rebirth as responsible adults. 
                              <P>In other East African societies, especially Para-Nilotest such as 
                                the Maasai, rites of circumcision are not held every year. Instead, 
                                they are held for several successive years until a sufficient group 
                                is recruited; then the rites are not practiced for some time. Through 
                                circumcision men enter named tribal age groups whose members provide 
                                mutual aid and hospitality and, when young, form fighting units. 
                              <P>In East Africa and Australia circumcision is understood to remove 
                                the vestiges of polluting femininity (the foreskin) from a youth, converting 
                                him into an adult male. lt provides a powerful measure of commitment 
                                to group values in the face of considerable suffering, and it represents 
                                a permanent moral and physical transformation. Women are afforded no 
                                comparable process, and (despite any physical operation) they remain 
                                minors subordinate to men, according to the norms that govern social 
                                organization. Where such initiation occurs we find the belief that 
                                society improves upon nature by transforming the male body into a more 
                                proper vehicle for a moral person to inhabit. The social person and 
                                the natural body are brought into closer conjunction. The endurance 
                                of pain and the observance of ritual restrictions express both a willingness 
                                and a capacity to subject personal appetites and feelings to collective 
                                ends. At the same time the powers that shape the cultural process assume 
                                a physical reality in the experience of bodily suffering.

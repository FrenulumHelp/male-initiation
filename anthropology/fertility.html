          male circumcision. Most of the literature shows no awareness 
          of phimosis - its frequency - or the sexual and erectile problems which can be cured by circumcision. If routine circumcision 
          had been introduced for this most obvious reason of eliminating difficult 
          foreskins; then the importance of an alternative modern method, suitable to our culture's attitudes in this day and age, would be clear. </FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P>The anthropologists who rejected the phimosis-fertility theory and in fact any of the theories involving fertility, did 
                                this for the reason that the lower cultures (the hunting tribes) did 
                                not possess the facility of abstract thought necessary to understand 
                                fertility or the facts of life about semen and the conception of babies. 
                              <P>Spencer-Gillan <A HREF="../library/xtras/refs.html#ref64">(97)</A> reported that the hunting tribes who they studied &quot;have no 
                                idea of procreation as being directly associated with sexual intercourse, 
                                and firmly believe that children can be born without this taking 
                                place.&quot; <A HREF="../library/xtras/refs.html#ref64">(64)</A> Bettelheim

                                    which appears to be one of theirs. </P></TD>

                              <P>It is frankly amazing how much thought has been put into the irrelevant 
                                question of if phimosis hinders fertility. A series of medical studies 
                                which continued through the 1800s right up until the 1960s investigated 
                              this.                               
                              <P>In turn many anthropologists believed that the only medical 
                                significance of phimosis was the influence it had on fertility.
                                
                              <P>The answer the doctors eventually decided  was that phimosis does not effect 
                                sperm-count and so scientifically speaking it does not effect fertility.
                              <P>Perhaps the entire discussion about fertility reflects the legacy 
                                of 19th century sexual attitudes where morality reigned and the sole 
                              purpose of sexual contact was considered to be fertilisation.                               
                              <P>Primitive peoples were arguably not so prudish. The desire for sex is based on an instinct, and the natural peoples 
                                would have wanted sex regardless of any ulterior motive or abstract 
                                reason for having sex. Such a profound instinct can certainly manifest 
                                in a number of different ways, and can be understood from a number 
                                of perspectives.
                              <P>Whatever meaning sex might have had, I believe the anatomical 
                                reality of pain difficulty and frustration from phimosis during sex, 
                                would require no deep explanation - and from the perspective of a 
                                people who required practical answers, the best reasoning would have 
                                been done with a sharp knife.

                                also finds its origins in hunting tribes. Some hunting tribes who 
                                practice circumcision have no sense of the facts of life about conception.

                              <P><A NAME="road"></A>Kaberry in "Aboriginal Women, Sacred and Profane" 
                                wrote in 1931 "I investigated the problem as exhaustively as possible, 
                                and these natives in spite of over thirty years contact with the 
                                white had still no idea of the true relation between sexual intercourse 
                                and conception. The aborigines asserted that a young girl could not 
                                bear children; after puberty conception only occurred when a man, 
                                generally her husband, found a spirit child. Questioned on the function 
                                of sexual intercourse natives admitted that it prepared the way for 
                                entry of the spirit child, "Him made `em road ...; young girl no 
                                got `em road." Most women believed that the semen remained in the 
                                vagina and had nothing to do with the child. "Him nothing," was the 
                                trenchant reply, when after circuitous inquiry I finally suggested 
                                the facts of the case. Several women thought that the semen entered 
                                the uterus, and that the embryo floated in it "like a waterlily," 
                                as one expressed it. Natives with a hint of ridicule for the illogicality 
                                of the white would declare impatiently -"All day me bin sleep alonga 
                                him. Me no more bin catch `em picaninny." A Forest River women whose 
                                child was born some months after her husband`s death, advanced this 
                                as evidence of the irrelevance of sexual intercourse, which all natives, 
                                apart from its preparatory function, regarded simply as an erotic 
                                pastime." <A HREF="../library/xtras/refs.html#ref96">(96)</A></P>                              </TD>

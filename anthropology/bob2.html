          male circumcision. Most of the literature shows no awareness 
          of phimosis - its frequency - or the sexual and erectile problems which can be cured by circumcision. If routine circumcision 
          had been introduced for this most obvious reason of eliminating difficult 
          foreskins; then the importance of an alternative modern method, suitable to our culture's attitudes in this day and age, would be clear. </FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P>Because of well-remembered problems I had as a child, I became 
                                something of an authority on foreskins and the various ways of managing 
                                them before I entered the US Army, which subsequently afforded me the 
                                opportunity of observing thousands of penises of all sizes and conditions. 
                                One method of treating the foreskin often utilized in North America 
                                between the wars and before near-universal circumcision became established, 
                                was simply to keep the foreskin pushed back or rolled up behind the 
                                glans, so this stayed exposed at all times. ... 
                              <P>The common method of keeping the foreskin &quot;skinned-back&quot;, 
                                was to pull the foreskin back as far as it would go, then fold it inward 
                                upon itself and roll it forward until it formed a sleeve of skin behind 
                                the glans that left this permanently exposed. Without question literally 
                                millions of American men born between 1900 and 1930 would have appeared 
                                to the casual observer to be circumcised, but they were not. ... I 
                                once heard one man in a theater line (all male) at Ft. Campbell, Kentucky, 
                                tell a companion, 'Mine looks circumcised but it's not; it just stays 
                                skinned-back all the time.&quot; Then I heard one GI tell another, 
                                &quot;I'm not skinned-back like him.!&quot;</P>
                              <P>A doctor from Saginaw, Michigan writing in 1951 coined the term 
                                &quot;autocircumcision&quot; to name the condition of a penis that 
                                appeared circumcised but had no history of surgery. He estimated 
                                at the time he was writing that probably 1/3 of the males living 
                                in his area of practice were circumcised, with a greater proportion 
                                of the population among younger men and boys. He estimated that of 
                                men born in 1900, 5 percent were circumcised, 15 percent were autocircumcised, 
                                and the remaining 80 percent remained as God had made them. He assumed 
                                that most of the autocircumcised were that way through their own 
                                choice; nobody else had made them alter their penises. Nowadays, 
                                almost 50 years after the time he wrote, the estimate is that some 
                                85 percent of males living in the Midwestern USA are circumcised, 
                                so very few boys were left with a foreskin to modify for themselves, 
                                as many of their grandfathers had done. Most of the autocircumcised 
                                men you'll find in North America today are 70 years of age and older.</P>
                              <P>Historically, one group of Native Americans at least, the Lakotah 
                                branch of the Sioux, also practiced autocircumcision commonly. According to Ruth Beebe Hill (in Hanto Yo, Doubleday, 
                                Garden City, New York, 1979) their word for the adult penis translates 
                                literally as "foreskin pushed back." I submit that these men practiced 
                                autocircumcision for other than aesthetic reasons. The value of anyh 
                                practice that eliminated non-venereal penile infections would be 
                                high in a population of nomads whose survival depended upon the ability 
                                to move swiftly, on horseback, at a moment's notice.</P>
                              <P>Non-surgical penile modifications are reported occasionally in European 
                                literature but would seem to be less common there than in the USA: 
                                one of Moll Flanders' customers had a penis that was &quot;half-capt.&quot; 
                                Also, Charles Darwin reported a lady from Chelsea who was astonished 
                                to find that her 2 sons (age not given) appeared to be circumcised 
                                although she was not Jewish and had not had them &quot;done.&quot; 
                                Apparently they had been experimenting with their penises and had left 
                                them permanently &quot;skinned-back.&quot; 
                              <P>Also, near the beginning of the 3-hour 1977 Italian movie &quot;1900,&quot; 
                                the boy who plays Robert DiNiro as a kid wanders into some tall grass 
                                with a friend (evidently one of the children of a peasant tenant on 
                                the family estate), where they are apparently relieving themselves, 
                                and tells the friend, &quot;See, mine looks like yours now; I yanked 
                                it back!&quot; So, wherever there are boys with uncut penises, there 
                                is likely to be experimentation. ...</P>
                              <P>... Auto-circumcision appears to have been fairly common in 19th-Century 
                                North America (excluding Quebec), judging from woodcut illustrations 
                                of medical textbooks of the period, plus references to keeping the 
                                prepuce 'withdrawn' behind the glans. This is based on a surgery textbook 
                                printed in Philadelphia in 1868 that belonged to my grandfather, a 
                                physician who died in 1920. ....</P>
                              <P>There are some recorded reports of circumcision ceremonies observed 
                                among natural groups, such as (not yet Sir) Alexander MacKenzie's observation 
                                of the Sioux's neighbors the Ojibwa (or Chippewas) in what's now Canada 
                                in the 1700's, and Basedow's graphic description of circumcision and 
                                subincision as practiced by the Arundta (sometimes spelled Aranta) 
                                in Australia in the 1930's. (Incidentally, did you hear that when an 
                                anthropologist asked some Australian aborigines why they circumcised, 
                                they said, &quot;We don't know, we just always have!&quot; Not too 
                                different from 20th C. Anglophone North Americans, right?) Also, the 
                                Chimu/Mochica of coastal Peru, whose genitalia are carefully depicted 
                                on many ceramic pieces of high quality in the Larco-Hoyle Museum in 
                                Lima, pretty definitely were circumcised, judging from the available 
                                evidence.</P>

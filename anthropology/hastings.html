        <P><FONT SIZE="2">Experts have been unable to understand the origin of the practice of routine 
          male circumcision. Most of the literature shows no awareness 
          of phimosis - its frequency - or the sexual and erectile problems which can be cured by circumcision. If routine circumcision 
          had been introduced for this most obvious reason of eliminating difficult 
          foreskins; then the importance of an alternative modern method, suitable to our culture's attitudes in this day and age, would be clear. </FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P>CIRCUMCISION (Introductory).-The term 'circumcision' is applied, 
                                in its strict sense, to a wide-spread surgical operation for the 
                                ablation of the male prepuce, and also, with a looser connotation, 
                                to simple incision of the prepuce, or even to two operations on the 
                                female genitals - clitoridectomy and ablation of the <I>labia minora</I> (the so-called 'female circumcision'). The operation on males is 
                                very common, not only among many primitive peoples as well as among 
                                some which have attained a high degree of civilization, but even 
                                in modern surgery, where it is, of course, performed solely for sanitary 
                                and therapeutic reasons - an explanation which, though not uncommonly 
                                urged, is not wholly satisfactory in accounting for its ultimate 
                                origin or for its practice among primitive races. The corresponding 
                                female operation is far more rare, both surgically and as a rite.</P>
                              <P>ANATOMICAL ASPECTS.-The male prepuce is a loose fold of skin, lined 
                                on the inner side with mucous membrane, covering the <I>glans penis, </I>at whose base (the <I>corona glandis</I>) it is attached to the 
                                penis ; while on the under side of the organ it has a further union 
                                with the <I>glans</I> by a fold termed the <I>fraenum praeputii. </I>On the <I>corona glandis</I> open the <I>glandulae odoriferae,</I>which 
                                generate a sebaceous secretion called <I>smegma praeputii</I> In 
                                modern surgery the necessity for circumcision arises chiefly in case 
                                of phimosis, a condition, whether congenital or acquired, in which 
                                the prepuce cannot be retracted so as to uncover the <I>glans </I>(this 
                                condition often giving rise to retention of urine, balanitis from 
                                accumulation of <I>smegma</I>, calculous concentrations, impotence, <I>prolapsus ani</I>, cancer of the penis, balanoposthitis, and other 
                                complaints), or in hypertrophy of the prepuce.</P>
                              <P>In its characteristic form the operation of circumcision consists 
                                in drawing forward the prepuce (with proper precaution as by a shield 
                                to prevent any incision of the <I>glans</I>) which, when sufficiently 
                                protracted, is amputated, the flow of blood, which is relatively slight, 
                                being checked by some styptic. Among primitive peoples as well as among 
                                Jews and Muhammadans, the wound is then permitted to heal ; but in

                              <P>After the ablation has been effected, it will be found that the 
                                surgeon has removed only a circle of skin, while the mucous membrane 
                                lining the prepuce still tightly embraces the <I>glans</I>; this he 
                                slits up, by introducing the point of a pair of scissors at the preputial 
                                orifice; and then, trimming off the angles of the flaps of mucous membrane, 
                                and sometimes snipping, across the <I>fraenum</I>, he turns back the 
                                mucous membrane, and attaches it to the edge of the cutaneous incision 
                                by sutures, usually of silk or catgut. Union readily takes place by 
                                simple dressing.</P>
                              <P>The physiological change arising from circumcision, apart from obviation 
                                of the dangers of phimosis or the inconvenience of hypertrophy is 
                                that the mucous membrane covering the <I>glans</I> becomes obdurated 
                                and approximates the character of epidermis, thus lessening liability 
                                to venereal and other infections. </P>

                                with the exception of Europe and non-Semitic Asia. The Indo-Germanic 
                                peoples, the Mongols, and the Finno-Ugric races (except where they 
                                have been influenced by Muhammadanism) alone are entirely unacquainted 
                                with it. (1) It can scarcely have been practised in pre-Aryan India 
                                (obviously we have no data, regarding pre Indo-Germanic Europe), 
                                for there in no allusion to it in Sanscrit literature and no trace 
                                of it in modern India, even among peoples untouched by Hindu civilization. 
                                The custom is best known popularly from the Semites, especially the 
                                Hebrews and Muhammadans, as well as from the ancient Egyptians and 
                                Colchians (the latter, according to Herodotus [ii. 104 f.], closely 
                                akin to the Egyptians), while something analogous was practised by 
                                some American Indians (for all these see the following sections).

                                form of male circumcision is a simple gash of the prepuce. This seems 
                                to be especially characteristic of the American continent and the 
                                Pacific islands, being found among the Totonacs of eastern Mexico 
                                and probably among the Mayas, as well as among the Orang, Buenua 
                                and in Tahiti, in the Marquesas, Waihu, Tonga, Samoa, Kunaie, New

                                some Australian tribes, and especially in East New Guinea and other

                                Wajagga, and a few of the Kikuyu, a similar cut is made on the upper 
                                part of the <I>glans</I>, and the resulting flaps of skin are permitted 
                                to hang from the <I>fraenum.</I></P>
                              <P>In the Aarau Archipelago and in Seranglao the upper part of the 
                                prepuce is pinched off (for the motive in these territories see below, 
                                under (<I>m</I>) (<I>v</I>). Among the Tatars a wedge-shaped piece 
                                is excised from the prepuce ; and an Arab tribe between Abu Arish 
                                and Hejaz not only ablate the prepuce but also make an incision on 
                                the skin on the upper side of the penis extending the entire length 
                                of the organ, and in addition, abscise a portion of the skin of the 
                                lower part of the abdomen. In Jewish circumcision there is a noteworthy 
                                deviation, which has a special reason. The original rite was doubtless 
                                simple ablation of the prepuce; but with contact with classical civilisation, 
                                the desire not to be different from the uncircumcised Greeks who 
                                surrounded themselves in the Gymnasia led the Jews to resort to the 
                                operation of epispasm, by which &sect; (I Mac 1,19; cf. 1 Co 7,18, 
                                Jos. <I>Ant</I>.. xii. v. 1, and also the Talmudic passages cited 
                                in <I>JE </I>iv. 93, see also the 'Semitic' section below; for a 
                                description of the operation, which in now scarcely performed, 'except 
                                possibly to restore lose of substance from accident or disease' [E. 
                                M. L.] cf. Celsus, xxv. 1). To obviate the possibility of such concealment 
                                of Judaism, the Rabbis, probably after Bar Cochba's war (early 2nd 
                                cent. A.D.), made <I>peri`ah</I> (exposure of the <I>glans) </I>an 
                                indispensable requisite td valid circumcision. In this operation, 
                                after the excision has been completed, the <I>mohel</I> ("circumciser 
                                ') seizes the inner lining of the prepuce, which still covers the <I>glans</I>, with the thumb-nail and index-finger of each hand, 
                                and tears it so that he can roll it fully back over the <I>glans</I> and expose the latter completely' (Friedenwald . in <I>JE </I>iv.

                                and normally performed about a year after circumcision proper. This 
                                is defined as, sub-incision of the penis, so that the penile urethra 
                                is laid open from the <I>meatus</I> right back to the junction with 
                                the scrotum ' (Spencer-Gillen, p. 263) This operation, as performed 
                                m the Boula district, is described as follows by Roth <I>(Ethnolog.

                                holds the penis firm and tense with both hands, the actual operator, 
                                seated on the ground in front, makes a superficial incision, through 
                                skin only, extending, from the external <I>meatus</I> down to near 
                                the scrotal pouch in a line with the median <I>raph&eacute;</I>; 
                                a deeper incision is next made with the same stone knife along the 
                                same line as the first, and, starting from the external orifice, 
                                opens up the canal as it is pushed onwards. The extent of the wound 
                                is apparently inconsistent. 1 have observed it varying from a little 
                                over half an inch in some to a gash opening up almost the whole of 
                                the penis as low down as half an inch from the scrotum, in others.' 
                                Among the Yaroinga of the Upper Georgina district the operation consists 
                                of two vertical cuts into the urethra extending from the external 
                                orifice, with a third independently transverse one below, the resulting 
                                flap of skin being allowed to take its own time apparently in subsequently 
                                rotting off down to the transverse cut`<I>(ib.)</I>.</P>

                                to a Talmudic Tradition, the tribe of Levi, which alone during the 
                                Exodus observed the obligation of circumcision, piled up the ablated 
                                foreskins in the wilderness and covered them with earth, a practice 
                                which later became General (Kohler, in <I>JE</I> iv. 93). Among the 
                                East African Wakiku the prepuce in buried in the ground in front 
                                of the boy just circumcised; while the African Bara father throws 
                                it into the river. From fear of its being used in black magic the 
                                Turks bury the prepuce as they do parings of nails, etc., and from 
                                a like motive the Amaxosa Kafir boy carries away his prepuce and 
                                buries it in a sacred spot. On the West Coast of Africa the prepuce, 
                                soaked in brandy, is swallowed by the boy operated on ; the Arabs 
                                of Algiers wrap it in a cloth and put it on a tree or animal, which 
                                then becomes the gift to the operator; and the Hova of Madagascar 
                                wrap it in a banana leaf, which is given to a calf to eat. Among 
                                the Wolof, on the other hand, the prepuce is dried and carried by 
                                the lad circumcised, the object being the promotion of virility 1). 
                                The Sakalava of Madagascar formerly made the operator swallow the 
                                prepuce which he had just ablated (the prepuce of the crown-prince 
                                is still swallowed by his uncle in Madagascar), but at the present 
                                time the foreskin is shot from a gun (a practise also observed by 
                                the Antankarana of the same island), or is fastened to a spear which 
                                is thrown over the house of the lad`s father ; if the spear falls 
                                sticking in the earth, it is a good omen. The triangular pieces excised 
                                by the Taters are given to the boys mothers, who wrap them in cloth 
                                and keep them; but if the mothers are dead or absent the pieces are

                              <P>An interesting case of the gradual introduction of circumcision 
                                may be witnessed in some of the New Hebrides group. 'lt has come 
                                up from Ambrym to the lower end of Pentecost, as a prevailing custom,

                                no religious or superstitious character; it is a social distinction... 
                                There is no doubt that the custom, for it is not a rite, has come 
                                across from the eastwards to the Southern New Hebrides' (Codrington,

                              <P><A NAME="g"></A>(<I>g</I>) <B>Who circumcise</B>.-In primitive 
                                conditions it would naturally be some near kinsman who would perform 
                                the operation of circumcision. Among the early Hebrews this was apparently 
                                the head of the household or the father (Gn 17, 23ff.), though in 
                                case of special necessity it might perhaps be performed even by the 
                                mother (cf. possibly Ex 4. 25 ; 1 Mac 1 60 is not decisive in view 
                                of v. 61 ; for a divergent view, see the 'Semitic' section of this 
                                art.), while a leader or man of importance might also cause it to 
                                be performed (Jos 5, 2ff, 1 Mac 2, 46). In later times, however, 
                                the rite was performed by a specially trained man, usually called <I>mohel</I> ('circumciser'). In Nias, in the Malay Archipelago, 
                                it is likewise the father who circumcises ; but in Nukahiva, in the 
                                Marquesas group, on the contrary the father is the one person who 
                                is debarred from performing circumcision. From the Heb. use of &sect; 
                                (lit. `circumciser`) and &sect; (lit. `circumcised`) in the senses 
                                of 'wife's father' and 'daughter's husband' respectively, it would 
                                appear, since them terms first occur in connexion with Midianites 
                                (Ex 3,1 4,16,25f. , Nu 10,29 , Jg 12,16). and Sodomites (Gn 19, 12- 
                                14), that among these two peoples circumcision was performed by the 
                                future father-in-law. From these passages the words &sect; and &sect; 
                                seem to have passed into the Heb. vocabulary with an entire loss 
                                of their original meaning, connoting merely 'father-in-law' and 'son-in-law' 
                                respectively (<I>e.g.</I> Dt27,23[feminine), Jgl5,6, 19,4f,7,9, 1 
                                S 18,18, 2 K 8,27 Neh 6,18, Jer 7, 34, JI 2,16). The most respected 
                                member of the family is chosen by the Antankarana of Madagascar, 
                                and among the Mandingo of West Africa the village elders perform 
                                it. The priest is the operator in Morocco, Samaria, Western Mexico, 
                                Tahiti, the Sandwich Islands, the Marquesas, and Easter Island, as 
                                well as among the Totonacs, as is the head priest in the mock survival 
                                among the Bani Chams, and the 'witch doctor' among such African tribes 
                                as the Masai, Wanika, and Wakikuya. Too much cannot, however, be 
                                safely deduced from the choice of priests as circumcisers, for Andree <I>(op. cit. </I>p. 75) rightly calls attention to the fact that 
                                among primitive peoples the priest and the physician are commonly 
                                united in the same person, and the operation falls within the domain 
                                of the latter.' In Persia, Turkestan, and Upper Egypt the barber 
                                (with <I>quasi</I>-surgical functions like his mediaeval European 
                                confr&egrave;re) takes the place of the priest ; and in Samoa, as 
                                among the African Wakamba, Wanika, and Kikuyu, a paid professional 
                                (somewhat analogous to the Jewish <I>mohel</I>) officiates The smith 
                                is the circumciser among the West African Sarakolese, and in Kita

                                in the same districts, below, 3(f)); and in Samoa cases are even 
                                reported in which boys circumcise each other. Among the Falashas, 
                                three old women perform the operation (cf. the occasional circumcision 
                                by women among the ancient Hebrews) ; and perhaps the most remarkable 
                                officiant of all is the common executioner, who is the circumciser 
                                among the Sakalava of Madagascar. Among the Australian Unmatjera

                                drawn, in the present writer's opinion, for normal Hebrew usage from 
                                Ex 4,25, 1 Mac l, 60f). The Totonacs circumcised in the temple, and 
                                the Hebrews in the father's house, although as early as the Geonic 
                                time the ceremony had been transferred from the house of the parents 
                                to the synagogue, where it took place after the service in the presence 
                                of the whole congregation ' (Kohler, <I>JE</I> iv. 95). In the Congo 
                                region, on the other hand, circumcision is performed in a special 
                                hut. Previous to circumcision, various preparatory trainings, of 
                                brief duration, are often required, as among the Australians. These 
                                do not, however, materially affect the character of the rite, and 
                                come more properly under the head of initiation (q.v. ; cf. also 
                                art <FONT SIZE="2">AUSTERITIES</FONT>, particularly 2, 8 (3-4)). 
                                Except among the Jews, and possibly among the Tontonacs (in view 
                                of the fact that they circumcised in their temples), distinctly religious 
                                ceremonies in connexion with circumcision are extremely rare, being 
                                recorded only in the case of the New Caledonians and the Fijians.</P>
                              <P><A NAME="i"></A>(<I>i</I>) <B>Age when circumcision is performed.</B> -It is a significant fact that circumcision, whatever explanation 
                                may be offered for it, it is almost invariably performed before or 
                                at the age of puberty, or at latest before marriage. The sole exceptions 
                                to this rule occur among the Hebrews, where peculiar conditions caused 
                                such violation of the general principle. Abraham and his household 
                                were naturally uncircumcised until the Divine covenant had been formally 
                                instituted by God, this taking place when Abraham was 99 years old 
                                (Gn 17, 23ff; in the light of this no particular deduction can be 
                                drawn from the fact that Ishmael then happened to be 13 years of 
                                age) ; proselytes and persons inter-marrying with the Hebrews would 
                                naturally be circumcised after attaining puberty (cf. Gn 34,14ff, 
                                Ex l2,48). By far the most noteworthy passage in this connexion is 
                                Jos 5,2-9, which states that 'all the people that came out of Egypt 
                                . . .. were circumcised . but all the people that were born in the 
                                wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt, them they 
                                had not circumcised.' This younger generation Joshua circumcised 
                                after crossing the Jordan. The passage may well be taken as it stands, 
                                though the critical school seek, without due consideration of the 
                                early age at which circumcision is performed among many peoples (see 
                                below) to see in it an implication that the primitive</P>
                              <P>Hebrews practised the rite, like numerous other tribes, at the age 
                                of puberty, `the circumcision of young warriors at that age signifying 
                                the consecration of their manhood to their task as men of the covenant 
                                battling against the uncircumcised inhabitants' (Kohler, op. cit. iv. 
                                93). And the fact that even Moses neglected to circumcise his son (Ex 
                                4,25) was very probably due to his Midianitish marriage, since the 
                                Midianites, like the Sodomites apparently performed the rite shortly 
                                before marriage (see above, (<I>g</I>), and below, (<I>m</I>)(<I>o</I>)).</P>

                                enters upon a religious life. The rite is occasionally connected with 
                                the giving of a permanent name to the child, as among the Jews (cf. 
                                Lk 1, 59 - 2,21), many South Australian tribes (as the Dieri, near

                                forbidden to marry before they have been sub-incised, a rule which 
                                holds generally wherever <I>ariltha</I> is practised in Australia. 
                                women refuse to have intercourse with uncircumcised men among the 
                                Bafiote of the Loango Coast, while the Bakwiri women of Kamerun believe 
                                that physical harm would result to them from sexual relations with 
                                such men, and in Old Calabar lack of circumcision in either sex is 
                                ground for divorce. The uncircumcised are excluded from society generally 
                                by the Wanika of East Africa; and the Mombuttu, Bongo, and Mittu 
                                of Central Africa refuse to eat with those who have not been circumcised. 
                                ' Uncircumcised' is a term of insult, not only as applied to the 
                                Philistines (Jg. 14,3 15,18 1 S 17,26-36 31,4 etc.), but also among 
                                the South Australians and in Rook Island. Before circumcision a child 
                                is ritually unclean among the East African Amaxosa ; and the Masai, 
                                Wakwafi, and Kikuyu consider iron implements tabu to the uncircumcised, 
                                which, in view of the sanctity attached to this metal among primitive 
                                peoples, is certainly a significant fact.</P>
                              <P>Only after circumcision can the Malinka and Bambarra, along the 
                                upper Niger, bear arms or have a voice in the council; and not till 
                                then has a Peuhl or a Basuto the right and duty of taking part in 
                                warfare. In Kita in the French Sudan, an uncircumcised man can, it 
                                is true, bear arms, but he is debarred from all rights of inheritance; 
                                and, in like manner, inheritance is conditional on circumcision among 
                                the Masai, Wakwafi, Damara, Hambo, and Wanika; while the Damara reckon 
                                a man's age from the time of his circumcision, not counting the previous 
                                years at all. In view of all this, it is not astonishing that, just 
                                as, 'uncircumcised' is a contemptuous epithet among some peoples, 
                                as noted above, so circumcision is a mark of proud distinction among 
                                Jews, Mombuttu, etc., and is even restricted to certain classes among 
                                Aztecs, Egyptians, and Melanesians (see above, (<I>f</I>)); while, 
                                though circumcision is not universal in Madagascar, no one who has 
                                not undergone the operation can become either a soldier or an official.</P>

                                away from home, receiving instruction in all that they must henceforth 
                                observe as men ; while among the Mandingo the newly circumcised rove

                                impunity violate the usual regulation governing sexual relations

                                haughty attitude toward all others than themselves, have had to bear 
                                the brunt of opposition and ridicule because of a rite that was, 
                                to the nations surrounding them, distinctively characteristic of 
                                them ; and the , 'curti Iudaei' were the objects of the sneers of 
                                the Graeco-Roman world from Horace <I>(Sat. 1. </I>ix. 70) onward 
                                (cf. Reinach, <I>Textes d'auteurs grecs et romains relatifs au judaisme,</I> Paris, 1895). Far more serious to the Jews than mockery were the 
                                efforts made, though in vain, by Antiochus Epiphanes (1 Mac l,48 
                                60f.) and Hadrian (cf. <I>JE </I>vi. 135) to suppress circumcision, 
                                together with all other distinctive features of Judaism. The same 
                                intense hatred of circumcision is manifested by the Mandaeans, who 
                                will not admit Jews to their number, though Christians are permissible 
                                proselytes; and who, in the case of a Mandaean forcibly circumcised 
                                by Muhammadans, only with extreme reluctance received him again, 
                                condemning his descendants to perpetual isolation from their fellowship, 
                                and forbidding them to marry Mandaeans (Siouffi, <I>&Eacute;tudes

                              <P>A controversy early arose in the primitive Church, as is well known, 
                                regarding circumcision, the Hellenistic party denying its necessity, 
                                and the Judaizing faction affirming it (cf. Ac 11,2; 15,1-5; 21,21). 
                                St. Paul, however, though he himself had been circumcised and had, 
                                under Jewish pressure, performed the rite on St. Timothy (Ph 3,5;, 
                                Ac 16,3), and though he was far from depreciating it (Ro 3,1f.), decided 
                                that it was unessential, at least in the case of Gentile converts (Ac 
                                15,19ff ; cf. Gal 5,2-4). Indeed, he regarded the mere presence or 
                                absence of physical circumcision as equally immaterial (Ro 3,30f; 4,9ff 
                                - 1 Co 7,18f,- Gal 5,6 6,12ff-, Col.3,11), since the only true circumcision 
                                was spiritual (Ro 2,25ff.- Ph 3,3ff. Col 2,11ff.-), the Pauline attitude 
                                being here closely akin to that of the prophet Jeremiah (Jer 4,4 - 
                                6,10 - 9,26; cf. Dt 10,16 - 13,6). Though under divergent circumstances 
                                divergent modes of procedure might be advisable (cf. Ac 16,3 with Gal 
                                2,1ff-), St. Paul`s one principle being that he might by all means 
                                save some (1 Co 9,19ff-), he maintains that the guiding principle here 
                                must be personal honesty of conviction as to what was right for each 
                                particular individual (cf. Gal 2,11ff-&sect;), he himself feeling most keenly 
                                that he was entrusted with the, 'gospel of the uncircumcision' as St. 
                                Peter was with the gospel of the circumcision' (Gal 2,7-9).</P>
                              <P>The final victory in the struggle rested with the Gentile Christians, 
                                who advocated uncircumcision, and only one or two of the early heresies 
                                retained it. To these belong the judaistic Ebionites (see <FONT SIZE="2">EBIONISM</FONT>), 
                                who boasted of their possession of circumcision as being 'the sign

                                attitude was taken by Cerinthus (cf. the passages cited by Hilgenfeld, <I>Ketzergesh. des unchristhentums,</I>- Leipzig, 1884, p. 414), 
                                who, despite the conclusions of Peake (above, p. 320), must at least 
                                in this respect have been what he is usually considered, a Judaizing 
                                Gnostic.</P>
                              <P>In the later history of the Church, circumcision is seldom a problem. 
                                Nevertheless, the Third Council of Toledo (8 May 589) found it necessary 
                                to prohibit Jews from purchasing Christian slaves, enacting that 
                                any Jew circumcising such a slave (on the basis of Gn 17,12f-) should 
                                forfeit him ; and this canon was incorporated by Recared in the <I>Leges 
                                  Visigothorum </I>(ed. Zeumer, Hanover, 1894, p. 305 [ = xii. ii.

                                of the Roman Church on the subject is given in the bull of Eugene

                                for their time, have been abrogated by the coming of our Lord and

                              <P>But the most astonishing attack on circumcision has come from the 
                                Jews themselves. This attitude arose chiefly in connexion with the 
                                problem of the reception of proselytes. As early as the first half-century 
                                after the destruction of the Temple, the <I>tanna</I> Joshua ben 
                                Hananiah pleaded that proselytes might be exempt from the rite (<I>JE</I> x. 223) ; but the question was not broached again until 1843, when 
                                the extreme radicals of the Frankfurt 'Verein der Reformfreunde' 
                                declared circumcision optional. This naturally evoked vehement protests, 
                                even from non-conservative Jews, and for the time the movement failed. 
                                In 1869, however, the Reformed leader, Isaac M. Wise, proposed the 
                                admission of proselytes without circumcision ; and this usage, being 
                                officially sanctioned by the Central Conference of American Rabbis, 
                                held at New York in 1892, is now generally followed by Reformed synagogues 
                                (for further details, see <I>JE </I>iv. 96, 216, x. 357, 359).</P>

                                account for the origin of circumcision the most divergent theories 
                                have been proposed, some worthless, and others at least partially 
                                satisfactory. The names of the rite, so far as their etymology is 
                                clear, add little to our knowledge. Of these perhaps the most significant 
                                is the Arab. <I>hatana</I>, 'circumcise,' as compared not only witli

                                husband.' ' bridegroom,' and &sect; 'wedding' 'marriage' (see on 
                                these words above, <I>(g)</I>). The Arab. <I>tahhara</I>, 'to circumcise,' 
                                and <I>tathir</I>, 'circumcision,' however, properly mean only 'to 
                                purify' and 'purification,' which may, as Kohler (<I>op.cit</I>. 
                                p. 93) suggests, 'indicate the later religious view'. The Syr. <I>gar, </I>the ordinary verb for 'circumcise', means simply 'cut,' and rnay

                                and, when they saw that he suffered no harm, they then accepted the 
                                rite.' In this connexion, allusion may be made to a curious belief 
                                and practice, now abolished, of the Kikuyu of East Africa (Cayzac <I>Anthropos</I> v. 317). The first time that a newly circumcised 
                                youth has sexual relations with a woman, it results in the death 
                                of one or the other (on the perils of sexual intercourse according

                                (<I>k</I>) and cf. Crawley, <I>op cit., passim</I>). Accordingly 
                                those who have just undergone the rite assemble in bands of fifteen 
                                or twenty, and, surprising some old woman in a lonely place, abuse 
                                her, and finally knock out her brains with a stone, her death freeing 
                                the youths from all peril. For a like reason newly circumcised girls 
                                have intercourse with an uncircumcised child,. but this child, not 
                                being considered a human being, in not subsequently killed.</P>

                                In addition, this view is supported by the etymological connexion between <I>hatana</I> and Heb. &sect;, etc. (see preceding col.) and it is

                                to the present writer that he is incorrect in pressing Gn 34,14ff. 
                                and Ex 4,25f. in this connexion the one passage being better explicable 
                                as requiring circumcision before amalgamation (in other respects as

                                or perhaps angry, exclamation of a Midianitish woman, who was probably 
                                familiar with circumcision just before marriage, and had, perhaps, 
                                induced Moses to postpone the rite for this very reason (cf. above, 
                                (<I>g</I>)). Still less is Barton justified in explaining Jos 5,2ff. 
                                as referring to, 'the marriageable young men.' Some of these men were, 
                                indeed, doubtless just at the marriageable age ; but others (cf. vv.,5-7) 
                                must have been far beyond the age of puberty. Yet the theory is at

                              <P>The theory here considered has been learnedly advocated by Ploss <I>(op. cit. i. 368 f.)</I>, who sees in it an attempt to correct 
                                nature, and, by averting phimosis, to ensure offspring for the person 
                                operated on. The frequent performance of the rite long before puberty, 
                                he interprets as 'an effort to guarantee the child a posterity as 
                                numerous as possible (for another explanation, see below (<I>x</I>)(<I>y</I>)). 
                                The desire to correct nature receives a striking exemplification 
                                among the modern Arabs, who 'declare that only in man is an impediment

                                prominent, and may often have been the reason for the continuance 
                                of the practice,' he holds that</P>
                              <P>'the last factor in the principle . . . is one very closely connected 
                                with contact, and applies especially to such practices as circumcision. 
                                The deleterious emanation from strange or new things is identical 
                                in theory with human emanations, not only from strange or unhandselled 
                                beings, but from characteristic parts of such, and in later thought, 
                                from such parts of one's own personality. This dangerous emanation 
                                is any physical secretion religiously regarded, and its retention 
                                is prevented by cutting away separable parts which would easily harbour 
                                it. . . . This primitive notion is the same with those of personal 
                                cleanliness and of the removal of separable parts of a tabooed person. 
                                . . . When the part is cut off, there result the ideas first of securing 
                                the safety of the rest by sacrificing a part and secondly, of sacrificing 
                                such part to a deity so as to consecrate the rest, by making it less 
                                "impure" or "taboo" . . . Circumcision and artificial hymen-perforation 
                                thus originated in the intention both to obviate hylo-idealistic 
                                danger resulting from apparent closure, and, to remove a separable 
                                part of a taboo organ. . . . This removal also explains the practise 
                                of excision. The other ideas follow later, and, the safety both of 
                                the individual and of those who will have contact is the more necessary 
                                because that contact is with the other, the dangerous sex.' lt is 
                                thus that he explains the Hebrew and Egyptian view of circumcision 
                                as cleansing ; while Sir A. B. Ellis infers that circumcision amongst 
                                the Yoruba and Ewe peoples is a sacrifice of a portion of the organ, 
                                which the god [Elegbra, a phallic deity] inspires, to ensure the

                                with undoubted endurance tests (cf. above, <I>(k)</I>).</P>
                              <P>In Arabia, also, circumcision is associated with a test of endurance.

                                Abu Arish and Hejaz (described above, p. 660a). the person being 
                                operated upon is required to hold in his hand a lance, with its butt 
                                resting on his foot; he must not betray the slightest expression 
                                of pain, or allow the lance to quiver. Similar rules are found elsewhere,

                                is defended for the Hebrews, at least in part, by Barton (<I>op. cit. </I>p. 98 f.), on the basis of Gn 17,10-12, Ex 4,24f, 12,43., as being 
                                for a (or "the") token of a covenant (&sect;) between Jahweh and Abraham. 
                                To this it may well be objected that the concealment of the part of 
                                the body affected by such a mark renders this explanation improbable;

                              <P>of circumcision has operated, not only among the Hebrews, but also 
                                among many primitive peoples to produce a heightening of tribal pride

                                best to explain the American forms of circumcision, especially among 
                                the Mexicans and Mayas (see 'American' section of this art.), and 
                                has been urged for the West African Yoruba and Ewe (see above, (<I>c</I>)); 
                                while a similar view has also been advanced to account for the obscure 
                                Ex 4,24f, with the idea that the circumcision of Gershom ransomed 
                                either his life or that of his father, Moses, from the wrath of Jahweh. 
                                And Barton <I>(op. cit. </I>p. 100; below, p. 679; cf. Jeremias, 
                                in Chantepie de la Saussaye, <I>Lehrb. der Religionsgesch.', </I>Tubingen, 
                                1905, i. 381) holds that the circumstances under which the rite 'is 
                                performed in Arabia point to the origin of circumcision as a sacrifice 
                                to the goddess of fertility by which the child was placed under her 
                                protection, and its reproductive powers consecrated to her service.' 
                                The mere fact, however, that sacrifice is offered in Arabia in connexion 
                                with circumcision scarcely warrants us in assuming that the rite 
                                itself (except in America) is sacrificial in origin. Lagrange, in 
                                his &Eacute; tude sur les religions s&eacute;metiques (Paris, 1905), 
                                modifies this theory by making, circumcision a sacrifice of a part 
                                to save the whole an explanation which is not altogether convincing.

                                glans among the Tongans and other Polynesians. The theory has met 
                                with little favour, being deemed too artificial (cf. Ploss <I>op. 
                                  cit.</I> i 370 f.) yet it must be remembered that the genitals are 
                                distinctly recognised as sacred among at least some peoples. Only 
                                thus can he explain the early Hebrew rite of swearing with the 'hand 
                                under the thigh' of the person to whom the oath is made (Gn24,2. 
                                9. 47,29) this part of the body being known to be that from which 
                                life proceeds (cf. Gn 35,11 46,26</P>
                              <P>Ex 1,5, Jg 8,30, 1 K 8,19). And it may be suggested that a similar 
                                feeling of sanctity was, at least in some cases, one of the factors, 
                                that led to the almost universal tabu laid upon the genitals, of 
                                both sexes (though especially of women, where the sense of property 
                                rights (see art. <FONT SIZE="2">ADULTERY</FONT>) also played an

                                at least, a custom introduced from other tribes; (cf. the Basuto 
                                legend quoted above, p. 664b) was adopted first, as new fashions 
                                generally are by the higher classes, and then was gradually extended 
                                till, it became universal among the people concerned. On this theory, 
                                the curious exemption of the highest chief in Tonga from the rite 
                                (above,<I> </I>(<I>f</I>)) would be explained by the theory that 
                                he was too august to be subject to alien customs. But this phenomenon 
                                in extremely rare, and there in absolutely no reason to suppose that 
                                circumcision was primarily restricted to any one class. Its performance

                                and the similar phenomenon in Africa, as well as the express command 
                                in Gn. 17,10-14 34,14ff, Ex 12,48, all militate against such a hypothesis.</P>

                                and Maimonides (<I>More Nebuchim</I>, xlix. 391 f.) maintained that 
                                the object of circumcision was to check lust, Burton <I>(Mem. of 
                                  the Anthropolog. Soc.</I>i. 318) put forth the theory that 'removal 
                                of the prepuce blunts the sensitivity of the penis and protracts 
                                the act of Venus.' This remarkable explanation can scarcely be taken 
                                seriously (for a much more plausible reverse reason, to discourage 
                                onanism, see above (<I>a</I>)), though it was alleged by a native 
                                to be the reason for the semi-<I>ariltha </I> practised along the 
                                north-west coast of Australia (Milucho-Maclay, <I>ZE</I>, 1880, p. 
                                87). While the general attitude of Australians toward their women 
                                is scarcely such as to make this tender consideration of their feelings 
                                probable, such may, nevertheless, be a partial motive in regions 
                                where greater refinement (or perhaps degeneracy) exists. This in, 
                                according to Ploss <I>(Das Weib-9, </I>i. 569 f.), the reason for 
                                the pinching off of a part of the prepuce in the Aarau Archipelago 
                                and in Seranglao (<I>cf.</I> above, (<I>b</I>)).</P>
                              <P> With this Ploss compares the Dayak use of piercing the <I>glans</I> with a silver needle, and, after the wound heals, of inserting in

                                sometimes being perforated at both ends for little bundles of bristles.

                                though the present writer is not convinced that it is wholly satisfactory.</P>
                              <P>'If' writes Frazer,'as seems highly probable, such a custom as that 
                                recorded by the tradition ever prevailed, its intention could hardly 
                                be any other than that of securing the future birth and re-incarnation 
                                of the owner of the foreskin when he should have died and his spirit 
                                returned to its abode in the tree.... lt might well be thought that 
                                a man's new birth would be facilitated, it in his lifetime he could 
                                lay up a stock of vital energy for the use of his disembodied spirit 
                                after death. That he did, apparently, by detaching a vital portion 
                                of himself, namely, the foreskin, and depositing it in his <I>nanja</I> tree or rock, or whatever it might be' (211 f.) In <I>ariltha</I> (see 
                                below, (<I>z</I>)), likewise, 'this strengthening and fertilizing virtue 
                                of the blood was applied, like the foreskin at circumcision, to lay 
                                up a store of energy in the <I>nanja</I> spot, against the time when 
                                the man's feeble ghost would need it .... That portion, whether the 
                                foreskin or the blood, was, in a manner, seed sown in order to grow 
                                up and provide his immortal spirit with a new body when his old body 
                                had mouldered in the dust ... the removal of a vital part of the person 
                                which shall serve as a link between two successive incarnations, by 
                                preparing for the novice a new body to house his spirit when its present 
                                tabernacle shall have been worn out' (214). in this connexion Frazer 
                                calls attention to Ezk. 32,19. 21 24f. (cf. also Ezk. 28,10 31,18), 
                                although these passages do not necessarily imply that the uncircumcised 
                                were debarred from resurrection, while the circumcised might again 
                                come to life (for folk-tales of the 'renewal of life in the dismembered

                                of Herbert Spencer (cited by Jacobs <I>JE </I>iv. 98), that circumcision 
                                'was a mark of subjection introduced by conquering warriors to supersede 
                                the punishment of death,' hardly deserves mention, much less discussion.</P>

                                majority of cases circumcision is, as the examples collected above 
                                imply, and as Jacobs <I>(op. cit.) </I>concludes, initiatory in character. 
                                In this way the theories that it is a preparation for sexual life, 
                                an effort to avert sexual peril, a test of endurance, and a tribal 
                                mark (above, (<I>o</I>)(<I>p</I>)(<I>q</I>)(<I>y</I>)) are all seen 
                                to be part truths, since all these factors, and more besides, are 
                                necessary for the complete life of manhood. It is, then, but natural 
                                that the rite should normally be performed about the age of puberty. 
                                At the same time, since the rite must be performed some time, it 
                                appears that, for various reasons (chiefly, perhaps, the realization 
                                that circumcision becomes more painful, and even more dangerous, 
                                the longer it is postponed), the operation frequently takes place 
                                long before puberty, and even, as among the Hebrews, Wazegua, Ovaherero, 
                                and others (for examples, see above, <I>(i)</I>, in tender infancy 
                                (for another explanation of early circumcision, see above, <I>(b)</I>). 
                                It is, as Andree <I>(op. cit. </I>p. 75) rightly says, 'most usually 
                                a socio-political act, performed at the age of puberty' (on the religious-problems 
                                involved see conclusion).</P>

                                called 'artificial hypospadias,' has already been described (above, <I>(b)</I>), as has Frazer's explanation of it (above, (<I>w</I>)) 
                                It was formerly held, largely on the authority of Milucho-Maclay-(cf. 
                                Ploss, <I>Das Kind2</I>, i. 358 f., ii. 422 f.), that the object of 
                                this operation was Malthusian, since the ejection of semen, taking 
                                place immediately in front of the scrotum, was so that the few men 
                                unoperated on were believed to procreate the entire offspring of the 
                                tribe. These conclusions are now known to be wrong.</P>
                              <P>In the first place, 'the natives, one and all in these tribes, believe 
                                that the child is the direct result of the entrance into the mother 
                                of an ancestral spirit individual. They have no idea of procreation 
                                as being directly associated with sexual intercourse [see art. <FONT SIZE="2">CHASTITY</FONT>, 
                                p. 479b), and firmly believe that children can be born without this 
                                taking place' (Spencer-Gillen b, p. 330). In the second place, the 
                                Australian mode of coitus (Roth, <I>op. cit.</I> p. 179) in which the 
                                man squats on his haunches, drawing the supine woman toward him, does 
                                secure the discharge of the semen into its natural receptacle.</P>
                              <P>It may perhaps be hesitatingly suggested, in lack of any better 
                                explanation, that the operation is designed to make the male genitals

                                  pudendorum</I>, the flaps of <I>corpus spongiosum</I> to the <I>labia</I> etc., while micturation is performed of necessity in the female position. 
                                This explanation is the reverse of that suggested by Roth (see below, 
                                3(l)) and bears a certain amount of analogy, with the 'effeminates'of 
                                many American Indian tribes, who, after suffering atrophy of the 
                                genitals through excessive masturbation, etc., dress as women, and 
                                conduct themselves as such (cf. Waitz, Anthropol. der Naturv&ouml;lker, 
                                iii. 113, 383; Fewkes in 25 <I>RBEW</I>, 1907, p. 31 ; <I>NR, passim</I>;

                                operations performed in Fiji, at various ages, and sometimes repeatedly 
                                on the same individual, are declared to be strictly therapeutic in 
                                intention (de Marzan, <I>Anthropos</I> v. 808 f.).</P>

                                as a whole leads the present writer, at least, to conclude that there 
                                is no one cause that will satisfactorily account fur every phase of 
                                the rite. One argument, and only one, of those cited above may be ruled 
                                out at once as worthless-the idea that circumcision was a mark of subjection 
                                (<I>x</I>). Two others, that it was a mark of social distinction (<I>u</I>), 
                                and that it was designed to increase sexual pleasure (<I>v</I>), may 
                                explain a very few instances. The plea that it was hygienic (<I>n</I>) 
                                can, even if found empirically to be true, scarcely have been the original 
                                motive - the Egyptians, in their report to Herodotus, were too civilized 
                                to serve as credible narrators of primitive usage, even if they were 
                                not giving a rational-</P>

                              <P>istic interpretation which would commend itself to a foreign traveller 
                                (and the same thing may possibly hold of the Samoans). the hypothesis 
                                that re-incarnation was aided by circumcision (<I>w</I>) explains 
                                one curious tradition, and is not without analogous ideas elsewhere; 
                                but that it accounts for the rite as a whole seems very doubtful. 
                                The theory of sacrifice (<I>s</I>), from which may have developed 
                                that of sanctification of the reproductive powers and their tabu 
                                (<I>t</I>), even as the concepts of preparation for sexual life, 
                                obviation of sexual danger, endurance tests, and tribal marks (<I>o</I>)(<I>p</I>)(<I>q</I>)(<I>y</I>)

                                been a factor, if not the factor, among some peoples. And among the 
                                Hebrews the rite may have had the meaning of the sanctification of 
                                the reproductive organs to Jahweh, 'He who causes to be' (on the 
                                etymology of &sect;, cf. Barton <I>op. cit.</I> pp. 282-285 ; see 
                                also Kittel, in <I>PRE </I> viii. 533 ff., and the literature cited 
                                in <I>Oxf. Heb. Lex. </I>p. 218), as well as of initiation into the 
                                Hebrew community (cf. Gn 17,10ff. Ex 12,48 and perhaps Gn 34,14ff, 
                                though the last passage might be explained, on a strained hypothesis 
                                as a ruse of the sons of Jacob to get the Shechemites into their 
                                power). From this point of view, the Hebrews would have had the most 
                                perfect idea of circumcision, as including both the great sources-sanctification 
                                of the sexual organs, and initiation.</P>
                              <P>It is even possible that, despite the variety of motives to which 
                                reference has already been made, all kinds of circumcision are ultimately 
                                reducible, not to two causes (sacrifice or sanctification of the 
                                reproductive faculties and initiation), but to one, sacrifice; since 
                                initiation, with its accompanying austerities, may conceivably be 
                                regarded as itself a sacrifice to the tribal deity to gain admission 
                                to the people whom he protects.</P>
                              <P>Is circumcision a religious rite? This is denied, except in sporadic 
                                instances, by Andree <I>(op. cit.</I> p. 75), and attention has already 
                                been called (above, (<I>h</I>) to the extreme rarity of specifically 
                                religious rites in connexion with circumcision. Much depends, of 
                                course, on one's definition of religion ; but, in view of the fact 
                                that among most primitive peoples religion is practically co-extensive 
                                with life, and still more in consideration of the ceremonies, such 
                                as feasts and the like, connected with the performance of the rite, 
                                the present writer strongly feels that in its inception, and late 
                                into its development, circumcision was essentially religious. This 
                                is self evident among those peoples where circumcision is regarded 
                                either as a sacrifice or as sanctification of the genital organs 
                                (above, (<I>s</I>)(<I>t</I>)). The religious explanation also seems 
                                to hold good if circumcision is considered as preparation for sexual 
                                life, as obviation of the perils connected with sexual union, or 
                                as initiation in general (above, (<I>o</I>)(<I>p</I>)(<I>y</I>)) 
                                the three reasons for which, ostensibly at least, it is most generally 
                                performed. For to the primitive mind all matters connected with the 
                                reproductive functions and with their operations and results are 
                                essentially connected will religion, as Crawley has shown in his <I>Mystic Rose</I>; and all rites of initiation are likewise primarily 
                                religious (see <FONT SIZE="2">INITIATION</FONT>). If, as tentatively 
                                suggested above, even initiation in ultimately to be traced back 
                                to sacrifice, the religious origin of circumcision would be beyond 
                                question. Despite the lack of rites specifically declared to be religious 
                                in the majority of cases of circumcision, therefore, its origin seems 
                                to the present writer to be, under any hypothesis, religious; while 
                                survivals or primitive religious concepts are preserved even among 
                                peoples to whom the religious aspects of circumcision have become 
                                more or less blurred.</P>
                              <P>It is difficult, and perhaps over-subtle in consideration of the 
                                mental equipment of primitive</P>

                              <P>man, to deduce all circumcision from any single cause, it is impossible 
                                to derive it from any one centre. The attempt was, indeed, made by 
                                R. Hartmann <I>(V&ouml;lker Afrika's, </I>Leipzig, 1879, p. 178), 
                                who held that circumcision originated in Africa, whence it spread, 
                                through the Egyptians, to the Semites and to Asia. Borrowing is, 
                                of course, found among some peoples (see above, pp. 661, 664), and 
                                may well have been more prevalent than is generally known (that the 
                                Africans have been widely influenced in this respect by Muhammadanism 
                                is obvious); yet the possibility of independent origin and of various 
                                reasons must also be reckoned with. That such independent development 
                                actually took place is proved beyond all doubt by the existence of 
                                circumcision in America and Australia, where no sane person would 
                                allege African influence.</P>

                                is available for ethnological consideration, most of it being concerned 
                                either with the surgical or the Hebrew aspects , and no small amount 
                                being superficial defences of wild and morbid theories. A considerable 
                                quantity of the older material is collected in Waitz-Gerland, Anthropol.

          male circumcision. Most of the literature shows no awareness 
          of phimosis - its frequency - or the sexual and erectile problems which can be cured by circumcision. If routine circumcision 
          had been introduced for this most obvious reason of eliminating difficult 
          foreskins; then the importance of an alternative modern method, suitable to our culture's attitudes in this day and age, would be clear. </FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                                stainless ball bearings are inserted into the cuts in the glans instead. 
                                These are then stitched so that the ball bearings remain forever as 
  "lumps" This tradition therefore is also contemporary.&quot; (from <A HREF="http://www.angelfire.com/in2/africansex"

                                a bit of stick is used as a probe, and carried round and round between 
                                the glans and prepuce, to ascertain the exact extent of the frenum, 
                                and that no unnatural adhesions exist.&quot; <A HREF="../library/xtras/refs.html#ref60">(60)</A></P>

                                that this is a traditional and accepted practice in Indian medicine. 
                                Why has Indian medicine developed a probe check, unless it was very 
                                common and somehow accepted to have a phimosis . . . ?</P>
                              <P>The Hindu religion apparently disallows circumcision, &quot;. .

                                  <B>SUBINCISION</B><BR>
                                Among the Australian aborigines and some tribes of New Guinea, there 
                                is an operation called subincision &quot;Subincision (opening the 
                                urethra, along the inferior surface of the penis)&quot; <A HREF="../library/xtras/refs.html#ref74">(74)</A> &quot;varying from a little over a half an inch in some cases, to 
                                a gash opening up almost the whole of the penis . . in others.&quot; <A HREF="../library/xtras/refs.html#ref75">(75)</A></P>

                                  <B>INFIBULATION</B><BR>
                                The Greeks and the Romans used to practice infibulation, this involves 
                                giving oneself an artificial phimosis <A HREF="../library/xtras/refs.html#ref57">(57)</A>. 
                                Related practices exist among Chinese and Indian mystics. In his 
                                journals, Cook remarks that the Maoris were accustomed to tie up 
                                the prepuce in order to make it cover the glans <A HREF="../library/xtras/refs.html#ref76">(76)</A>. 
                                It should come as no surprise to us that this was also practiced 
                                in New Guinea.</P>

                                Purely out of interest in the creativity of some of these ancient 
                                operations, consider &quot;the Dayak usage of piercing the glans 
                                with a silver needle, and after the wound heals, of inserting in 
                                it small rods of brass, ivory, silver, or bamboo, the silver rods 
                                sometimes being perforated at both ends for little bundles of bristles.&quot; <A HREF="../library/xtras/refs.html#ref51">(51)</A>.</P>

                                since the early 1930's have been mostly Catholic. They do still mostly

                              <P>I met a man many years ago from Madagascar, raised in a village 
                                where his father had seven wives. He was one of 28 of his fathers children, 
                                he related that most of the boys of about 15 would all be circumcised 
                                in August in a big &quot;public&quot; gathering, if one yelled out 
                                it would disgrace the father. They also stuck a stick thru the penis 
                                right behind the glans and this stayed with them and was supposed to 
                                'help' in satisfying the women. He was grateful that he survived after 
                                the ceremony and that his stick had come out on its own, (apparently 
                                if it came out, that was not considered bad), but he had an awful scar 
                                from both the rough cut circumcision and the wound where the stick 
                                had been pushed thru. He had no idea as to why it was done, only that 
                                he intended to live in UK until after sons were born and have them 
                                circ'd in a hospital where the danger and pain was not so severe.</P>

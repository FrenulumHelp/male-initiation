          male circumcision. Most of the literature shows no awareness 
          of phimosis - its frequency - or the sexual and erectile problems which can be cured by circumcision. If routine circumcision 
          had been introduced for this most obvious reason of eliminating difficult 
          foreskins; then the importance of an alternative modern method, suitable to our culture's attitudes in this day and age, would be clear. </FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P><B>FRENULUM OF THE PENIS</B> <I>Anat. & Surg. </I> it is thus, that one names the small cutaneous ligament which attaches the prepuce under 
                                the glans. Its structure appears fairly similar to that of the membrane 
                                under the tongue; however in addition to this it swells up, & stiffens. 
                                Its extreme sensitivity shows that it must be covered with a quantity 
                                of nervous papillae; & perhaps for these reasons it merits more attention 
                                on behalf of the anatomists than they have given it up until present; 
                                moreover it is exposed to the flippances of nature, and these demand 
                                surgical remedies. 
                              <P> It is so short among some people, that it is necessary to cut it 
                                in order that these people are in a position to fulfill the goal of 
                                marriage:

                              <P> In others, the frenulum extends up to the urine channel; so that 
                                during the forceful movements of love, the rigid penis is pulled downwards 
                                by this bridle, & bends very painfully in the form of an arc: 
                              <P> this second eventuality requires the same operation; it must be 
                                performed with care and attention, & all the necessary precautions 
                                so as not to wound the glans: the treatment must avoid the coherance 
                                of the wound with the prepuce. 
                              <P> Tyson reports having been not only obliged to sometimes cut the 
                                frenulum of the penis because it was too short, or because it was too 
                                long, but also of having done this in some subjects, following a scar 
                                that venereal ulcers had there left. (D.J.) 
                              <P> TWENTY FIFTH VOLUME - p. 644-645 
                              <P><B>PHIMOSIS, </B> this is an ailment of the penis, in which the 
                                prepuce is stuck & tightly closed around the glans; in a manner that 
                                one cannot draw it backwards to uncover the glans. see. <FONT SIZE="2">GLANS. 
                                  PREPUCE.</FONT> This word is Greek; it correctly means tying with a 
                                string, -<I>Greek word</I>-, meaning <I>bond made with a cord</I>. 
                              <P> Sometimes a <I>phimosis</I> hides ulcers which are on the glans 
                                or around it. It is sometimes so virulent, that it leads to inflammation 
  & finally gangrene in this part. 
                              <P> One distinguishes between a natural phimosis & an accidental phimosis. 
                                The natural comes from birth; usually it is not at all dangerous, unless 
                                an inflammation occurs there due to acrimony of the urine remaining 
                                between the glans & the prepuce for a long time. 
                              <P> The accidental phimosis can be benign or malignant. The first originates 
                                from something external irritating the prepuce, which becomes inflammed 
  & swells & tightens so much that a circular rim is formed at its end 
                                which prevents this from being reversed to uncover the glans. 
                              <P> The malignant phimosis is similar to this; but a venereal virus 
                                is identified as the cause ; it often occurs with gonorrhea, ulcers; 
  & with other venereal diseases which infect the prepuce. 
                              <P> Natural phimosis can require an operation even without an inflammation 
                                occurring there. If the opening of the prepuce does not correspond 
                                precisely to the opening of the urethra, the urine is not able to exit 
                                in a continuous jet, but gets trapped between the glans & the prepuce. 
                                Lack of care in such cases have often given place to the collection 
                                of urine, & consequently to the formation of stones in this area. 
                              <P> If one takes care to press the prepuce after one has urinated one 
                                can avoid this disadvantage, however it is felt, that such people are 
                                not in the position to have children, because the the seminal fluid 
                                would suffer the same fate as the urine. 
                              <P> A small incision of the prepuce on one side of the penis, will 
                                give the facility to uncover the opening of the urethra, & remove the 
                                obstacles which hinder ejaculation. 
                              <P> A small steel instrument has been invented to dilate a prepuce 
                                which is too narrow. The former end is put in the hole of the prepuce, 
  & one dilates the branches, by loosening the screw between them. 
                              <P> When the phimosis is accidental, it is necessary to bleed the patient 
                                depending on the nature & progress of the inflammation, to make palliative 
                                injections between the prepuce & the glans, to apply pain-killing & 
                                resolvent poultices, while observing the placement of the penis; which 
                                must be lying on the stomach, for the reasons which we explain regarding <FONT SIZE="2">PARAPHIMOSIS</FONT>: it is only after employing all 
                                these methods without success, that it is necessary to consider an 
                                operation. 
                              <P> Chirurg: The patient may sit in an armchair... The surgeon takes 
                                the penis in his left hand... The perfection of the operation of phimosis 
                                consists in cutting equally the skin & also the internal membrane of 
                                the prepuce... (Y)
                              <P> TWENTY FOURTH VOLUME - p. 73-74 
                              <P> <B>PARAPHIMOSIS, </B>is an ailment of the penis, in which the prepuce 
                                is inverted & inflated so securely behind the glans that it is no longer 
                                able to cover it. see<FONT SIZE="2"> PREPUCE. GLANS. </FONT>
                              <P> This word is Greek, composed of multum, much, & of obligo, constringo: 
                                tie up, constrict, because the paraphimosis clenches the penis as if 
                                it is tied. 
                              <P> This inconvenience is often a symptom of venereal disease. It can 
                                occur accidentally when the prepuce is naturally narrow, & when one 
                                forcefully pulls it behind the crown of the glans ; from whence the 
                                width prevents the prepuce from subsiding & recovering the end of the 
                                penis. 
                              <P> This often happens with children whose glans had not ever yet been 
                                uncovered, & who, from creativity & curiosity, have retracted their 
                                prepuce by force. 
                              <P> This also happens to newly married men, who make the attempt to 
                                deflower the young girls who they have married. Dionis says that he 
                                reduced a young man's paraphimosis which happened to him on the day 
                                of his marriage, &, who accused his wife of having given him this venereal 
                                problem. The author comforted this young man a great deal, by telling 
                                him everything which could possibly reconcile him to the pain which 
                                his wife had been able to save him, if she had been less wise. 
                              <P> Chirurg.; There are various methods of reducing the prepuce, according 
                                to the circumstances. If the prepuce has not strangled the glans for 
                                a long time ... initially one sprays cold water...or one soaks these 
                                parts in a vessel ... If the inflammation has reached a certain point...he 
                                then has need of the surgeons hands ... He takes the penis between 
                                the two index fingers between the two hands, the backs of which show 
                                towards the patient's stomach & he moves the prepuce over the glans, 
                                which is compressed laterally with the two thumbs to stretch it out 
                                ...... If the inflammation is large, it will be necessary to make an 
                                incision on the internal membrane of the prepuce, to eliminate the 
                                strangulation. .... (Y)

                              <P> Doctor Drake observes that in none of the works of nature does 
                                one see as many variations as in the prepuce; & that among different 
                                men, the shape & the proportion there is always completely different. 
                              <P> It is more than apparent that the development of circumcision, 
                                practised so universally throughout the East, is necessary to consider 
                                less as an act of religion<B>,</B> but as a means of keeping the part 
                                clean, & of eliminating the diseases which originate in these regions 
                                due to the retention of mucosity which is provided by glands which 
                                are underneath the prepuce ; 
                              <P> & the same author adds that he saw Orientals, who having large 
                                inflated prepuces, were frightened to see a mucosity seeping out, which 
                                undoubtedly would not have been there, except that it built up between 
                                the prepuce & the glans; & it is without doubt this disadvantage among 
                                others, that the divine legislator of the Jews wished to prevent, by 
                                making the law of circumcision. see <FONT SIZE="2">CIRCUMCISION</FONT>.* 
                              <P> The skin of the prepuce is double: at the place where the inner 
                                skin joins with the other parts, there are a number of oval or almost 
                                round glands, placed irregularly around the union of the glans with 
                                the corpus cavernosum, & on the glans itself. 
                              <P> Their use is to filter a liquid which eases the movement of the 
                                prepuce on the glans. When this liquid becomes rancid from old age, 
                                or following a venereal ailment, the glans grazes the prepuce; & even 
                                sometimes tightens the latter, so much so that it is sometimes necessary 
                                to make an incision there to uncover the glans. See <FONT SIZE="2">PHIMOSIS 
  & PARAPHIMOSIS. </FONT>
                              <P> This loose fold of penile skin which one names prepuce & which 
                                usually embraces the base of the glans, is sometimes attached to it 
                                owing to malformation; & this cohesion demands all the dexterity of 
                                a skilful operator in order to avoid wounding the prepuce & the glans. 
                              <P> Another malformation is sometimes the end of the prepuce is so 
                                narrow that it is neither possible to urinate without pain, nor to 
                                be able to uncover the glans in any manner. 
                              <P> At other times the prepuce is very elongated beyond the glans, 
  & this elongation is so narrow that in addition to the problems of 
                                urination, a certain quantity of urine always remains there, retained 
                                between this elongation of the prepuce & glans, as in a small tank, 
                                it then runs out by itself little by little; or by pressing the extremities 
                                of the prepuce; these two natural forms of phimosis can be cured by 
                                circumcision. 
                              <P> Palsyn reports having seen a 70 year old man with a phimosis accompanied 
                                by a small stone which was placed between the glans & the prepuce, 
                                directly infront of the opening of the urethra; so that each time he 
                                wanted to urinate, the patient was obliged to move the small stone 
                                with a suitable instrument, from the front of the opening of the urethra. 
                                He had tolerated his discomfort for nearly fourty years, during which 
                                time he had ejected several small stones. He was cured by the operation. 
                              <P> The same Palsyn reports having seen another 60 year old man, who 
                                had a natural phimosis, & a very long prepuce; in addition he had many 
                                problems urinating, a portion of urine always remained between the 
                                glans & the prepuce, it was retained there as if in a purse, leaking 
                                imperceptibly in his breeches; it was necessary to relieve him of this 
                                inconvenience by a circumcision. 
                              <P> It is believed that the Turks & several other peoples, where circumcision 
                                is practised, would have a too long prepuce, if one would not have 
                                the precaution of cutting it.. Boulaye says that he saw in the deserts 
                                of Mesopatania & Arabia along the rivers of the Tiger & Euphrates, 
                                a quantity of little Arab boys, who had a prepuce which was so long, 
                                that he thought that, without the help of circumcision these people 
                                would be incompetent in marriage. 
                              <P> Finally sometimes children are born without any opening in the 
                                prepuce; in this case, it is necessary to immediately make a suitable 
                                small incision there, which one then bandages with a piece of linen.

          male circumcision. Most of the literature shows no awareness 
          of phimosis - its frequency - or the sexual and erectile problems which can be cured by circumcision. If routine circumcision 
          had been introduced for this most obvious reason of eliminating difficult 
          foreskins; then the importance of an alternative modern method, suitable to our culture's attitudes in this day and age, would be clear. </FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P>... Interest in the foreskin, foreskin-related problems and solutions 
                                to them have existed for a long time. <A HREF="diderot.html#start">Diderot's 
                                  Grande Encyclopedie</A>, published some 240-odd years ago, has an 
                                entry entitled Prepuce that, like much else in the Encyclopedie is 
                                enlightening. It states that the foreskin is the most variable organ 
                                in man, an observation that could be made in a country and time when 
                                all men had foreskins. Somewhere on your page is a comparison of 
                                the foreskin with the vermiform appendix, and I think it's an apt 
                                observation. 
                              <P>The point has been made somewhere that circumcision wouldn't have 
                                been invented if there were no use for it, and I think that point too 
                                is valid. Parts of the world where it has been practiced tend to be 
                                hot areas where water is often in short supply: Egypt, Pacific coastal 
                                Peru, and Australia, among others. Your point as to the usefulness 
                                of dorsal slit as a substitute for (or precursor to) circumcision is 
                                well taken, but you're not strictly correct when you state that dorsal 
                                slit is &quot;simply unheard of.&quot;</P>
                              <P>Dorsal slit is not totally ignored, but I think it was more common 
                                in the USA a couple of generations ago. It's long been called &quot;the 
                                French cut&quot; by American physicians in the apparent belief that 
                                the French perform it in preference to circumcision where they consider 
                                intervention to be necessary. (I don't know if this belief is true; 
                                perhaps you, located in Europe, can make a better determination of 
                                its accuracy.)</P>
                              <P>A group of nude men with dorsal slits are quite unmistakable on 
                                an early Egyptian bas relief. (Of course, full circumcisions are recognisable 
                                in many examples of Egyptian art.) For hundreds of years dorsal slit 
                                was practiced by millions in Indonesia, Malaysia, and parts of the 
                                Philippines until the recent invention of the Tara clamp. Thor Heyerdahl 
                                (Ancient Man and the Sea) says dorsal slit is the &quot;circumcision&quot; 
                                traditionally practiced in the Pacific by many Polynesians and other 
                                islanders. 
                              <P>Between World Wars I and II it was done on a lot of kids born in 
                                the Orlando, Florida area. I went to school with some of these guys, 
                                and all of them appeared content with their lot. One of my roommates 
                                who I could see had a dorsal slit was convinced he was circumcised, 
                                and I didn't dispute his belief. I think the chief reason dorsal slit 
                                was more or less abandoned in the USA was the appearance of the Gomco 
                                clamp and the Plastibell, both of which made a total circumcision nearly 
                                as easy to perform as a dorsal slit, even by a less-than-skilled surgeon.</P>
                              <P>In regard to complaints that the dorsally slit penis is less aesthetically 
                                appealing than the circumcised, this may be questionable judging from 
                                the fair number I've observed (though it would be presumptuous for 
                                me to set myself up as an arbiter of penile beauty!). When the procedure 
                                is done on a young patient, however, the separate flaps of foreskin 
                                tend upon healing to more or less disappear behind and beneath the 
                                glans so that although obviously still there, the remaining foreskin 
                                is out of the way and not conspicuous. It totally disappears upon erection, 
                                so the penis appears identical with one that was circumcised. Your 
                                (Robin Stuart) point that dorsal slit can be done to eliminate foreskin 
                                problems and can always be followed later by circumcision if the owner 
                                of the dorsally slit penis so desires, is well taken.</P>
                              <P>... a couple of Texas paediatricians (Diaz, A. and H. I. Kantor, 
                                1971. Dorsal slit, a circumcision alternative. Obstet. Gynecol. 37:619-622.) 
                                These doctors told the mothers whose kids they were treating that this 
                                was a &quot;new kind of circumcision,&quot; which it definitely is 
                                not. They reported some follow-up on their first patients, but I don't 
                                know what has happened with dorsal slit in Texas since their work. 
                                If I were king of the world, however, I think I would decree that all 
                                newborn boys (except Jewish and Muslim kids, whose penile destiny is 
                                already determined) would be given a dorsal slit by a competent surgeon. 
                                If this were done, there would be no more routine neonatal circumcision, 
                                but also there would be no more problems with adhesions, phimosis and 
                                the like which the anti-circ boys (and girls!) claim don't exist. And 
                                I submit that a lot of human suffering (and hopefully also impassioned, 
                                ill-mannered contention!) would thereupon disappear from the earth....</P>
                              <P>... A dorsal slit at birth is a small price to pay to prevent these 
                                needless problems. ...</P>
                              <P>... All this talk has reminded me of a man, born in Washington State 
                                about the time WWII began (and thus now about 60 years old), who was 
                                not circed but shortly after birth had a tiny snippet (no more than 
                                1/2 cm) of the foreskin slit open on top of his penis at the tip end. 
                                The slit was inconspicuous and hardly visible at very close range. 
                                At the same time he made the tiny cut the doctor had apparently also 
                                separated all of the internal foreskin from the glans and frenum with 
                                a blunt probe. The result was that the foreskin was completely free 
                                so that the glans became fully exposed whenever the penis was erect, 
                                but when flaccid the glans was fully covered and it was obvious that 
                                the penis was &quot;normal&quot; and was not circumcised. 
                              <P>Since erections are pretty common in growing boys and young men, 
                                smegma and dirt never had a chance to accumulate under the foreskin 
                                on the glans, and his penis stayed remarkably clean. As he grew up 
                                I doubt that he was ever aware of any foreskin problem, and certainly 
                                nobody could have convinced him that circumcision was a real need. 
                                I envy him because with a minimum of trauma he was freed at birth from 
                                any difficulties with his penis and any accompanying pain and embarrassment 
                                that many kids with phimosis &amp; short frenulum have experienced. 
                                I don't know how the doctor who delivered him arrived at awareness 
                                of this minimally traumatic, highly conservative procedure, but I think 
                                if it were applied worldwide the question of ric or other bizarre penile 
                                treatments would never arise. And we'd all be better off for it! (Whether 
                                most frenular abnormalities could be relieved by similar conservative 
                                treatment shortly after birth I don't know, but have a strong feeling 
                                [not firm knowledge] that they could be.)</P></TD>

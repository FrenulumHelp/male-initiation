        <P><FONT SIZE="2">Experts have been unable to understand the origin of the practice of routine 
          male circumcision. Most of the literature shows no awareness 
          of phimosis - its frequency - or the sexual and erectile problems which can be cured by circumcision. If routine circumcision 
          had been introduced for this most obvious reason of eliminating difficult 
          foreskins; then the importance of an alternative modern method, suitable to our culture's attitudes in this day and age, would be clear. </FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

        <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>Circumcision</B></P>
        <P>Only the circumcised man or warrior (<I>Moran</I>), as he is called 
          among the herding peoples, can enjoy full freedom of movement and trade, 
          a freedom which he uses especially in service of the erotic Uncircumcised, 
          he may not and is not allowed to marry, among the herding and hunting 
          peoples the same applies to the bride. Only after circumcision will 
          she be declared by the society as adult and sexually mature. Therefore 
          among African folk, the boy and girl long for nothing more than to have 
          the circumcision ritual behind them because it constitutes a milestone 
          for them in the social standing between two stages in life.</P>
        <P>The boy (<I>Layoni</I>) becomes man (<I>Mureniu</I>); the girl (<I>Kyepta</I>) 
          becomes woman (<I>Osotya</I>). They become new people. Nick names und 
          childhood names are no more appropriate, from now on the new name they 
          receive stays with them till the end of their lives, (Nandi.)</P>
        <P> Despite the wide spread practice of circumcision by most peoples <FONT SIZE="2"><I>(in 
          Africa RS)</I></FONT>, nothing defintate is known about the origin of 
          this practice. When anyone is asked about this, they reply either &quot;<I> 
          zamani</I>!"(1) (with a very long drawn out emphasis on "<I>ma</I>"), 
          which means as much as &quot;since ancient times&quot;; or he answers 
          that it is just merely a custom. Both of these are not explanations.<BR>
          <FONT SIZE="2">1)&#9;A word taken out of the Arabic from the Swahili 
          language. </FONT></P>
        <P>Concerning the origin of female circumcision among the Nandi it was 
          frequently explained to me that the children of the uncircumcised die. 
          However this is as a logical conclusion of the existing inhuman practice 
          whereby children of uncircumcised girls are strangled. Thus also it 
          is not an explanation.</P>
        <P>Concerning my questions on female circumcision, a Nandi Chieftan gave 
          me the following answer: "We are Nandi, we do not want anything hanging 
          from the women!", With this he made a contemptuous gesticulation 
          with his little finger as if he wanted to indicate the clitoris. Without 
          any doubt the men and women from the tribes in question consider the 
          circumcised sexual organs as beautiful. The circumcised as well as those 
          not yet circumcised repeatedly assured me of this. However highly one 
          may estimate the wish for beauty among African races, it appears to 
          me that this would not be so strong enough to imagine that the origin 
          of the circumcision ritual was purely for <A NAME="55"></A>aesthetic 
          reasons. In addition, not for pure magical-religious reasons. Furthermore 
          hygienic motives cannot have been the vital ones, as circumcision takes 
          place many years after the repeated practice of intercourse among both 
          sexes. <FONT SIZE="3">&quot;It seems far more to me that the main reason 
          for circumcision is not difficult to derive from the nature of sexuality.</FONT>
        <P><FONT SIZE="3">Men strive to make the often complicated sexual act 
          as comfortable as possible; and it is beyond discussion, that in this 
          the foreskin often places a decided restriction in the way, which is 
          sometimes even painful, for after penetration the glans can be strangulated</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">, 
          which complicates the act, or, when the prepuce does not lay the glans 
          bare, which accelerates the <I>ejaculatio seminis</I><I>. </I>What could 
          be more obvious than to remove this obstacle, especially since by doing 
          this one gained a decoration signifying the attainment of maturity.</FONT></P>
        <P>Of secondary importance was that subsequently, there were several months 
          of prolongued convalescence, during which the youth now marked as a 
          man, in the absence of schoolingnow at lasthas the opportunity 
          to be initiated in all the mysteries of life by his Master.</P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

          male circumcision. Most of the literature shows no awareness 
          of phimosis - its frequency - or the sexual and erectile problems which can be cured by circumcision. If routine circumcision 
          had been introduced for this most obvious reason of eliminating difficult 
          foreskins; then the importance of an alternative modern method, suitable to our culture's attitudes in this day and age, would be clear. </FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

     <P>On the reason for circumcision I said (Bryk, p. 55): "It seems to me, 
       rather, that the fundamental reason for circumcision can easily be inferred 
       from the nature of sexuality. 
       <P>"Man strives to make the often troublesome act of intercourse as comfortable 
         as possible; and it cannot be denied that the foreskin is often a painful 
         hindrance, becoming strangulated after the entrance of the glans and 
         making the act difficult, or, in case the prepuce does not leave the 
         glans free, hastening the <I>ejaculatio seminis.</I> What could be simpler 
         than to do away with this hindrance, especially since an additional 
         mark of beauty was thus attained for maturity.

              marked as a man, could find opportunity in the absence of schools, to 
              be initiated by his master into all the mysteries of life. 
          <P>The question which was now facing Bryk (<I>referring to himself</I>) 
                was clearly formulated <T>by Merker (1), concerning</T> the function 
                of the foreskin during copulation, in other words, what effect circumcision 
                has on the retardation of ejaculation.
          <P><FONT SIZE="2">1) This explanation was overlooked by all authors probably 
                  because the first edition of his work, which is the one always quoted, 
                  does not contain it, the second not being examined for this purpose. 
                  By chance I came across the second edition and was amazed at the congruence 
                  of our ideas.</FONT> 
          <P>Merker writes (p. 331) &quot;According to what we have seen, the circumcision 
                    of boys seems to have its origin in the view that it increases the procreative 
                    ability of the man. ... This view is based on the experience that a 
                    man with his penis circumcised cohabits longer and excites the woman 
                    more. A man with his penis uncircumcised ejaculates his semen sooner 
                    during coitus, sometimes too soon, before the woman has reached the 
                    climax of sexual pleasure. When the penis is circumcised, the seminal 
                    ejaculation is retarded and coincides with the climax of sexual pleasure, 
                    which is most favorable toward effecting conception. 
          <P>"This leads us to the assumption that the law-giver who introduced 
                      circumcision did it with the purpose of favoring conception and thus 
                      increasing the number of births, i.e. the birth rate. Circumcision became 
                      a preparation for marriage and accordingly is still performed among 
                      the Massai-, as among other primitive peoples, not until the inception 
                      of puberty. Later it became for both Israelites and Massai a tribal 
                      sign and as such was shifted among the former to earliest youth". 
          <P>Merker doubts the advantage of cleanliness (II, p. 332): "for among 
                        the sparsely clad primitive peoples the part in question is much more 
                        exposed to the effects of dust, etc., and to injury by thorns, prickly 
        leaves, flowers and grasses, than it would be otherwise".         </TD></TR></TABLE>

          <P>Friederici and Fehlinger also support the same view, which is summed 
              up by van de Velde (p. 186): "The black youths who meet on the plantations 
              discuss these things among themselves and know that those among them 
              who are circumcised have a much less sensitive glans than those who 
              have not been so treated. The circumcised admit quite candidly that 
              it takes them longer to reach an ejaculation than it does the uncircumcised. 
              (Friederici) 
          <P>"The purpose of circumcision is probably that of lengthening the sexual 
                act, since the uncovered glans is less sensitive than the covered one. 
                (Fehlinger) 
          <P>"Thus it need not surprise us that we repeatedly find women in the 
                  literature of late who endeavor to level out the difference between 
                  'wish' and 'can' by turning to a man who is circumcised after unsatisfactory 
                  relations with other men. 
          <P>"It is difficult to determine whether a man with lessened sensitivity 
                    of the glans loses some of the pleasure of the sexual act, or whether 
                    the prolongation of the act thus caused actually gives him an advantage. 
          <P>"It is certain that in general primitive peoples and especially the 
                      Orientals consider the loss of the prepuce in this respect and for this 
                      reason a decided advantage for they lay great stress upon the greatest 
                      possible prolongation of coitus. Certainly one of the factors here may 
                      be the universal human propensity for enjoying every pleasure to its 
                      full extent, and especially may the desire have made itself manifest 
                      to enlarge as much as possible a series of such intensely pleasurable 
                      emotions (by experience seeming always too short). I consider this - 
                      speaking sexual-psychologically - an absolutely normal desire consciously 
                      or unconsciously manifested in a sexually healthy human being, at least 
                      in men. A more significant factor, however, is the emotional status 
        of natural man who (though he may in other ways neglect women, treat-         </TD></TR></TABLE>

              more emphasis upon the sexual pleasure of the woman than the average 
              man. He - primitive man - is not satisfied with the course of coitus 
              or with himself, if he has not satisfied the woman.(1) He is pleased 
              - this Don Juan contemporain - not only with the gratification he has 
              experienced, but also with that he has imparted. 
          <P> <FONT SIZE="2">1) Unfortunately, illustrative evidence is not given. 
                (B.) </FONT> 
          <P>"Thus the pride of being a desired partner in sexual intercourse has 
                  not been the least important of the reasons inducing man to value the 
                  removal of the prepuce". (Van de Velde) 
          <P>Doiteau also recommends circumcision to individuals with "<I>coita 
                    bref</I>". (Doiteau, p. 22.) 
          <P>No investigations have as yet been made on the physiological effect 
                      of circumcision on erection, the retardation of ejaculation and other 
                      attendant phenomena during the sexual act, and this is also very difficult 
                      and complicated for it could be done only by men who had already had 
                      repeated sexual intercourse before having been circumcised .(2) It is 
                      necessary for these men to have followed exactly the function of their 
                      foreskins in order to be able to tell the difference afterward; but, 
                      from my investigations, most men have not the slightest idea about it, 
                      because all control of reason is lost in <I>congressibus</I>. Where 
                      love begins, reason ends. 
          <P><FONT SIZE="2">2) A well known Finnish physician, who had had himself 
                        circumcised when already mature, told me that after circumcision the 
                        ejaculatio seminis was at first hastened, because the sensitive, previously 
                        hidden portions of the glans were now exposed. (B.) </FONT>
          <P><FONT SIZE="2"><I>* The circumcised man`s ability to make love longer 
                          and please the woman more; must be judged irrelevant to the origins, 
                          simply because such complicated observations and thoughts about cause 
                          and effect, would have been by all accounts not feasable for Bryk`s 
                          prelogical thinker. (RS.)</I> </FONT>
          <P>As a result of this our literature is almost devoid of references to 
                            the role of the foreskin during the sexual act. I was able to find only 
                            allusions in Adler which I shall bring forward when discussing the circumcision 
                            of women and the role of the clitoris in connection with it. 
          <P>I received some valuable information on this topic from Dr. Srecko 
                              Milic, principal in Essegg: two elderly gentlemen had themselves circumcised

              of the ejaculation during sexual intercourse. Neither had been influenced 
              by the other, each impelled by the same desire, had conceived the idea 
              of subjecting himself to this surgical treatment. 1 was assured by my 
              guarantor that the purpose of the operation had been attained. 
          <P>Ethnography gives us a few hints on the duration of the sexual act 
                among primitives, in many cases in regard to circumcised subjects. Thus 
                Moszkowski, in a lecture held before the Medical Society for Sexology 
                and Constitutional Research (February, 1929) on "The Sexual Life in 
                Australia", mentions a case he has observed of an act of copulation 
                lasting half an hour. In answer to my question as to whether the man 
                was circumcised, Moszkowski answered in the affirmative. 
          <P>Frobenius (I, p. 329) tells us that the Bessari hasten "to attain the 
                  ejaculation as soon as possible"; the man squats, the woman is in a 
                  supine position. This tribe ridicules people that are circumcised, both 
        men and women. Here then we have information to the effect         </TD></TR></TABLE>

              contrasting sharply with the cases given by Moszkowski and Eylmann, 
              which are based on circumcised subjects. Eylmann (p. 123) writes: "Moreover, 
              according to information furnished me by bush-people, the act of population 
              is said to last quite a long time. In order not to be misunderstood, 
              let me add that it is my conviction that among primitive peoples generally 
              both sexes are not so quickly aroused sensually as people who belong 
              to an advanced, rather weak-nerved culture, as for example, we Germans". 
          <P>Information on the duration of sexual intercourse must naturally be 
                tested as to its validity. In this field especially the negro likes 
                to boast (Bryk, I, p. 223). In considering duration one must take into 
                account also the position of the cohabitants, since it is well known 
                that the acceleration or retardation of emission depends, in the case 
                of one and the same person, upon the various "positions" (Adler). Consequently 
                the question of positions,(1) so real and conspicuous in the modern 
                popular literature of erotic enlightenment, must be borne in mind in 
                all future research and considerations on the effect of circumcision. 
                Among the Ethiopian tribes, according to Frobenius (1, p. 276), the 
                squatting position is typical, it is the "only decent" one. The normal 
            "covering" position is considered obnoxious by the Chambo; it also offers 
            "but slight prospect for speedy offspring".

          <P>As a result of man's erect position, as also in the case of bats, the 
                non-erect penis, formerly hidden in the folded pocket of the foreskin, 
                became more prominent (Meisenheimer, p. 255). Consequently its normal 
                position is dependent, <I>penis pendulus,</I> except in the case of 
                the bushmen, among whom it is said to have retained its position as 
            <I>penis rectus. </I>(1)<I> </I> The foreskin pocket was gradually transformed 
                by being shifted forward but unfolded at the same time, so that now, 
                with its skin duplicity, it formed a homogeneous elongation of the skin 
                covering of the penis. It usually extends beyond the tip of the penis 
                in a probiscidiform continuation, but during erection is capable of 
                withdrawing more or less or is turned back by the protuberation of the 
                stiffened organ. 
          <P>The prepuce is considered by many to be an organ of protection, having 
                  the function of safeguarding "the tender skin of the glans from harmful 
                  external effects" (Kutna, p. 100-102) and preserving the sensitiveness 
                  of the sexual part (Doiteau, p. 20). It is also to "keep itself slippery 
                  so long as the glans is not functioning". Since "the protection originally 
                  afforded by the foreskin has been given by clothing for thousands of 
                  years, the foreskin has, in the course of time, suffered the loss of

              (1) 
          <P>Through domestication, which has in other respects had a negative effect 
                upon sexuality, man, among other advantageous characteristics, has suffered 
                the loss of the retractability of the foreskin to a great degree (2) 
                I call attention to the fact that our major domestic animals, the cow, 
                horse and dog have come to rely upon the obstetric assistance of human 
                beings in "dropping"; and that in covering, man must often also help, 
                by placing the erect organ of the bull into the vagina of the cow in 
                order thus to facilitate the procedure. It is open to doubt just what 
                factors brought about this degeneration of retractibility in the human 
                being, whether it is at all a consequence or attendant phenomenon of 
                the process of transformation of the mammalian penis into the penis 
                pendulus, whether it was favored by the fact that the anterior extremities 
                developed into manipulatory organs, hands,(3) which could be of assistance 
                at the decisive moment, or whether, with the abandonment of periods 
                of heat, a steady preparedness (semper pronto, as Casanova says) set 
                in. All three factors could have been of influence. 
          <P>In short, all over the world, in peoples that do not circumcise themselves 
                  in youth, the retraction of the penis is executed manually, the glans 
                  is exposed, or as Verlaine so finely puts it, is "decapped", (d&eacute;calott&eacute;). 
                  Among us it is done secretly, in Japan this is almost a public affair; 
                  having the penis constantly in a retracted state is part of the national 
                  character of the Japanese. In Japan it

                    about naked in the thorny underbrush, to circumcise and thus deprive 
                    Himself of this natural organ of protection. (B.)<BR>

              erection also. Our guarantor, the Japanese physician Adachi, gives us

          lead to denudation of the glans.         </TD></TR></TABLE>

          <P>"Every Japanese entering maturity asks himself in the beginning why 
              his glans is not completely free like that of other adults, and in this 
              way arrives at an unfortunate suspicion of the naturalness of his own 
              member". He therefore shoves the foreskin back. "This operation is practiced 
              by every one, but it is kept secret". It is no custom "but an almost 
              universal and quite secret usage", which is "dictated by that shame 
              of <I>kawakamuri</I>". 
          <P>Adachi considers phimosis the origin of this practice*. Here again 
                the effect is confused with the motive. Indeed, Adachi himself gives 
                a mimetic one as inductive (the model of the denuded penis of the adults).

                  the subject except when discussing the baring of the glans: &quot;The

                  one of the circumcision rites.&quot;(RS)</FONT> 
          <P> The perpetually free glans of the Japanese is called by Adachi "an 
                    artificial phenomenon". The denudation is attained in the following 
                    manner: the foreskin is shoved back behind the <I>corona glandis</I> 
            and often retained in that position by means of a string, so that finally, 
            in many cases, it "cannot be extended forward any more to cover the 
                    glans". The conduct of Japanese is interesting when the penis is to 
                    be exposed. At the bath or medical examinations (e.g. for military service) 
                    a Japanese would never present himself otherwise than decapped. If, 
                    as sometimes happens, the prepuce slips forward again, he quickly draws 
                    it back in order not to offend against good form. With us the contrary 
                    is the case. A European, in a similar position, would quickly draw his 
                    retracted foreskin forward. Likewise the Eskimo, who goes about naked 
                    in his igloo, but who never forgets to tie up his foreskin with a fish 
                    sinew to prevent the glans from becoming visible. Art furnishes us with 
                    similar parallels. While Japanese art never represents the penis otherwise 
                    than denuded, occidental art in naked statues or pictures always shows 
                    it covered by the probiscidiform continuation of the foreskin, except 
                    in phallic representations: one need but recall Greek plastic art with 
        its Adonis, Phoebus, Dionysus, etc. To us the penis looks         </TD></TR></TABLE>

              to perform postectomy in such a way that the circumcised penis looks 
              as if it were uncircumcised. This is exactly the case in Africa as well: 
              those tribes that are circumcised always represent the penis in this 
              way on their wooden statues; the neighboring tribes, however, that are 
              unacquainted with circumcision, constantly represent it as <I>membrum

              of masturbation or repeated sexual intercourse, the tip of the glans 
              often becomes visible, the shrunken and retracted foreskin leaving a 
              greater or lesser portion of the glans free, remaining in this position 
              permanently. This preputial crown, netted with folds and swollen veins 
              together with the tip of the penis, does actually remind one of the 
              acorn cup with the acorn peeping out. However, among the Japanese, where 
              the glans is worn free and consequently looks different, it is called 
            "<I>kito</I>&quot;, turtle-head, because, as has been shown by the relationship

          <P>covered it, conceiving both parts of the organ as going together according 
              to the figure. I have called attention to the fact also that the ancient 
              Israelites originally had no independent concept of the foreskin, because 
              they considered it to be a part of the skin covering of the penis. But 
              according to Blanchard, the Latin <I>praeputium</I> already contains 
              a reference to circumcision, since the word putium is said to be derived 
              from <I>puto</I> (<I>a putando dictur</I>). And according to Stieda 
              (p. 240) even the Italian<I> putto, puzzo</I> (<I>puzzoso</I>), which 
              is known in German as <I>Putte</I>, is to be derived from <I>putium; 
                </I>putte would then be equivalent to <I>Schwanzlein</I> (little tail). 
          <P>Those primitive peoples that are acquainted with circumcision differentiate 
                quite definitely between the foreskin and the denudation of the glans, 
                or the state of circumcision. Among the Nandi there are different designations 
                for the circumcised and uncircumcised penis (<I>pirtit</I>). The Pitta-Pitta 
                call the uncircumcised boy "<I>Nulla-maro</I>," i.e., possessor of a 
                foreskin, in contradistinction to the circumcised, who is called "<I>Kati</I>" 
            (head) and his circumcised member "mondo&quot;. In Europe the glans 
                is also often called "head" (e.g. the Finns)(1) as in Japan (Adachi, 
                p. 1, note 2). In the former place, however, head is to be taken to 
                mean the pileus of the mushroom. 
          <P><FONT SIZE="2">1) But "head" has also the signification of tip or end. 
                  The Finnish scientific term is terska. </FONT>
          <P>"The edible boletus, on account of its form, is often the subject, 
                    among Europeans as well as Japanese, of common jokes, in which, be it

          <P>national derivations in connection with the covering or uncovering 
              of the head. In this conception, naturally, the most obvious function 
              of the head, that of eating, is kept in mind, and this explains why 
              primitive man often identifies cohabitation with eating, as is shown 
              by the Nandi phrase (Bryk, p. 225). The emotions of the head are also 
              transferred to its likeness: thus a Nandi woman when seeing an inflamed 
              penis says, "He is angry". The word "phimosis" as well, is derived from 
              similar primitive associations, from phimos, a muzzle, being the foreskin 
              which pathologically cannot be retraced, muzzling the mouth. 
          <P>Even more remarkable and more valuable for our study are the deductions 
                of von Sydow who sees in the extravagant exaggeration of the size of 
                the head in the plastic art of primitive peoples a subconscious dependence 
                of the primitive's imagination on the phallic representation, which 
                dominates him completely.
          <P> "But this striking peculiarity is also founded erogenetically on the 
                  picture of the erect phallus. For it is then noticed that the glans 
                  is enlarged out of all proportion to the organ as such. The relationship 
                  of size between the glans and the member corresponds exactly to that 
                  enormity of the head in primitive figures! lt now becomes clear why, 
                  in mask costumes, such extraordinary emphasis is placed on the mask 
                  itself, because it is the symbol of that part of the body most sensitive 
                  to pleasure." (von Sydow, p. 102.) 
          <P> It is certainly of major importance whether the canon advanced by 
                    Sydow, supposedly binding for the plastic art of all primitive peoples, 
                    is valid or not. Moreover, the phallic interpretations of this well 
                    known art theorist are of fundamental significance in the matter at

          <P>tion, is closely bound up with the representation of the glans. Not 
              less interesting are the word formations that are based on no visible 
              models (serpent-head, acorn, head, mouth), but that have arisen out 
              of abstract reflections. Thus, the strictly scientific name of the penis 
              in its normally pendent condition is "<I>membrum mortuum</I>", dead 
              member, while when stiff and erect it is called alive, "<I>membrum vivum</I>" 
            (Eberth). In truth, a very remarkable terminology that designates the 
            lasting condition as something dead and the unusual condition (to be 
            sure, one that is swelled with life) as normal, living - a point of 
            view which we also find among negroes. The Nandi woman, beholding the 
            relaxed penis after coitus, says, <I>nakwisha kufa</I>, "he has died"! 
              For her it is dead. Throughout the entire line of reasoning we find 
              the phallic, exhibitionistic concept, which imputes to the life-giving 
              phallus a power that conquers death and which was thought or wished 
              to be everlasting. 
          <P>Similar modes of thinking play a decisive role in the emotional life 
                of the child, fill his imagination and dominate his whole ego. In nature 
                he observed the stiffened member of the domestic animals, or in the 
                bush that of the wild mammals; also the half exposed, glandiform penis 
                of his father or other adults (Cf. Noah and Ham). He refers these engrams 
                thus received directly to himself and notices that he is different, 
                that a piece of "meat" covers what should be exposed. He will have it 
                out and plucks at his member. Local irritations (<I>e.g.</I> phimosis) 
                also seem to play a part in the release of onanism (Kronfeld, p. 532). 
                It allows him no rest, it torments, it harasses the child, who longs 
                for the moment when he will finally have succeeded in drawing the foreskin 
                back behind the groove of the glans (<I>sulcus retroglandularis</I>). 
                In this manner he removes an infantile phimosis and performs a "post-natal 
                act", which Trusen really considers circumcision to be, quite instinctively,

          <P>say, automatically. Masturbation is only an attendant phenomenon, it 
              is not that which gives the deciding impulse to these manipulations 
              but rather the picture of the phallus; "whether buck and bull or man 
              was the prototype of the phallus that became the symbol of the cult, 
              is quite immaterial. Before man actually realized the signification 
              of the sexual parts of the buck, he had most certainly become duly attentive 
              to his own. Man always drew conclusions from himself and applied them 
              to other beings, real or imagined ... Before men saw the bull in the 
              zodiac, they must have been acquainted with the common, Indian bull, 
              whose powerful member undoubtedly attracted their attention. The purpose 
              of the member was known to them from experience and they therefore considered 
              the possessor of the strongest member to be especially fitted to illustrate 
              the power of procreation. When they made an image of a prominent person 
              or an anthropomorphic god, they did not forget to supply him at times 
              with an immense sexual tool as a visible sign of his superiority". (Kraus 
              in Dulaure, p. 6.) 
          <P> These or similar thoughts may have animated a mature, adult man, when 
                he made himself his phallus-god; they do not apply to the child. Only 
                the optical impression of the denuded penis, which he had a chance to 
                see more often in animals than in men, and which is there more striking 
                on account of its considerably greater size, had an effect upon his 
                imagination and first impelled him to denudation, which otherwise, according 
                to Stieda (p. 261) is manifest only in adults and "without special manual 
                assistance only during erection when the member has become stiff."

          <P>custom of denudation. "Among many Turkish families the foreskin is 
              retracted after birth and the process frequently repeated in order prophylactically 
              to remove adhesions". (Risa) Perhaps it is for a similar reason that 
              many fathers masturbate their children, on which Tessmann reports (III, 
              p. 509): "Onanism is rare but there is prevalent among the Simaku the 
              remarkable custom of fathers massaging the penis of their little boys. 
              They sit on the four footed bed and take the member of the boy between 
              their big and second toes, or if they sit lower they sometimes knead 
              it with their hands also, which the boys do not at all object to. I 
              observed this custom several times. That is probably the reason why 
              the little fellows, though only four to six years old, had erections 
              every moment, which were not very noticeable, but often slyly hidden."' 
          <P> Risa first argued in favor of purposed denudation, but it must have 
                arisen originally out of quite other and much more primitive motives. 
                Preuss (p. 281) reports: "a child that is fat, 'surrounded by flesh', 
                must, according to Max Samuel, look circumcised at least at the time 
                of erection (of the child's penis)", and thus is not required to be 
                circumcised, according to the Jewish rite. Here then, it is clear that 
                denudation is considered a substitute for circumcision. In principle 
                circumcision is displaced by denudation. As a matter of fact, however, 
                boys who are not circumcised until they reach puberty also denude their 
                glans manually, and it is noteworthy that parents and older people prohibit 
                touching the member with the hands. (Bryk, I, p. 220.) Even among the 
                Jews there are exaggerated orders that forbid touching one's member. 
                Thus we read in the Talmud, according to Buxdorf (p. 112): Whoever touches 
                his hand to his (sexual) member, let his hand be struck off to its middle.

          <P> <FONT SIZE="2">1) When I asked whether these massages of the penis 
                  among the Simaku were perhaps for the purpose of denuding the glans,

          <P>when urinating (1), one may not take his penis into his hand. Whoever 
              takes his sexual member into his hand and urinates, it is as if he brought 
              the flood into the world. (Cf. also Wunderbar, p. 27.) 
          <P><FONT SIZE="2">1) The ancient Israelites probably urinated in a crouching 
                position, like the negroes, (Bryk, I, p. 101.) Reinig has also observed 
                this manner of urinating among the Islamttic Pamir-Kirghiz and Tajiks. 
                </FONT> 
          <P>The "phallic hand" is also connected with denudation and masturbation. 
                  Dulaure says (p. 215): "The extended middle finger represents the <I>membrum 
                    virile</I> and the bent fingers on each side are the testicles. That 
                  is why the Romans called the middle finger <I>digitus impudicus</I> 
            or <I>infamis</I>, and the Greeks, <I>the lewd finger</I>, which expression 
                  is to a degree similar to the Latin and referred to shameful secret 
                  practices, once less common than now." 
          <P>But the skin of the penis is also denuded by means of chemical influence. 
                    I have observed this peculiar manner of retraction among the Nandi. 
                    I wrote the following about it (Bryk, I, p. 225): 
          <P>"Among the Semi-hamites it (masturbation) occurs more from the desire 
                      to have the foreskin drawn back as early as possible, in order thus 
                      to resemble the older folks more, than to satisfy awakening desires. 
                      It is common practice among the Nandi for the boys to smear sticky, 
                      milky juice of the euphorbiaceous plant <I>yeptiringuet</I> on the glans 
                      and to masturbate <I>(lat pertit) </I>with it. The juice of this plant 
                      is quite caustic and causes the glans to swell up strongly, so that 
                      the foreskin can easily be drawn back; which is what is wanted. During 
                      the process the boys call out, <I>"Suren suren, ce kwamon pek a metet"</I> 
            (Become big and I'll give you something to eat). The blossoms of this 
            plant are usually stuck into the hair, the separated milk serving as 
            the agglutinant. Now the little fellow can go to a girl and try it". 
          <P>Apparently this is a case of artificially produced paraphimosis. This 
                        treatment seems to be very painful, for when a moran (circumcised warrior)

              drew his lips forward and exclaimed an inarticulate "Ooh!" as if he

          <P>I know of only one other reference in anthropological literature to 
                chemical denudation, among the Massai. Merker (p. 345) writes the following 
                on <I>"ol jogi," (Euphorbia </I>spec.): "In order to appear circumcised, 
                the children smear the juice of the Euphorbia on the glans, which then 
                swells up and holds back the prepuce". P. 63 (note) tells us the same 
                thing in Latin: <I>"Ut decisi (circumcisi videantur pueri interdum glandem 
                  succu herbae Euphorbiae genere, nomine 'ol jogi', oblinunt. Glans tumescens 
                  prohibet, ne praeputium prolabatur"</I>. 
          <P>Merker's explanation that this process was for the purpose of "appearing 
                  circumcised" is quite untenable. For when the little boy has finally 
                  succeeded in making the prepuce retractable behind the <I>Sulcus glandis, 
                    </I>he does not repeat this chemical manipulation; nor does his penis 
                  look circumcised, because the prepuce automatically slips forward and 
                  constantly covers the glans. Moreover it would be ridiculous if a little 
                  shaver tried to pass for circumcised, since among the Nandi and Massai 
                  circumcision is performed during the fourteenth year at the earliest, 
                  usually about the seventeenth or eighteenth, and no one would seriously 
                  expect to find a child circumcised. He could be compared to little boys 
                  who paint themselves a moustache with charcoal, but who are never taken 
                  seriously by any one. Then again, a circumcised penis looks quite different 
                  from one that is merely denuded. (Cf. p. 207.) 
          <P>lt is not impossible that the poisonous herbs used in some places to 
                    treat the wound of circumcision (e.g. among the Magwamba (Junod), which 
          "are not medicinal         </TD></TR></TABLE>

              denudation in the manner of the Euphorbia described, and have been received 
              into the ceremony of circumcision as "survivals". According to Buschan 
              (p. 239) similar features may be traced in Indian erotic practices. 
              There "is a whole list of recipes . . . which have the purpose, by means 
              of rubbing in sharp (caustic) vegetable matter, of evoking an inflammation, 
              even blistering, of the skin of the penis, whereby the latter increases 
              in volume". 
            <P>Jacobus X . . . mentions a kind of transition from manual to chemical 
                denudation of the glans. Among the inhabitants of Tahiti the boys make 
                use of the urine caught in the pocket of the foreskin to loosen up and 
                extend their prepuce, which usually clings close to the glans. Since 
                Jacobus X ... gives very interesting information on the masculine genitalia 
                of the Tahitians, I quote the passage in question. The genitalia of 
                the Tahitian, says Jacobus X. . . are very similar to those of the inhabitant 
                of Central Europe. 
            <P>"The usually cylindrical penis of fine, dark red color with a slight 
                  mixture of ochre and sepla, is on the average 18 (16-20) centimeters 
                  long and 4-5 centimeters in diameter, seldom more, and rarely reaching 
                  22 centimeters In erection the penis hardens and stands almost vertical 
                  in the twenty year old <I>tane</I> (youth), so that it touches the abdomen, 
                  which, according to my guarantor, is almost impossible in a penis that 
                  remains half soft. The glans is relatively large. The testicle is said 
                  to be larger than those of any other race and to reach the size of a 
                  hen's egg. At fifteen to sixteen years, sometimes even at twelve, it 
                  has already attained a development equal to that of the twenty year 
                  old European and is the size of a dove's egg. Although there is very

          <P>prepares for the adventures of love in his eleventh or twelfth year, 
              sometimes even his tenth. In order to get his glans free, he takes the 
              foreskin between his thumb and index finger when he urinates, so that 
              only a small opening remains for the passage of the urine; the urine, 
              in collecting, forms a jacket around the glans under the foreskin, and 
              since the lad repeats this several times a day, there is a regular mechanical 
              distension of the opening. If that is not sufficient to free the glans, 
              the lad cuts through the ligament with a large piece of flint and heals 
              the wound without danger or pain by applying to the wound some cotton 
              saturated with the juice of an arnica like plant. Immediately thereafter 
              his intercourse with the feminine sex begins. Coitus is performed from 
              the front, rarely from behind. Between his twentieth and fortieth year 
              (according to the same guarantor) the tane has an exceptionally strong 
              impulse to discharge". 
          <P>According to the general opinion of physicians, the foreskin of the 
                youth does not retract with denudation, for which reason this condition 
                is looked upon as a sign of his "virginity". Wolfsheimer (p. 21) writes: 
            "There is no positive doubt among physicians that in Christians of the 
                age of 13 the prepuce is so tight that the glans of the penis cannot 
                be denuded without the greatest pain, for which reason physicians are 
                wont to consider this tightness of the prepuce as one of the signs of 
                virginity. Although as far as stiffness and erection of the penis of 
                such youth is concerned, it is sometimes found to be capable of and 
                suitable for copulation; nevertheless, we think it unfitted for generation 
            itself on account of the narrowness of the prepuce".</P>
          <P><FONT SIZE="3">Thus the foreskin "muzzles" the youth and is a serious 
            hindrance to completing the sexual act. We have shown that this becomes

              experiences disapointment as a result of this, he had imagined that 
              the foreskin would go further backwards, as shown by the examples of 
              the erection of the dog, horse or bull,but now he notices that 
              the frenulum, the ligament joining the blade of the foreskin with the 
              glans and penis,prevents any further backwards movement. He 
              conceives the idea of cutting through the frenulum. (1) Perhaps he had 
              already heard from his older comrades in suffering, that due to its 
              shortness it sometimes rips during coitus.
          <P>"The Kayapo wear a cap, which they fasten on to the prepuce, after 
                they have cut through the frenulum with a taqua splinter". (Kissenberth 
                after Koch, p. 110.) 
          <P>Cases of severing of the frenulum are known to me in the literature 
                  only among the inhabitants of the Loyalty Islands (Sarasin) and, as 
                  just mentioned, among the Tahitians. That among the latter the severing 
                  of the frenulum is directly dependent upon the denudation of the glans 
                  explains the reason for that remarkable mutilation. It is only now that 
                  the youth undertakes sexual intercourse. 
          <P><FONT SIZE="2">1) In the case of a short frenulum, by which the glans 
                    of the penis is drawn crooked during erection, ejaculation is made more

          <P>Kobelt (p. 18) maintains that, as in the case of the glans plate of 
                      the stallion, the human glans increases in diameter in the vagina, though 
                      to a lesser degree.

          <P>Kobelt writes (p. 60): "In pressing further in, the sharply projecting 
                crown on the glans slides over the wall of both bulbi by a sudden jerk 
                and this ring-shaped cushion embraces the neck and body of the penis 
                like the hame does the neck of a horse; behind this the skin of the 
                glans comes into intimate contact with the elastic and tender padding 
                of the vaginal tube". 
          <P>It is remarkable that Kobelt does not mention at all the part played 
                  by the foreskin during copulation; to him, apparently, it does not exist 
                  as an accessory organ during the rhythmical friction. Nor could I find 
                  any information on this in the literature, in spite of my pains. Only 
                  in Adler did I find an allusion to the subject, which I quote. It confirms 
                  my observation. "If, accordingly, it is an indisputable fact that the 
                  clitoris, and especially its glans, is not by any means an absolutely 
                  necessary organ for the attainment of the highest sexual pleasure, its 
                  anatornical favor, being supplied with special and plentiful nerves, 
                  seems to require explanation. It appears to me to be much more plausible 
                  that these collection points of the finest nerve endings, directed externally, 
                  and to be found in both sexes, indicate that by friction in general 
                  of the sexual parts a peculiar condition may be evoked, when once the 
                  rnysterious forebodings of the sexual instinct have furtively made themselves 
                  known. Both, the <I>glans penis</I> and the <I>glans clitoridis</I>, 
                  have their movable skin coverings, their prepuce. But I do not consider 
                  this to be a protection, intended carefully to guard and preserve the 
                  sensitivity of the fine nerve endings, as has many times been said where, 
                  then, are the Jews, the Turks and all the Mohammedans, who, in spite 
                  of circumcision, are noted for their sensuality! - but quite on the 
                  contrary, an accidental stimulant. Amid all the movements of the body, 
                  these skin folds must also be moved, and if the sexual parts are in 
        an excitable condition (similar to         </TD></TR></TABLE>

          <P>erection), nature in this way points out the direction and course the 
              impulse is to take. I make bold to go even further and believe that 
              the typical secretion of the glans, which, as <I>smegma praeputiale</I>, 
              forms so abundantly in these very heavy folds, is a link in the chain 
              of natural stimulants which instinctively lead the individual to the 
              satisfaction of the sexual desire". 
          <P>I have myself already mentioned this among the suggested explanations 
                in connection with the physiological motive (p. 75). The cohabitant 
                sometimes experiences pain due to the narrowness of the vagina because 
                his foreskin, which also contributes to enlarging the volume of the 
                root, becomes strangulated. It may even happen, according to Waldeyer 
                (p. 653) that "minor injuries occur to the foreskin, glans, and <FONT SIZE="3">especially</FONT> 
            the frenulum particularly when this is too short&quot; . But it is much 
                more common that, when the vagina is not too narrow, the foreskin, bent 
                back and made to "disappear" along the smooth surface of the penis, 
                or kept behind the groove of the glans in some other way, begins to 
                pass up and back over the sulcus due to the rhythm of the friction, 
                making the contact with the surface of the glans more intimate and thus 
                contributing directly to accelerate the ejaculation, since it is around 
        the neck of the glans         </TD></TR></TABLE>

          <P>that the most sensitive centers of feeling (1) are found. This acceleration, 
              naturally, is undesirable to both partners. At first, in the heat of 
              youthful ardor and with his egocentric sexual nature, the young man 
              does not bother much about it, but with the passing of the years when 
              the symptoms of pre-impotence appear, then the emotional depression 
              reappearing with the foreskin complex becomes acute and what is more 
              natural than to think of a remedy? Obviously, by means of magic: one 
              gladly sacrifices to the gods what is troublesome to him, what he wants 
              to be rid of. 
          <P><FONT SIZE="2">1) According to Buschke the papillae sometimes seen 
                here signify that the glans "once possessed a horny covering, which 
                gradually was lost." </FONT>
          <P>It is also possible that the frequent occurrence of children "born 
                  circumcised" may have given the neurotic the idea of the superfluity 
                  of the prepuce, as Niebuhr supposes (p. 79). The absence of the foreskin 
                  in children born circumcised may have convinced autochthons "that the 
                  foreskin was of no use. And since it was sometimes found to be a hindrance 
                  in coitus, this may have caused circumcision". It may also be assumed 
                  that the first surgical removal of a phimosis gave occasion directly 
                  for <I>incisio</I> or <I>circumcisio</I>, but at any rate the emotions 
                  of the considerably erotically tormented victim must have been quite 
                  ripe for this self punishment, prior to any secondary, external impulses 
                  which may have driven him to perform the act. Even without this, without 
                  a model, the now senescent man, ever since his youth under the spell 
                  of the foreskin complex, would and must logically have arrived at the 
                  idea of removing the source of his torment. And by the removal of the 
                  prepuce, the erogenetic zone must have shifted more toward the root 
                  of the penis. 
          <P>It is no matter of chance that according to Israelitic myth, the first 
                    man to have himself circumcised was not a child, nor a boy nor even

          <P>potence were making themselves felt but who still wanted to have a 
              child. Dr. Arnold Schultze, the well know explorer, gave me a statement 
              of the negroes of Central Africa, according to which the Bagandi, who 
              circumcised themselves between their twentieth and twenty-fifth year, 
              perform the operation only "when they can not do it properly". It is 
              also known that in men who are uncircumcised a too great sensitivity 
              of the glans may lead to a kind of impotence. 
          <P>Bloch says on this (p. 498): "Very peculiar and in a way analogous 
                to vaginism in women is impotence through too great sensitivity to pain 
                of the glans or local inflammations. The pains experienced during coitus 
                by one in this condition are often so severe, that all pleasure in sexual 
                intercourse is lost".(1) 
          <P><FONT SIZE="2">1) The glans, after it has been denuded for the first 
                  time is so sensitive that boys give up masturbating for a time as a 
                  result of the pain. </FONT> 
          <P>The failure of masculine potency during coitus, which is often only 
                    transitory, naturally caused primitive peoples to think about it. One 
                    need only call to mind the many aphrodisiacs known to popular therapeutics. 
                    Among Indian erotic practices one meets repeatedly with allusions to 
                    many measures taken against the unwelcome symptoms of impotence. Very 
                    remarkable (2 ) are precautions of the Chinese, the blood treatment 
                    of the penis which they administer themselves: "The Chinese, for whom 
                    sexual activity forms such an important part of existence, is naturally 
                    quite keen on preserving and increasing his potency. There are countless 
                    more or less nonsensical devices and medicaments that serve this purpose. 
                    Of the latter the most common are pulverized deer-horn and tiger-bone, 
                    or even tiger flesh and the famous Ginseng 
          <P><FONT SIZE="2">2) There is in European folklore an instrument against 
                      impotence, which, though recommended only in derision, is of a certain 
                      psychogenic interest. If one is no more able, says the Pole, then let 
                      him procure a "Kolbuszuwa spoen" (Kolbuszowska lyzka). Kolbuszowa in 
                      Galicia was famous for its excellent turners and wood carvers. The spoon 
                      in question consists of two scoops with a handle in the middle. The 
                      two scoops are placed under the scrotum and the handle under the flaccid 
                      penis. It was probably a similar idea that gave rise to the new invention 
        of a penis support "Amor Star." </FONT>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

          <P>root. One method seems especially worthy of mention and appears eminently 
              successful, namely, a local blood treatment performed by the patient 
              himself, not by injection, which would have little to recommend it here, 
              but by the old Chinese method of pinching. Along the body of the penis 
              one or two Mark-sized, dark-blue wales are pinched and after twelve 
              to twenty four hours a noticeable intensification of the power of sexual 
              reaction appears, apparently caused by the stimulating effect of the 
              extravascular blood and the increased blood stream necessary for its 
              resorption. Perhaps this extremely simple method may afford many an 
              old man back home a little pleasure". (Hartmann.) 
          <P>Primitive man soon found out that by means of all kinds of manipulation 
                and intervention in a positive sense the perfection of the mechanics 
                of copulation and even its refinement could be effected. The Chinese 
                blood treatment is only a stage in this direction. The Sumatra Islander 
                goes farther: he does not pinch the skin of his penis but implants in 
                it a number of small stones or silver and gold platelets. 
          <P><A NAME="implant"></A>According to Hagen the process of implantation 
                  is performed by native itinerant medicine sellers in the following manner: 
            "The skin of the masculine organ (not including the foreskin) is stretched 
                  with the fingers in such a way that it is drawn strongly to either side 
                  and back toward the root of the penis. Then with a sharp knife a cut 
                  about two centimeters long is made down to the fascia, and into this 
                  cut, in the hypodermic cellular tissue, is set a small white stone, 
                  usually of one centimeter, but sometimes double this size, prismatic 
                  in form and with rounded edges. Then the skin is let go, which, due 
                  to its elasticity, returns to its former position and covers the stone. 
                  The latter, finally, is situated one or two centimeters away from the 
                  cut, whereby suppuration is prevented. But it seems that the latter 
        is not always         </TD></TR></TABLE>

          <P>successful, in view of the decidedly high degree of local irritation: 
              the man whose disfigured penis I saw had had these stones set in about 
              twenty five years ago, in order, as he said, to please the women, who 
              were "crazy" about such a man. There had originally been ten such stones, 
              but only four were now left; the others, as he put it, had been lost 
              in the course of time, that is, had been cast out by the tissue. The 
              same man also told me: rich and aristocratic Rajahs of the Tobah lands 
              had silver and gold platelets set in instead of these white stones. 
              But this custom is rare". 
          <P>From the legends of the Africans it may be concluded that the negroes 
                also retain a subconscious recollection of a kind of implantation. In 
                a fable, the spider-man has "the smith make him another iron thorn for 
                his member". (Frobenius, Das schwarze Dekameron, p. 273, 1910.) Artificial 
                instruments of stimulation may also be applied to other parts. The glans 
                is perforated and into the hole is placed a foreign body that embraces 
                the friction surfaces of both bulbi more tightly. Thus arose "Ampallang" 
            and "Kambiong". In discussing the instruments of stimulation of the 
                masculine organ of animals, Meisenheimer (p. 342) remarks: "I have proof 
                from the sexual psychology of man that these formations actually do 
                exert a sexual stimulus. In man, as well as in most of the lower mammals, 
                the stiff, firm organ of procreation, with its swollen glans, is in 
                itself an organ of stimulation. But that is not always sufficient. I 
                shall not speak here of the many devices which are the products of super-refined 
                decadent civilization, but simply of the almost universal practices 
                of primitive man. It is customary among the Dajaks of Borneo and the 
                inhabitants of North Celebes for the men to perforate their glans transversely 
                above the urethra and to place in the artificial canal thus formed,

          <P>In Borneo this apparatus is called Ampallang, in Celebes, Kambiong, 
            and its use is so general, its effect so esteemed, that the Dajak women 
            have an actual right of demanding the application of this instrument 
            by the men. Refusal would be a ground for divorce. That is not enough. 
            In Celebes the stimulative effect of the Kambiong is further supported 
            by the eyelids and eye-lashes of a buck that are tied around the margin 
            of the glans (Fig. 20), which in Java are replaced by strips of goat-skin. 
            The Araucanians of South America seem to make use of similar devices; 
            they apply to the same part little bristles of horse hair, the so-called 
            <I>geskels</I>." 
          <P>Thomas Candisch, already in the year 1588, reported the <I>perforatio

          <P>Zulu Islands. His sailors observed "among the natives a peculiar kind 
              of infibulation; after circumcision a tin nail was driven through the 
              glans of every masculine child: the point of the nail was split and 
              then bent back, the head of the nail forming a little crown. The wound 
              caused by the driving in of the nail during childhood healed without 
              causing the infibulated child much pain. The people drew the nail out 
              and put it back in the glans according to their need and taste. In order 
              to convince themselves of the truth of this as well as out of a reasonable 
              curiosity, the companions of Candisch themselves tested this insertion 
              and removal of the nail on one of the sons of the chieftain (Kaziken), 
              a ten-year old boy. This custom or usage was said to have been introduced 
              at the instigation of the women; for when the latter saw that the men 
              were strongly addicted to sodomy (pederasty), they paid a visit to the 
              chieftains and demanded, for the future, the use of the infibulation 
              described in order to prevent this evil by such great inconvenience". 
              (Karsch, pp. 217-218.) 
          <P>But it is difficult to see why this means should be a hindrance only 
                in homo-erotic practices, and lose its effectiveness in normal sexual 
                acts. Apparently this device is similar to the <I>Kambiong</I>. 
          <P>From these examples it must be clear to every one that man is capable 
                  of mutilating the penis out of purely erogenic grounds. In the case 
                  of the <I>Ampallang</I> and the <I>Kambiong</I> he must submit to the 
                  painful operation of the perforation of the glans. 
          <P>But it is also said that perforation of the glans is performed without 
                    any manifest purpose of intensifying the <I>libido sexualis</I> during 
                    coitus, but to be purely a plastic expression of self-mortification. 
          <P>Motilinia reports about the people of Teoucan, Teotetlan and Cozcatlan

              if any one fainted during this operation it was said of him that he 
              had already sinned and had had intercourse with women. We hear exactly 
              the same thing from Yucatan where sometimes penitents place themselves 
              in a row, each one perforates his penis,(1) and a string, as long as 
              possible, drawn through the members of all the penitents together".

          <P>The drawing of the string through all the members as through the eye 
                  of a needle probably symbolizes the feeling of connection on the part 
                  of the class of men in question; perhaps there is a homo-erotic idea 
                  at the bottom of this "union". 
          <P>We have attempted to describe the psychic phenomena in the sexual life 
                    of man from the awakening of the sexual instinct to the emotional depression 
                    of the neurotic, and have placed circumcision in a direct connection 
                    with, or in dependence to, them. His suggestibility, produced by the 
            "omnipotence of thought," vouched for the efficacy of artificial means 
                    of retardation. 
          <P>But circumcision is not an insurance policy against impotence One day 
                      Abraham, or any other man, notices that in spite of circumcision his 
                      erotic energy gradually begins to fail, then approximately the following 
                      thoughts take hold of him: "A woman can always, at least from the physiological 
                      point of view, receive, but the maliciousness of fate often plays a 
                      man, in erotic equipment, a nasty trick. How fine it is for women. How 
                      would it be if I transformed myself into a woman"? 
          <P>This is, then, a purely bi-sexual thought which arose perhaps as a 
                        result of a homo-erotic bent. He now further mutilates his sexual organ, 
                        seizes a stone knife, slits up the urethra with it from the scrotum

          <P>ber is transformed into a vulva. Now he can be both: man and woman. 
              With the execution of introcision the circumcision idea, from the physiological-erotic 
              standpoint, has reached the termination of its complete development: 
              only in a psychic direction could it now change, be transformed, deepened, 
              by suppressing the original purpose and putting in its place new factors, 
              depending on which cultural unit it met with. In this manner, during 
              the course of a long time, the original sense of circumcision was changed, 
              as it is most obviously shown in the Mosaic Yahweh cult. Quite correctly 
              Gunkel says (p. 17): "We may only ask what historical Israel thought 
              of this custom, but we must keep in mind from the beginning the possibilities 
              that this later sense is quite different from the original one; further, 
              that the conception of this custom has changed during historical times, 
              and finally, that it was executed according to ancient usage, without 
        much thought on the matter at all".         </TD></TR></TABLE>

          <P>Just as every other good discovery immediately becomes incorporated 
                in the state social welfare system, such was the case with circumcision. 
                And according to the culture it found, it received a corresponding stamp 
                and commensurate significance. 
          <P>At first the father circumcised his sons: circumcision was purely a 
                  family affair. But primitive society succeeded in immediately seizing 
                  it for another capacity: initiations of boys were already in existence 
                  and circumcision could be made a splendid number. Man, who sought to 
                  raise himself to a level of order out of anarchical chaos, was even 
                  then induced to take social measures in his attempt to solve the questions 
                  of sex; he began to control the marriageable youths, their unbroken 
                  sexual instinct had to be, and was to be, checked by the primitive form 
                  of marriage. At this juncture nothing was more welcome than circumcision 
                  itself: the youth could actually be gagged: when circumcised he had 
                  a visible stamp from society for the concession of marriage and his 
                  maturity.(1) Uncircumcised he was still a child, unclean, neuter. Among 
                  many peoples the candidate for circumcision or novice appears decked 
                  out in feminine ornamentation (Nandi, Bryk, I pp. 118-119); among the 
                  Sluka (Rascher) he is treated like a bride; when called, he answers 
                  with the women's cry, never the men's (Bryk, 1, p. 99). He is an intermediate 
                  stage. 
          <P><FONT SIZE="2">1) The introduction of the custom of circumcision presupposes 
                    a time in which peoples still went about in a condition of nakedness.

          <P>But circumcision also has its severe disadvantages. It is painful and 
              more often than not was terminated by unintended, marked disfiguration; 
              indeed, even by death. Jewish prescriptions contain indications of these 
              facts. According to these, circumcision may not be performed with a 
              reed because (as a result of experience) "a portion of the penis could 
              be cut off". Even more remarkable is the provision cited by Preuss (p. 
              285) referring apparently to the circumcision of hemaphiliacs: "If two 
              children (according to R. Jehuda) or three (according to R. Simeon Ben 
              Gamliel) of the same mother have died as a result of circumcision, the 
              operation is to be omitted in the case of the third (or fourth). The 
              same is to be observed if a child of each of three sisters has died". 
          <P>I think the death of one child would have been sufficient to put this 
                provision into effect. 
          <P>It is no wonder that the marriageable youth, considering the fear circumcision 
                  must have exercised, resisted the establishment of the new custom. It 
                  can be determined almost exactly, even among the Jews, how long it took 
                  for the custom of circumcision to become firmly established. The young 
                  people generally offered opposition to it and had to be coerced by means 
        of whippings, threats of death and torture.         </TD></TR></TABLE>

        <P><FONT SIZE="2">Experts have been unable to understand the origin of the practice of routine 
          male circumcision. Most of the literature shows no awareness 
          of phimosis - its frequency - or the sexual and erectile problems which can be cured by circumcision. If routine circumcision 
          had been introduced for this most obvious reason of eliminating difficult 
          foreskins; then the importance of an alternative modern method, suitable to our culture's attitudes in this day and age, would be clear. </FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

        <P> I sympathise with Berger - a second person with a second perspective 
          can often present fresh ideas - Bryk was a flowing writer with a fine 
          sense for academic argumentation and by and large the English translation 
          is fine - but small mistakes do not do justice to the line of reasoning, 
          and it sometimes makes hard reading - David Berger often writes using 
          German syntax, for example:

        <P>Heinrich Ploss (p. 368 f.) says the following on the purpose of circumcision: 
          "The purpose and aim of circumcision is to be found, in my opinion, 
          in the endeavor to correct nature, to come to its aid in its supposed 
          "aberrations" and to bring about a condition of the sexual organs considered 
          to be normal for adults, and which is seldom, if ever, found naturally 
          in small children, very often not yet accomplished by the age of puberty, 
          and the absence of which even extends into full maturity, perhaps a 
          disadvantage to sexual functions; it is an attempt to remove phimosis, 
          for a person afllicted with it is considered to be less capable of procreation. 
          In order to 
        <P>p. 138 
        <P>unterstand this, one must be cognizant of the transformation of the 
          penis that gradually takes place as a rule, even if not always, up to 
          the age when the individual becomes eapable of procreation. The foreskin, 
          which covers the glans, is always so formed in the infant that it may 
          be drawn back over the glans only with difnculty or actual foree; gradually, 
          in relation to the whole growing member (penis), it becomes much more 
          distensible at its opening, so that later it usually slips back by itself, 
          especially when the penis is in a state of erection. The new-born child, 
          consequently, regularly has a phimosis, i. e. such a lengthening of 
          the foreskin, together with a narrowness at its opening, that it cannot 
          be shoved back behind the crown of the glans (which in the adult is 
          conductive to ejaculation during coitus). 
        <P>If now, it was noticed everywhere, without question, also among primitive 
          peoples that are inapproachable and difficult to observe, that the youth 
          who is becoming a man not infrequently begins to have his glans free, 
          beeause the prepuce shifts back by itself' and comes to lie behind the 
          crown, and that also in the full grown man it is exceptional for the 
          glans to be covered by the foreskin during erection, the covering of 
          the glans by the prepuce appeared to be a condition that was not normal 
          and that ought early and universally to be correeted in advance 2. "I 
          consequently consider the original tendency of circumcision to have 
          been a surgical act of preparation for the sexual funetion of man. The 
          covering of the glans by the foreskin, always present in the youth to 
          a certain extent, the condition of phimosis present since earliest childhood, 
          was looked upon as more or less a hindrance to coitus, something to 
          be removed by surgical interfereiice. That is why it is that most people 
          cut or amputate 
        <P><FONT SIZE="2">1) as a rule boys anticipate this manually. (B.) </FONT> 
        <P><FONT SIZE="2">2) Ploss contradicts himself, since he says that the 
          prepuce shifts back by itself, and the glans is uncovered during erection; 
          there is thus no reason for circumci- sion. (B.) </FONT> 
        <P><FONT SIZE="2">2) Ploss does not contradict hiumself since he says 
          this <I>usually</I> is the case; he emphasises it is the appearance 
          and the fear of this in the childs phimosis, which motivated the operation. 
          (RS.)</FONT> 
        <P>p. 139 
        <P>the foreskin in that period of life when maturity for sexual sensation, 
          puberty, has been arrived at3; there is the desire to make the youth 
          fully mature and normal sexually all at once. Thus an act is performed 
          whereby the young man is also received into the ranks of the mature, 
          marriageable men; it is bound up with certain ceremonies that symbolize 
          this reception; let one also keep in mind the pain caused by the operation 
          on the very sensitive masculine sexual organ, which is looked upon as 
          a kind of test of manly staunchness. But this operation, preparing the 
          individual for sexual maturity, is also performed at a very early age, 
          e. g. by the Jews and Mohammedans; here it is felt that the Kondition 
          of natural unreadiness is to be counteracted in the infant. It is desired 
          to guarantee even to the child as great an issue as possible and not 
          to rely on chance whether the phimosis observed and probably a hindrance 
          to procreation will once disappear of itself or remain constant. Then 
          it was looked upon as a deed pleasing to God; for the Jews considered 
          it very valuable in itself to have numerous offspring. "It is . . . 
          not to be denied that the absence of the foreskin, be it the result 
          of congenital malformation, accidental removal or purposed Amputation, 
          affords many more advantages than disadvantages, lessening on the one 
          hand the sensitivity of the glans, on the other, the tendency toward 
          excoriation and inflammation. The cleanliness of the surface of the 
          glans may more easily be maintained, the collection and disintegration 
          of mucous (smegma) is prevented, gonorrhoea of the glans is avoided 
          and eruptions (especially syphilitic) cannot become so easily established. 
          Therefore many physicians are of the opinion that the consideration 
          of all these advantages and disadvantages was, in its time, perhaps 
          the only reason for the introduction of circumcision, and that That 
          is, at the age when the foreskin already "shifts back by ltself." (B.) 
          139 
        <P>p. 140 
        <P>in the Orient and warm countries was indeed justified entirely by the 
          constrieted state of the foreskin. "In respect to this view I must again 
          emphasize that it is only in very few cases that the definite and actual 
          purpose of taking hygienie precautionary measures is openly expressed 
          in the introduction and execution of circumcision, only very few peoples, 
          e. g. the Samoans, speeifically emphasizing sanitary considerations, 
          the furtherance of cleanliness, etc. An uncommonly large number of peoples 
          that practice circumcision, show, on the contrary, very little passion 
          for cleanliness, and it is hardly to be assumed that they make an exception 
          of the masculine organ in particular. There must be another psychic 
          motive that induced them to undertake the operation".

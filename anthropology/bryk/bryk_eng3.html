          male circumcision. Most of the literature shows no awareness 
          of phimosis - its frequency - or the sexual and erectile problems which can be cured by circumcision. If routine circumcision 
          had been introduced for this most obvious reason of eliminating difficult 
          foreskins; then the importance of an alternative modern method, suitable to our culture's attitudes in this day and age, would be clear. </FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

          <P>If the question is to be treated with thoroughness all mutilations 
              and manipulations of the masculine organ must be discussed. The concept 
              of circumcision must not be made too exclusive, or its history would 
              deal entirely with the highly specialized operation of the penis, and 
              the primitive operations out of which it arose or which it supplanted, 
              but which certainly belong to the circumcision complex, would not be 
              expressed. 
          <P>Zeller (p. 131) comprehends the following five kinds of manipulations 
                of the masculine sexual organ under the general concept of circumcision. 
          <P>1. Incision (<I>incisio</I>) <BR>
            2. Perforation (<I>perforatio</I>) <BR>
            3. Circumcision (<I>circumcisio vera</I>) <BR>
            4. Subincision (<I>introcisio</I>) <BR>
            5. Testicular extirpation (<I>exstirpatio testiculi</I>) 
          <P>p. 121 
          <P>As a general characteristic of these five kinds of more or less severe 
                      mutilations Zeller mentions the purely secondary parallel phenomenon 
            "that they are always amid special ceremonies. Often, to be sure, only 
                      quite insignificant survivals of these rites are present, especially 
                      where commerce predominates. But from these survivals one may with certainty 
                      conclude previous important ceremonies, for in the course of time, usages 
                      may change or even disappear in part and leave only indications behind." 
          <P>Von Movorka (p. 131) differentiates the following operations performed 
                        on the masculine organ according to the part affected: 
          <P>a) <I>Discissio urethrae </I>(slitting open of the urinary tube - <I>urethrotomia 
                          externa</I>). <BR>
            ... 1) <I>totalis</I> (mika operation) <BR>
            ... 2) <I>partial splitting </I>(also for purely medical reasons according 
                          to von Steinen) <BR>
            b) <I>Perforatio penis</I> (Ampallang) <BR>

              performed circumcision; also the manipulations under XII and XIV may 
              appear in combination. For the present, we shall leave several varieties 
              undiscussed, especially all the non-bloody ones (because they fit better 
              into the framework of the exposition in a later place), and detail only 
              those forms of mutilation which are absolutely necessary for the understanding 
              of the explanations taken into account by psychoanalysis. 
          <P> TESTICULAR EXTIRPATION <BR>
            It was old Kolbe (p. 420) who was the first to give us a detailed report 
            on partial castration among the Hottentots, which is no longer practiced 
            today. Frobenius has authenticated it for East Africa and even Algiers 
            (but here only in mythology). L. Schultze, however, is somewhat skeptical 
            about this supposedly universal custom of the Hottentots; he writes-. 
            "I have never found the masculine organ circumcised in any part (l). 
          <P><FONT SIZE="2">1. On the other hand, Luschan's reports assert the occurrence 
                  of a form of circumcision (B.)</FONT> 
          <P>"The old reports of the alleged custom among the Hottentots of removing 
                    one testicle from the maturing youth can no longer be verified today. 
                    Perhaps these old reports had their origin in a medical measure of the 
                    Hottentots, which Kroenlein (Wortschatz der Khoikoin, 1889, p. 202) 
                    noted approximately fifty years ago: excision of one testicle as a cure 
                    for lumbago. But perhaps an old mythological conception is the basis 
                    for this also: For the <I>raphe scroti</I> was found the strange designation 
            <I>ginas om daob</I>, i. e. the path (<I>da-ob</I>) or seam that the 
                    fly (<I>ginas</I>) has sewn. The word indubitably is based on the conception 
                    of an opened scrotum. It was probably formed as a result of the first 
                    astonished sight of the raphe and an imaginative explanation given it 
                    in a myth, like that of the moon and the hare for harelip (Lit. 81, 
        p. 448), or the         </TD></TR></TABLE>

          <P>Testicular extirpation among the Bergdama Families is mentioned by 
                Walk (p. 886). 
          <P>Since the report of Kolbe has been repeatedly reprinted in most works 
                  dealing with the sex life of primitives, I quote one less well known 
                  on artificial monorchism among the inhabitants of the island of Panope.(1) 
            "According to the assurance of a white man who had been living on the 
                  island for some time, a sailor, the men content themselves with one 
                  testicle; at the early age of seven to eight years all boys have their 
                  left testicle extirpated by means of a sharpened piece of bamboo. This 
                  is said to occur because they believe that they can thus forever prevent 
                  any possible case of orchitis, and also, because the girls find one 
                  testicled men better looking and more attractive. My guarantor assured 
                  me that all the Ponapesians that he had had the chance to see naked, 
                  possessed only the right testicle, and this was confirmed by another 
                  sailor who had likewise lived on this island for some time." 
          <P><FONT SIZE="2">1) "I have subsequently received full confirmation from 
                    a third source, so that there can be no doubt at all," Finsch also learned 
                    from Captain Wright that the same custom was prevalent on the Island 
                    of Ninatabuitabu (one of the Friendship Islands) &quot;where almost 
                    every twenty-year-old youth possessed only one testicle." Boys vie with 
                    one another as to who shall be operated upon first. Neither Wright nor, 
                    Finsch mention ceremonies in connection with testicular extirpation. 
                    </FONT> 
          <P>Finsch mentions the artificial production of the vagina hypertelica 
                      by means of plucking, licking and biting (!) by the men, indeed, even 
            "by the bite of a large black ant, which, as I experienced myself, causes 
                      a pricking sensation". 
          <P>The purpose of partial excision given by the natives is interesting, 
                        that the "women, prefer intercourse with semi-castrated men", and that 
            "such men are said to have greater endurance in coitu (2)."

              speaks of a castration complex among children when they think of circumcision, 
              he probably means by that the <I>amputatio penis</I> and not castration. 
          <P>Pelikan has collected all the motives for castration known to him, 
                but has not exactly mentioned in the individual cases whether phallotomy 
                occurred or not. It may be assumed that in the cases of punishment mentioned 
                by him, the abscission of the penis, was also performed, and that alone. 
                There is a very remarkable case of a castration sect in Russia, the 
                Skopetzes, who for purely religious reasons have recourse to such fearful 
                auto-mutilation (1). It may be of value to the psychologist for the 
                deeper understanding of this problem if I describe a latent psychic 
                phenomenon which with any long term external impulse, would inevitably 
                lead to amputatio penis. In my youth 1 heard an old monomaniac man (a 
                paranoiac?) say the following while urinating, "I'll cut it off! Why 
                should the branch rule the tree?" 
          <P><FONT SIZE="2">1) According to Pelikan the various degrees of castration 
                  are termed as follows among the Skopetzes: "Little seal"-removal of 
                  the testes; "Czar seal,&quot; "second purity,&quot; "second whitening," 
            "to mount the white horse"-removal of the testes and penis. </FONT> 
          <P>"The motives . . . lying behind castration, which we shall discuss 
                    here exclusively, are extremely varied throughout the ages. <BR>
            a) Eunuchs (2) are still in use today as servants in Oriental harems.

            <BR>
            2) According to Adler (p. 72) the Turkish Sultan Amurad II, after having 
            made the accidental observation that a gelding covered a mare, Introduced 
            the radical precautionary measure that from then on not those merely 
            castrated, i.e. deprived of testes, were to be used as harem guards, 
            but complete eunuchs, those whose entire external genitals had been 
            removed. (B.)</FONT> <BR>

            b) Semiramis is said to have had the weaklings among her subjects castrated 
            in order to prevent a weak generation from arising. <BR>
            c) There are known in the history of the Byzantine Empire many cases 
            of castration for political purposes, in order to assure a certain dynasty 
          of the throne.         </TD></TR></TABLE>

              preserve their rescant (soprano) voices for a longer time. <BR>
            e) In China this barbaric custom originated from pederastic prostitution. 
            <BR>
            f) In addition there should be reckoned here also individual cases of 
            castration for revenge and jealousy, for fear of syphilitic infection, 
            to free one's self from military service, during attacks of insanity, 
            and the like. Besides, it is well known that in former times castration 
            was exercised as a penalty for various criminal offences, rape, etc.".

            Also onanists and those tortured by pollutions are said to have themselves 
            castrated, just as nymphomaniac women undergo clitorectomy. (Laurent 
            & Nagour, p. 71.) <BR>
            g) Finally there is the castration sect of the Skopetzes (1) in Russia 
            who are the slaves of a religious dogma and which has its origin in 
            a misunderstanding of Christ's words: "For there are some eunuchs, which 
              were so born from their mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs, which 
              were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs which have made themselves 
              eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake". (Matth., XIX, 12.) <BR>

                  in Roman criminal law circumcision is identified with it or subordinated 
                  to it. According to Mommsen, "If performed with the consent of the castrated 
                  or his guardian, in former times castration was apparently exempt from 
                  punishment. Domitian prohibited it throughout the empire both for free

          <P>even with the consent of the person involved (at times punished by 
              death)." 
          <P>Circumcision was also severely punished because it was considered to 
                be a kind of castration. "Hadrian was the first one, not apparently 
                for religious reasons, but because of the superficial similarity of 
                the operations, to equate circumcision and castration, which was one 
                of the reasons that led to a serious Jewish insurrection at that time. 
                His successor granted it to the Jews and also the Egyptians. Otherwise, 
                however, circumcision was considered equal to castration, and equally 
                punished". Mommsen (p. 637.) 
          <P>Baumann goes so far as to maintain: "La castration, l'eunuchisme et 
                  la circoncision ne sont que de modifications amoindries l'une de l'autre". 
          <P>"Castration also existed among the Hebrews. Moses zealously combated 
                    this custom and went so far in his decree as even to forbid the castration 
                    of cattle". (Trusen, p. 94, Wunderbar, pp. 32-33.) 
          <P>According to Hirsch 'Celibacy and castration were to the Jewish theocracy 
                      abuses just as execrable as lust and debauchery". 
          <P>The origin of castration will not be discussed here in detail since 
                        that would take us too far from our main theme; it will be discussed 
                        only insofar as it shows points of similarity with circumcision. 
          <P>"The custom of circumcising only grown youths, still prevalent in many 
                          parts of Africa, may have favored the origin of this operation, by which 
                          it was sought to make harem guards of them, in connection with the great 
                          jealousy as a result of polygamy" is the opinion of Trusen (p. 94).

              open of the urinary tube for a more or less long distance to the <I>orificium 
                urethrae</I> (<I>introcisio, situbincisio</I>). Von Gennep says it is 
              not any more barbarous, nor any more symbolical, than the wide-spread 
              circumcision practices (Karsch, p. 73). Milne Robertson thinks it may 
              be derived from primitive vulnerary art in occasional cases of inflammation 
              of the urethra. (Karsch, p. 273.) A natural case of hypospadias could 
              have served as a model. According to Karsch (p. 74) the natives give 
              the following explanation: <BR>
            "Without the mika operation people are no better than dogs or other

                has other means of decimating the number of births - by infanticide 
                - the premise of the sterility of the subjects is false, since those

          <P>of a district, not only single individuals, undergo the Operation. 
              Klaatsch was the first to succeed in proving that subincision served 
              homo-erotic purposes. According to him the men of the tribe of Niol-Niol 
              (-called <I>Wamba</I>-) enter into a fervent, almost matrimonial relationship 
              with the not yet subincised youths and boys (-called <I>Walebel</I>). 
          <P>The <I>Wamba</I>, for the purpose of sexual satisfaction, extends the 
                slit in his urethra so that it remains open down to the scrotum. Now 
                the <I>walebel</I> (youth) places his penis in the subincised penis 
                and through constant friction succeeds in effecting an ejaculation of 
                semen on the part of both. 
          <P>From this information it can be seen why the subincised men of the 
                  Pitta-Pitta tribe are (according to Roth) called "<I>meko-maro</I>" 
            (vulva-possessors). 
          <P>Eylmann's report of the operation is very clear. According to him, 
                    subincision consists "entirely in the exposure of the urethra by incisions 
                    made on the under side of the penis which may reach from the scrotum 
                    to the terminal meatus. An assistant to the operator, who sits astride 
                    on the stomach of the boy that is being operated on, holds the latter's 
                    penis as taut as possible, the operator then performs the cuts in very 
                    few strokes. After an incision through the skin is made, the wound is 
                    extended by tearing apart the tissue with both thumbs, down to the urethra 
                    (Fig. 7). The patient does indeed become very weak through the severe 
                    bleeding, mainly of the erectile tissue surrounding the urethra, but 
                    permanent harm to the erectile tissue of the penis is avoided by the 
                    experienced operator. Also, for the more certain and convenient performance 
                    of the operation, a kangeroo bone is said to be inserted into the urethra. 
                    The operation is repeated in case the walls of the wound meet and grow 
                    together. The slit caused by the operation is only visible by lifting 
                    the member. But its presence can easily be detected by the almost double 
        circumference of the         </TD></TR></TABLE>

              the Australian possessed of such an artificial hypospadias". (Karsch, 
              p. 9.) 
          <P>Not all Australian tribes perform this mutilation of the penis in the 
                way described above. I refer to Walter E. Roth, who gives a description 
                of the operation quite different from that among the Pitta-Pitta and 
                Yaroinga. 
          <P> "The extent of the incision is not the same everywhere. Milne Robertson 
                  says that among the natives of the De Gray River the slit extended only 
                  from the meatus to the middle of the organ, but that among the negroes 
                  living on the north side of Murchison it went from the meatus down the 
                  whole length of the penis to the root of the scrotum. According to Creed, 
                  the operation is confined, among the Gawlian Australians of note, to 
                  a perforation of the ventral wall of the urethra in that part of the 
                  penis directly in front of the scrotum. 
          <P>"Among some tribes a single cut does not suffice. Thus the Undekerebina 
                    in Queensland make a transverse cut behind the longitudinal cut and 
                    the Yaringa, according to the same guarantor, even execute two longitudinal 
                    cuts in such a way that a flap of skin results that hangs down over 
                    a transverse cut made behind them". 
          <P>Miklucho-Maclay has adopted the designation "mika&quot; for the operation. 
        Later it was also called "subincision" and finally "introcision."         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                the latter being performed always earlier than the former. In the interior 
                the boys are circumcised when they have reached the age of fifteen to 
                seventeen years. The splitting follows either directly after the healing 
                of the wound, that is, after five or six weeks (Arunta), or first in 
                the course of the next year (Tjingale). A stone knife with a handle

          <P>resin is used for both operations between fifteen and twenty five degrees 
              latitude. Only on Lake Eyre, where such is no longer in their possession, 
              a sharp, shell-shaped stone splinter is used for this purpose. Also 
              among the tribes of the north coasts, where circumcision is customary, 
              the young boy must undergo it when he is about fifteen, sixteen or seventeen 
              years old. For the abscission of the foreskin, stone splinters are used 
              here also, since actual stone knives are not made. Among most tribes, 
              a living operating table, (if 1 may term it such) is used, formed by 
              two men lying one on top of the other with their backs upward. In order 
              to prevent the boy from crying out, a loin cloth or the like is stuffed 
              into his mouth, and to keep him from beating around and kicking, three 
              or four men hold him down. One of these sits astride on the stomach 
              of the boy during the operation. 
          <P>"So far as circumcision is concerned, the foreskin, while one assistant 
                holds it taut and another holds the penis at the root, is cut through 
                close to the glans by the operator. The Walwonga, in addition, are said 
                to tie it together with a string at its upper end. Among the northern 
                tribes, who know nothing of subincision, the patient preserves his foreskin

          <P>Father W. Schmidt gives us a very detailed description of this among 
                    the Karesau Islanders, of which we give only the more salient points: 
          <P>"After the house of spirits has been closed, the boy standing first 
                      in line is led by his godfather to a place situated a short distance 
                      from the seashore where two other men have already taken their position. 
                      None of the boys knows what is now to happen to him. When they arrive 
                      at the place, the godfather places the hands behind the latter's back 
                      and bends his head so far back and upwards, that the boy can see nothing 
                      of what goes on in front of him.
          <P>"One of the two men (priests) waiting there holds in his hand a dagger 
                        of cassowary bone, sharply pointed and about as wide as a moderately 
                        sized pen-holder. With this he pierces the boys penis at its tip (2) 
                        from above, so that the point of the dagger projects from the under 
                        side, and then withdraws the dagger; then he penetrates the penis again 
                        from the other side, but not so far as to make the tip of the dagger 
                        project beyond it, and then withdraws it again. "If the boy is very 
                        young, say eleven to thirteen years, then the operation is over now. 
                        But if he is older, the first man lifts the foreskin away from both

                first made an offering of betel and pepper or yams, etc., in front of 
                it, he is called to account by the natives of the village. If he says 
                that he has forgotten to, he is not believed; they doubt whether he 
                has ever been initiated at all, boys not initiated, - and no girls and 
                women at all - may ever enter the house of spirits - he is examined, 
                and if <I>amputatio praeputii</I> had never been performed on him, it 
                is now done forcibly. 
          <P>"A married man may, if he has had no children yet, go through the general 
                  ceremony of circumcision. But if he has children, his foreskin is amputated 
                  when he is not aware of it, and for the rest of his life he may visit 
                  the house of spirits only clandestinely, without the knowledge of his 
                  wife and children.

                    The bigger boys hold out staunchly without crying. But the smaller ones 
                    cry and yell and curse the men, looking for stones to throw at them 
                    and saying that it is "not nice" of them, that they will tell the women. 
                    Thereupon the men show them spears and daggers and threaten them with 
                    death if they tell. If a boy is especially unruly, he is pierced once 
                    more.

                      them lies down on the shore and cries, as the smaller ones in particular 
                      do, he is brusquely picked up and thrown into the water. Not until the 
                      last of them has entered the water may any of them leave it. "Then each

              the <I>amputatio praeputii</I> has been performed, this belt is not

                is connected with the concept of circumcision and is performed at the 
                concluding celebration. Father Schmidt writes: "In the meantime the 
                men have removed the stagnant water from one of the trough-shaped hollows 
                in the stone formed on the shore by the action of the waves, and filled 
                it with sweet water. <I>Tum penem sibi transfigunt</I> (<FONT SIZE="2">

                have fallen on the edge and coagulated there is also scraped in, so 
                that thick pieces float around in it. Finally one of the men tests it 
                by bending down and applying his lips to it to see whether there is 
                enough blood there. 
          <P>"The boys must now drink out of this trough, lying down and sipping 
                  up the mixture with their mouths.

          <P>Risa tells of an exceedingly barbaric custom prevalent among the Yesidis 
                  in Vilajet Assir in Yemen: "Circumcision is performed by them in the 
                  fifteenth to twentieth year; a strip of skin is removed from the navel 
                  to the anus, including the skin of the penis and scrotum". It is performed 
            <I>coram publico</I> in a standing position, the patient holding on 
                  to a lance. "The circumcisor kneels before him and severs the skin with 
                  a blunt knife, strand after strand, each time showing the trophy to 
                  the populace that is gathered about. The one being circumcised may not 
                  cry out nor wail or he would be despised and forsaken by his bride, 
                  who witnesses the procedure. Hot oil is put on the wound. People often 
                  die of the consequences, many leave the tribe".

          <P>Heinrich Ploss (p. 368 f.) says the following on the purpose of circumcision: 
              "The purpose and intention of this operation lies, in my opinion, in 
                the endeavour to correct nature. To help her with her supposed &quot;mistakes&quot; 
              and to bring about a state on the sexual organ which one considers to 
              be normal in adults. Such a state clearly never occurs of its own accord 
              when left to nature among small children, and still does not develop 
              spontaneously very often during puberty. On the other hand, it is not 
              at all uncommon for such states to continue until adulthood causing 
              difficulties during sexual activity. They wanted to eliminate phimosis, 
              because they considered a man with such a defect was less able to have 
              children.

          <P>understand this it must be pointed out which process of change usually, 
              if not always, occurs in the penis up until the time when procreation 
              is possible. Among new born children, the foreskin covering the glans 
              is always so formed that it is only with difficulty or force that it 
              can be retracted over the glans. After a period of time in relationship 
              to the development of the entire member, (the penis), the foreskin becomes 
              a lot more elastic around its opening, so that later, in fact when the 
              penis is in the erect state, in the majority of cases the foreskin folds 
              back automatically.
          <P>It is thus quite normal for a new born child to possess a phimosis 
                i.e. an elongation of the foreskin combined with a narrowness of the 
                opening, such that the retraction of this behind the corona of the glans 
                (which is profitable for a man in order to ejaculate when performing 
            coitus); is not possible.</P>
          <P>If (everywhere, without question even among the insufficiently or inadequately 
            observant natural peoples); the fact had been noticed that sometimes 
            youths (when they grow up to adulthood), may begin to carry the glans 
            naked (because the prepuce retracts automatically (1) and remains behind 
            the corona); and in addition among men, the glans is still only abnormally 
            covered by the foreskin during an erection; therefore the foreskin covering 
            the glans appears to be an abnormal state of affairs, which one must 
            quite routinely take counter measures against and correct in good time 
            (2). </P>

          <P><FONT SIZE="2">2) Ploss contradicts himself, since he says that the 
              prepuce shifts back by itself, and the glans is uncovered during erection; 
              there is thus no reason for circumcision. (B.) </FONT>

          <P>"With this, I conclude that the original predisposition towards circumcision 
                  was the operational preparation for the sexual function of the man. 
                  One considers the child's foreskin, which has to some extent remained 
                  covering the glans, since earliest childhood regardless of everything, 
                  the persisting narrow condition of the phimosis; as being more or less 
                  an obstacle to coitus, which one must correct with a surgical operation.

          <P>the foreskin, once the age of puberty, (when the maturity for the enjoyment 
              of sex) has been reached(3); with this one decisive act they wanted 
              to make the boy completely mature and normal in the sexual sense. 
          <P><FONT SIZE="2">3) That is, at the age when the foreskin already "shifts 
                back by itself." (B.)</FONT> 
          <P>It is thus, an act which is conducted, whereby one takes the young 
                  person in as an equal among the group of mature, marryable men; and 
                  at the same time one combines this act with certain ceremonies, symbolic 
                  of this initiation; by which, with respect to the pain (that this forthcoming 
                  operation causes to the very sensitive male sexual organ), one wishes 
            to develop a form of test on the masculine fortitude.</P>
          <P>This singular operation which prepares for sexual adulthood, is practised 
            by the Jews and Muslims among others, at quite an early age; here one 
            believes it is necessary to fight against this natural state of incompleteness 
            as soon as the child is born.</P>
          <P>They want even the child to be assured the possibility of numerous 
            offspring and not leave it to chance, if the phimosis which had been 
            noticed on him, (which could perhaps hinder procreation); will resolve 
            naturally by itself or if it will remain in the future. Thus it becomes 
            regarded as a work which is pleasing to God: then it was held in itself 
            by the Jews for highly worthwhile to have numerous offspring.</P>
          <P> In this respect, one cannot contradict that the lack of the foreskin; 
            (if this is the result of either a congenital malformation, a chance 
            injury, or if it has been purposefully removed); has far more advantages 
            than disadvantages in that on the one hand the high sensitivity of the 
            glans, on the other the susceptibility to injuries and infections would 
            be removed.</P>
          <P>The cleaning of the surface of the glans becomes easier, the collection 
            and decomposition of fungal mould (Smegma) is hindered, gonorrhoea is 
            avoided and sores (namely Syphilis) are less likely to find footing. 
            For this reason some doctors are of the opinion &quot;that the weighing 
            up of all these advantages and disadvantages in those times could have 
            been the sole reason for introducing circumcision, and that therefore

          <P>"Against this view, (as I have already mentioned), I must again raise 
                the point, that only in few cases were precautionary health measures 
                openly expressed, or otherwise came to light as the definite and true 
                intention behind the introduction and practice of circumcision; in that 
                only among individual peoples e.g. the Samoaner, sanitary considerations, 
                encouragement of cleanliness etc., were expressly emphasised.
          <P>An extraordinary large number of peoples who practice circumcision, 
                  show in fact little passion for cleanliness and it is therefore hardly 
                  likely that as an exception, they wished specifically the man's penis 
                  to be particularly clean. There must be another psychological motive 
            which moved them to adopt the operation.". </P>

          <P>Richard Andree (pp. 166-212) takes the same position as Ploss on the 
            question, whom he quotes at the end of his exposition. But he makes 
            a reservation for the American aborigines. "The view that the abscission 
            of the foreskin is a sacrifice for the gods, indeed, even a substitution 
            for human sacrifice, has repeatedly been expressed, and seems, at least 
            for America, not to be unfounded ... 
          <P>"For these ... peoples it appears to me to be quite certain that the 
              idea of sacrifice was decisive and the cause of the introduction of 
              circumcision. If the main factor had been, in America, as it is among 
              most peoples, the preparation for procreation, circumcision would be 
              much more wide-spread in that portion of the earth. But, as a matter 
              of fact, it occurs only sporadically and is always connected with blood 
              sacrifices and religious ceremonies. In general, however, I still must 
              negate that one cause led to circumcision, but that beyond doubt, among 
              a number of peoples the idea of sacrifice also led to this. However 
              among the majority another point of view for its introduction was present, 
        a point         </TD></TR></TABLE>

              found once more."". 
          <P>Andree disagrees with the opinion of an originally religious character 
                of circumcision, as it is still manifested among the Jews, as well as 
                with the explanation suggested by von Autenrieth, and the hygienic precautionary 
                measures of the operation. 
          <P>Heinrich Schurtz (1, p. 96 f.) expresses a view similar to that of 
                  Ploss: "Directly connected with the sexual freedom which the boys enjoy 
                  from now on, there is in the main only one very wide-spread custom, 
                  that of circumcision, the purpose of which probably is, despite all 
                  profound hypotheses, merely that of facilitating cohabitation, and at 
                  any rate, to have a hygienic effect ... 
          <P>" ... the custom of circumcision, which, in its various forms, probably 
                    had the original purpose of facilitating sexual intercourse (1), and 
                    which was only gradually here and there, as among the Jews, supported 
                    by secondary reasons, was shifted to the early days of the child's life". 
                    (II, p. 119.) 
          <P><FONT SIZE="2">1) lt is thus admitted that the uncircumcised cohabit 
                      with difficulty. (B.) </FONT> 
  <P>Otto Stoll (p. 543 ff.) gives a very detailed foundation for the 
    concept of circumcision in his excellent work, differentiating two 
    distinct groups of phenomena attendant upon the operation. "The first 
    group includes those cases in which an intentional and specific operation 
    is involved, confined to the genital apparatus and conditioned by its 
    real or supposed physiological role. A classical example of this kind, 
    is the circumcision of the Jews. In addition we should include here 
    the partial testicular extirpation of the Hottentots. 
  <P>"In the second, larger group, the mutilations practiced on the genitalia 
    form only one part of a whole series of bloody operations having the 
    character of initiation ceremonies; the specific element recedes more 
    or less into the         </TD></TR></TABLE>

          <P>background and it is only by chance (?B.), so to speak, that the genital 
              apparatus is operated on, together with the perforation of the ears 
              and nose, and the basis for scar ornamentation: in this case it is simply 
              another point that can be operated on without endangering the life of 
              the individual ... 
          <P>"It is probable that this second, larger group still represents the 
                original situation and that the cases of the first group, in which the 
                bloody procedure is confined to the genital apparatus, have developed 
                only secondarily out of similar ones in the first; the coarse practices 
                such as copious incision in the skin, breaking out of the teeth, etc., 
                being abandoned with increasing civilization or being gradually displaced 
                by milder forms, such as the simple piercing of the lobe of the ear 
                or the column or sides of the nose, while the operations performed on 
                the genitalia received a specific stamp as a result of the insight into 
                its physiological significance ... 
          <P> "If we sought to discover the psychological factors basic to the cases 
                  of the second group, we should have to seek for them in the following 
                  general situation: 
          <P>"l. The indifference to foreign bodily pain prevailing among primitive 
                    peoples. "This indifference is documented particularly and most strikingly 
                    in the not only coarse but often actually cruel treatment of animals 
                    of all kinds, even domestic animals, in their use for service and also 
                    slaughtering and sacrifice. We have here a universal trait of the human 
                    soul which is characteristic not only of "primitive" peoples, but just

          <P>1 quote, according to Zeller (pp. 101-103) the views on circumcision 
                    of Renz that differ from those of Ploss. Renz sees in circumcision an 
                    act of the sex or fertility cult, starting from those peoples that tie 
                    up circumcision with more or less complicated forms of the tree, post, 
                    fire, water and serpent cults. At the bottom of all these cults is an 
                    apotheosis of fertility. Circumcision is also the official initiation 
                    into the sex life also among those peoples who do not practice the cults 
                    mentioned above. Among races who revere the amputated prepuce (or other 
                    objects connected with circumcision), as a powerful means of procreation 
                    and carry them about on themselves, one of the factors in the motivation 
                    for circumcision is the desire for numerous offspring. But a purely 
                    sexual purpose is also possible, some races expecting from circumcision 
                    an intensification of sexual feeling during copulation " 
          <P>An argument in favor of its sexual significance is the fact that among 
                      most peoples, including the followers of Mohammed, it is performed during 
        the age of puberty.         </TD></TR></TABLE>

          <P>"Here and there circumcision is looked upon as an act of expiation 
              and purification, which does not necessarily have to refer to sexual 
              sins that are to be atoned for, but may mean any evil". 
          <P>Renz (p. 412) says: "Very remarkable is the conception of circumcision 
                as a rebirth from the stomach or belly of a spirit. The hut of isolation, 
                in which the boys must spend a long time, serves as the belly of the 
                spirit. It is not always necessary for the rebirth or transformation, 
                any enclosure or secret place serving the same purpose". 
          <P>Here Renz adds the following footnote: "I have just obtained a copy 
                  of Frazer's "The Golden Bough" in the third edition (1911), in which 
                  the author expresses the hope of having found the long lost key to the 
                  significance of circumcision, i. e. Frazer thinks that rebirth is the 
                  original and universally valid significance of circumcision. Frazer 
                  adopted this view because the . . . east African Kikuyu had formerly 
                  bound up their circumcision with the ceremonies of an ostensible rebirth, 
                  which are now celebrated separately, and because . . . in Central Australia 
                  the amputated foreskins are put into the same totem-trees, totem-rocks 
                  and other totem-centers in which human souls spend the time between 
                  their departure from the dying individual and their rebirth in a child. 
          <P>"Frazer's points of departure do not of course depreciate mine, but 
                    rather strengthen them. The rich symbolism of the nations prefers to 
                    express the same thought in manifold forms. But if Frazer believes that 
                    the significance of the rebirth lies in the magic powers of a spirit 
                    being conferred upon the candidate, or the fictitious birth (rebirth) 
                    actually allowing him a real rebirth (after real death) on earth, then 
                    I doubt it. According to my exposition above . . . it would rather be 
                    much more plausible that the nations wish to express by such rebirth 
                    ceremonies that the individual circumcised or to be received into the 
        ranks of the adults, is from now on a dif-         </TD></TR></TABLE>

              and duties than formerly, that he has now experienced a sexual, social 
              and religious rebirth". 
          <P>On the concept of the covenant, as manifests in Mosaic circumcision, 
                and the bond of friendship among those circumcised at the same time 
                in other races, Renz writes further (p. 144): "If we are surprised to 
                find that the circumcised organ of procreation is the sign of a covenant 
                of tribe or nation, and that the operation is the time best fitted for 
                concluding life-long friendships, this surprise disappears if we think 
                of the apotheosis of the power of procreation among polytheistic races 
                and the high regard in which it is held among monotheists". 
          <P>Renz observes finally (pp. 148-149): "My former expositions also give 
                  the impression that among most peoples circumcision of boys appears 
                  as a preparation for the sexual functions. And yet this impression is 
                  not cogent because it provokes the question: do not the circumcised 
                  nations in their intercourse with the uncircumcised see that they have 
                  no advantage over them either in the power of procreation, or health 
                  and cleanliness or socio-political unity? 
          <P>"But Andree has already noticed this difficulty in the solution of 
                    the problem: he thinks, on the other hand, that circumcision did not 
                    receive a religious significance until it was already present and its 
                    possible wholesomeness tested. 
          <P>"But circumcision does not seem to have stood the test, and we should 
                      be justified in assuming that the great dissemination of circumcision 
                      was founded on an erroneous overestimation of its effect on procreation. 
          <P>"However, its religious character cannot be denied among the greatest 
                        number of races even accepting the last assumption and in spite of its 
                        being called antiquated, if one sees religion in its broadest sense; 
        that is, in the sense of the sex cult with its numerous forms, and that         </TD></TR></TABLE>

          <P>one indeed must, if he conceives polytheism to be a form of religion, 
              which is not to be disproved. 
          <P>"The covenant, procreation, rebirth, expiation and religion contradict 
                one another as little in the monotheistic concept of religion as they 
                do in the polytheistic. The various results that have come from the 
                researches on the reason and purpose or significance of circumcision 
                are to be looked upon rather as mutually complementary than as contradictory". 
          <P>The fact that the initiation rites of boys are almost always bound 
                  up with pedagogical tortures has led Kulischer to make the following, 
                  probably somewhat exaggerated, statement: "Among the African tribes 
                  we find the same tortures at the time of puberty that we find among 
                  the American peoples, with the difference that in Africa the tortures 
                  have assumed a more definite form: the form of circumcision". 
          <P>. Le Roy (p. 236) sees in circumcision an "<I>interdit leve</I>"; only 
                    through the blood sacrifice of mutilation of the penis can the "<I>permis 
                      d'user</I>" be bought. Reik (p. 981) is of the opinion "that the prohibition 
                    -the partial lifting of which is bound up with the rites of puberty 
                    - was first set up within the narrow frame of the family and only later 
                    extended beyond these limits". 
          <P>To consider circumcision simply as a detail of the rites of puberty 
                      is untenable; not because it is practiced by many peoples without any 
                      ceremonies at all - the rites could have disappeared in the course of 
                      time for other cultic, social or practical reasons - but because the 
                      majority of races get along without any circumcision in their initiation 
                      of boys. The fact that it has associated itself with the other ceremonies 
                      in the initiation of boys does not justify the conclusion that it represents 
                      simply an episode -and the most important one, too - of the celebration, 
                      that it is to be explained solely from initiation rites and had arisen 
        from them. Circumcision arose         </TD></TR></TABLE>

          <P>independently from quite other considerations, was then taken up by 
              the men's societies, which, according to Thurnwald, represent the first 
            "tangible form of state formation" into the already present initiation 
              rites of boys, just as it was incorporated by the Israelites into the 
              covenant. Since circumcision is in itself a painful operation, as are 
              also the separate phases of the initiation rites, the common characteristics 
              of excruciation and torture was considered by many authors, and particularly 
              by psychoanalysts, to be most fundamental. Even if primitive man did 
              perhaps incorporate the institution of circumcision in the ceremony 
              of initiation simply because it was another item in the torture of the 
              boys, still one can by no means conclude that it arose for this purpose, 
              still less out of this motive. 
          <P>All initiations of boys show very many like and related characteristics; 
                excruciation, torture and subjection is one of the most essential of 
                them. The boys are often bullied by all kinds of "fairy tales" which 
                they perhaps, or even probably, believe to be true, but after they have 
                gone through the initiation rites they see clearly their fictitious 
                and false nature. Ethnology furnishes many examples of this. 
          <P>Thus, among the Nandi, a lion is brought before the circumcised novices. 
            <BR>
            "It is dark. A lion comes and roars, "guh, guh". He (the boy) trembles 
                  with fright. But soon he becomes angry because he sees that the people 
                  have been fooling him. They come and show him an earthenware vessel. 
                  'What is this?' they ask. 'A pot,' he answers. 'That is the lion,' is 
                  what he now hears." (Bryk, I p. 59.) The totem animal he had previously 
                  feared now suddenly turns out to be nothing but humbug. Such simulations 
                  are, unfortunately, still to be found among ourselves; they play a large 
                  part in the upbringing of children, when the latter are told about the 
        "bogeyman",         </TD></TR></TABLE>

          <P>etc. or about the stork (totem animal?) who brings the children. 
          <P>Reik (pp. 76-77) gives a very crass example of this conscious swindling 
                and misleading of novices. It makes one think of the superior smile 
                of the Roman prophets. "Sincethey have received the youngsters 
                into their company, the men, who have safeguarded themselves for such 
                a long time against their growing sons by means of intimidating them, 
                do not now continue to spurn them, but grant them a peek behind the 
                scenes. Thus the women and children of Central Australia are still frightened 
                by the whirring of the bullroarer, which is alleged to be the voice 
                of the mythical being Tuanjiraka. Among many tribes the men themselves 
                give the boys such sticks after circumcision and explain the secret 
                to them. This happens among the Aranda, as the missionary Carl Strehlow 
                relate (1), in the following words: 'We have always told you that it 
                was Tuanjiraka that caused you pain. You shall now discard the belief 
                in Tuanjiraka and believe instead that this is Tuanjiraka. We have told 
                you, women and children only about the bullroarer (<I>nankara</I>) and 
                have only compared Tuanjiraka with it. As we have done so shall you 
                again and again tell the children (about Tuanjiraka), in order that 
                the news may not spread (that there is no Tuanjiraka). Or we should 
                all disappear from the earth and it would be heard under the whole sky 
                we died out. Just as we, the circumcised, you must never spread it, 
                in order that this news never be told to the children. Keep the tyurunga 
                (bullroarer) secret and continue to tell the children about Tuanjiraka. 
                As your forefathers, so are you also now become a man. Keep it for yourself. 
                lf the children were to learn about it, you would become sick to death. 
                Just as we, so shall you also lie and say, 'There is indeed a Tuanjiraka'.

              particularly, that forced them to have the demon play its part. Their 
              advice to follow their example, as well as the warning given with it, 
              that those who have now become men would otherwise become sick and die, 
              and the tribe die out too, is, if one seizes its unconscious significance, 
              fully justified, because if these protective measures fell, then the 
              young people would give themselves up entirely to their rebellious feelings 
              and kill their fathers; the tribe would perish in the struggle between 
              both generations. 
          <P>"It must also be pointed out that in the legends of the Semitic races 
                of antiquity there appears the same shifting on to the gods that demand 
                circumcision as is to be found among primitives. Among the Jews Yahweh 
                has issued the command for this measure; the patriarchs, as representatives 
                of the paternal generation, perform it (Abraham, Joshua). The Aranda 
                of Central Australia, like the Jewish myths, derive the introduction 
                of circumcision (and subincision) from divine beings: Margarkunjerkunja, 
                who articulated to the people of primeval times, introduced the operation; 
                when it fell into oblivion or was performed badly, two hawk-men came 
                from the north who executed it with a stone knife on the men who lived 
                in the south".(1) <BR>

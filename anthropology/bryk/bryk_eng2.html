          male circumcision. Most of the literature shows no awareness 
          of phimosis - its frequency - or the sexual and erectile problems which can be cured by circumcision. If routine circumcision 
          had been introduced for this most obvious reason of eliminating difficult 
          foreskins; then the importance of an alternative modern method, suitable to our culture's attitudes in this day and age, would be clear. </FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

          <P><B>SUGGESTED EXPLANATIONS </B> </P>
          <P> The explanations of the purpose and cause of circumcision, here quoted 
            in detail for comparison, furnish a splendid example of the versatility 
            of human extravagant imagination, and are, at the same time, a document 
            of the ambivalent validity of casuistic argumentation. Consequently 
            the explanations of this still enigmatical operation often not only 
            supplement, but contradict one another in every way. As a few examples 
            will demonstrate: the purpose of circumcision is to make masturbation 
            impossible (Sachtleben) or the contrary, it favors masturbation (Salomon); 
            it leads to pederasty, or it is a preventive against it (Risa); it makes 
            people virtuous or the opposite; it has been introduced for the refining 
            of the sexual act, etc., etc. 
  <P>The problem of circumcision is stated and answered according to 
    the subjective attitude of the author or the peoples in question, and 
    there is probably no crasser contrast in the evaluation of this custom 
    than when, on the one side, it is praised as something well-nigh divine, 
    and on the other, rejected as being somewhat barbaric (Levit). However 
    this is not primarily a matter of ethical judgement, which would only 
    cloud the main issue; the question may only be put as: how did man 
    arrive at the idea of mutilating his penis, and why? What was the first 
    incentive for it? It is of uncommon interest for the psychologist to 
    learn how gradually with the spread and development of circumcision, 
    the general conception of its nature changed and incidental motives 
    entirely pushed aside the original incentive. This brings us no nearer 
    the main issue. However, one must know the various conceptions before 
    he can attempt to answer our question. I therefore quote the various 
    authors in historical sequence. I begin with Philo, the Hellenistic 
    Jew of the first century of our era. 
  <P>Philo gives "several reasons for inducing the maintenance of this old 
    custom", especially four: "First, in order to prevent a serious and 
    malignant disease, which - from the burning pains and inflammation, 
    I surmise it to be gonorrhoea - is called carbuncle, a disease which 
    the uncircumcised succumb to more easily. 
    <P>"Second, on account of the complete cleanliness of the body, which 
      beseems the priestly order, for which reason also, the highest Egyptian 
      priests attended to their bodies with great care, for underneath the 
      hair as well as underneath the foreskin, dirt collects and remains, 
      which must be removed. 
      <P>"Third, in order that this circumcised part have a certain similarity 
        to the heart, for both organs serve to procreate. For the spirit that 
        dwells in the heart is an organ of perception just as are the genitalia 
        of animals. Therefore the ancients considered it right to make this 
        visible part, which is the fountain of physical perceptions, similar 
        to that hidden, nobler part, which is the fountain of spiritual perceptions. 
        <P>"The fourth reason, and the most cogent, is the care for fruitfulness 
          and numerous offspring. For they say that the semen is ejaculated without 
          hindrance(1) and does not lose itself in the folds of the foreskin: 
          thus are the circumcised nations mighty in fruitfulness and the most 
          populous. These are the reasons that have come to 
          <P><FONT SIZE="2">1) Bastide tells of a case of sterility that was cured 
            by the operation of circumcision. (Rawitzki in Glasberg, p. XVIII.)

          <P>my ears, handed down by divine men, who have diligently studied the 
              teachings of Moses. 
          <P>"But besides the reasons given for circumcision, I think I ought to 
                give two more on account of their great importance: first, the excision 
                of the passions, which bind the mind. For since among all passions that 
                of intercourse between man and woman is greatest, the lawgivers have 
                commanded that the instrument which serves this intercourse, be mutilated, 
                pointing out that these powerful passions must be bridled, and thinking 
                that not only this, but all passions would be controlled through this 
                one. Second, in order that they thus be advised to know themselves and 
                discard arrogance, that grave disease of the soul. Many boast themselves 
                to be creators, to a certain extent, in that they can create man, the 
                fairest of animals, and proud of this, declare themselves gods, even 
                by denying God as the author of all creation. And yet they could correct 
                this error if they looked at the other things they make use of. For 
                many men among them are sterile (and many women unfruitful), who have 
                grown old, childless through feeble intercourse. This perverse idea 
                must be rooted out of the soul, as also everything else that is in any 
                way opposed to piety". 
          <P>What is noteworthy in this work of Philo, which is, not only one of 
                  the first attempts at an explanation of the history of circumcision, 
                  but which also raises a great number of stimulating thoughts on the 
                  question, is, that Philo is conscious of the fact that he gives us nothing 
                  on the motive, the reason for circumcision, but only the reason for 
                  its retention. He speaks of a custom that is already old, which he presents 
                  as already given: he puts before us a <I>fait accompli,</I> exactly 
                  as the Old Testament does: "Go, and circumcise the flesh of your foreskin". 
                  But what the sense of circumcision is, why it is the penis that is chosen 
        to be the bearer of the sign of the covenant with         </TD></TR></TABLE>

            does not. 
          <P> We shall now discuss separately each of the six points for the retention 
              of the custom of circumcision which Philo emphasizes. 
          <P><B>Philo: point I.<BR>
            </B>The first point of the explanation, as well as the others, does 
                not concern itself with the discovery of the reason, but relates rather 
                the sanitary consequences of the operation, and thus treats of the uses 
                resulting from it. This conception, which according to Trusen (p. 118) 
                contradicts the spirit of the Bible, since such a cause is not mentioned 
                there (1), is today the most wide spread and is especially popular among 
                physicians. Collin (p. 9) maintains the usefullness of circumcision 
                consist in:<BR>
            a) Prevention of paraphimosis and phimosis.<BR>
            b) Prevention of gonorrhoea of the glans. <BR>
            c) The glans, because of its early denudation, loses its too great sensitivity, 
            through which latter pollution and onanism easily arise. This sensitivity 
            is also often conditioned by an irritated condition of the smegma, which 
            involuntarily necessitates friction. <BR>
            d) Lesser susceptibility to syphilis. What part morality plays here 
            is uncertain. <BR>
            e) The circumcised man<FONT SIZE="3"> never runs the risk of bleeding 
                  as a result of the rupture of the ligament of the foreskin, which often 
                  happens during coitus. </FONT><BR>
            f) Diseases of the glans, etc. are easier to recognize and to treat. 
          <P><FONT SIZE="2">(1) Trusen writes, "Also circumcision, if it owed its 
                  origin to this cause would certainly have disappeared long ago among 
                  the Jews, who in later times were dispersed throughout all climates 
                  of the earth, through the observation that other peoples, who did not 
                  practice it, were not exposed to greater dangers of local diseases of 
                  the foreskin: for such random and always only sporadic and transient 
                  ailments of the foreskin, such as Gonorreah, phimosis and paraphimosis, 
                  as well as the rupture of the ligament do not demand such a generally 
                  practiced preventative measure<FONT SIZE="2">, which, moreover could 
                    be justified only for that tropical climate and is by no means without

          <P>cision for non-Jewish also, both in Europe and America (Remondino).          </P>
          <P>Sampoerno has recently shown that at least carcinoma of the penis cannot 
            be prevented by circumcision. Among 78 carcinomes of Javanese men seven 
            cancers of the penis were determined. Sampoerno says, "The view that 
            circumcision is a protection against carcinoma of the penis is untenable, 
            since the Javanese, like the Jews, regularly perform circumcision as 
            a rite". Bloch (p. 421) substantiates the effect of circumcision on 
            the resistance or even immunity of the penis to venereal diseases as 
            follows: "If the foreskin has been removed by circumcision, then secretion 
            ceases and the mucous membrane of the glans becomes a tough skin, less 
            accessible to irritations and agents of infections. There is no doubt 
            that circumcision is, to a certain extent, a protection against syphilitic 
            infection, but it does not, however, prevent gonorrhoea". 
          <P>From this point of view, and not unjustly, Rosenzweig calls it, "a 
              wise, sanitary-police measure". 
          <P>But one must have a pretty poor knowledge of the mentality of primitive 
                man, to think seriously for one moment that hygienic motives moved him 
                to introduce and make obligatory a general preventive measure. There 
                can be no doubt that even in the dark beginnings of time, surgical interventions 
                were carried out on the foreskin on medical grounds, then it is certain 
                even in those times, that congenital phimosis(1) occurred manifesting 
                in the manner, that physiologically, the inner blade of the foreskin 
                did not release from the glans or the opening of the foreskin was so 
                narrow, that the prepuce could never be retracted behind the glans. 
                Additionally acquired phimosis and phimosis of old-age must have received 
          operative removal         </TD></TR></TABLE>

          <P> in those days, as in today`s healing practice. According to Schepelmann 
            a longitudinal cut (incisio) is often sufficient, resulting in an "apron 
            formation"; in the case of infants sometimes all that is necessary is 
            simply "manual extension". 
          <P><FONT SIZE="2">(1 )Busch has given us a detailed description of phimosis 
              and its removal by operation. He maintains that, "Since among the Orientals 
              phimosis is almost a national characteristic, Moses made circumcision 
              a religious prescription and Mohammed also retained this prescription 
              for the professors of Islam." </FONT> 
          <P>I would even go as far as to assumethat the first circumcision 
                on Earth took place out of purely medical grounds, and it is a moot 
                point whether this answer first dawned on Stoneage man or the Egyptians 
                (as Ebers would have it). However, it contradicts the primitive way 
                of thinking to anchor this occasional operation in the cultural 
                practice. I refer, among others, to Eylmann. 
          <P>Eylmann (pp. 119-120) discusses first the hygienic uses of circumcision: 
            "In respect to circumcision it is usually not difficult to find an answer. 
                  As among peoples of other parts of the world, the frequent inflammation 
                  of the inner membrane of the foreskin and the glans <I>(balanoposthitis)</I> 
            is said to have been the reason among the aborigines of Australia for 
            removing the foreskin, in order thus to prevent the collection of the 
            sebaceous secretion. For this secretion, when it decomposes, easily 
            becomes so irritating to the mucous membranes that they become inflamed. 
            This explanation does not satisfy me. The inflammation appears most 
            frequently the first few years(2) after the beginning of sexual maturity, 
            but by no means often; and it causes severe pains only when the foreskin 
            is so narrow that the pus cannot find its way out. Under certain conditions, 
            however, it must be mentioned, it leads to a severe swelling of the 
            foreskin (inflamed phimosis and paraphimosis). But as a result of frequent 
            coition the foreskin is materially enlarged, so that it may be pulled

          <P>ceptional for it to cover the glans. The time during which its presence 
              causes any disadvantage worth mentioning, if I may so put it, is accordingly 
              very short. Cases of the sort where the opening is so small, that making 
              love causes pain, and even urinating is not easy occur so seldomly that 
            our discussion does not need to take them into consideration.</P>
          <P>"These are the reasons why I answer no to the question: Is it probable 
            that a primitive people, like the Australians, who are much less sensitive 
            to bodily pain than we are, were prompted to introduce, because of relatively 
            trivial, and not especially frequently occurring pains, a custom through 
            which in the end, more pain and discomfort were caused than by the original 
            malady? 
          <P>"In my opinion this mutilation of the penis is a kind of token of membership 
              in the society of men and the pain caused by its performance serves, 
              as many other tortures before the declaration of manhood, to make the 
              youths blind tools of the elders by intimidation. That this token was 
              not established in any other place should not surprise us since, indeed, 
              the masculine and feminine genitalia enjoy a greater measure of attention 
              than most other parts of the body among all peoples. Moreover, many 
              a person, be he member of a civilized or primitive people, must have 
              come to the conclusion that the foreskin was a superfluous creation 
              for the adult when he saw that it always surrounded the glans in children, 
              but in men often left it entirely bare, and that it then had the appearance 
              of being shrunken and in the process of disappearing. In addition there 
              is the fact that the sexual organ stands in a certain relation to the 
              attainment of manhood, for through it the youth receives the qualification 
              for marriage. 
          <P>"I have based what I have said above on the assumption that the custom 
                of removing the foreskin has arisen in the land with no outside influence. 
                Naturally it is not impossible that strangers introduced it or that 
                the ancestors of the Australian natives had already adopted it from 
                other peoples before they migrated to the fifth continent. But even 
                in such cases its origin would not be drastically different from that 
                which has been assumed; for among many primitive peoples initiations 
                of young men take place which in many respects are very similar to those 
                of the Australians". . .

                  Egyptians were exceptionally well fitted to invent such a wholesome 
                  measure as that of circumcision." (!) </FONT> 
          <P><FONT SIZE="2">(2) The correctness of this statement is still to be 
                    proved. An inflammation appears rather, in case there is no phimosis, 
                    only in children who have not yet denuded their glans , I have observed 
                    only one ease of paraphimosis in Central Africa: the patient was at 
                    most five years old. This was among the Margoli; a mother showed us 
                    her whimpering child, whose bared Penis had a very inflamed glans with 
                    the foreskin drawn back. (B.) </FONT> 
          <P>Christ also is said to have been convinced of the medicinal-hygienic 
                      purpose of circumcision, as concluded by interpreters from the following 
                      passage: "If a man may receive the circumcision on the Sabbath in order 
                      that the law of Moses be not broken, wherefore are ye wroth with me 
                      that I have made a man whole on the Sabbath"? Here Christ contrasts 
                      the healing of the whole body with circumcision; circumcision - it is 
                      argued - according to the view of Christ is to heal only a single member, 
                      the penis. (Salomon, pp. 22-23.) 
          <P>Josephus Flavius tells of the fatal consequences of surgical treatment 
                        of the inflamed member in the case of the Egyptian Apian as a result 
                        of gonorrhoea of the glans and infection: "Therefore Apion seems to 
                        me to have justly suffered a fitting punishment for deriding the laws 
                        of his country, for necessity had forced him to be circumcised since 
                        a swelling arose on his genital (his glans), and since the circumcision 
                        was unsuccessful, but rather putrescence set in, he died amid terrible 
                        pains." (Salomon, p. 23.)

              and still were introduced originally for medicinal reasons! And so when 
              Sudhoff today makes the introduction of circumcision dependent upon 
              hygienic reasons, whether syphilis was indigenous in the old world or 
              whether it was introduced from America: in the first case sees it in 
              a causal connection, and in the second, if syphilis was imported from 
              America, discards it; this whole manner of reasoning shows what little 
              regard was shown for the prelogical thinking of primitive man . . . 
              and with what seriousness this hypothesis of prophylactic expediency 
            is to be taken! </P>
          <P><FONT SIZE="2">(1)This argumentation seems to be forced. Circumcision 
            and healing do not at all have to be taken as antitheses here. Circumcision

            the Jews sick children may not be circumcised at all. The passage in

            be practised on the Sabbath, which affects only a part of the body, 
            how much more rather ought the healing of the whole body to be allowed 
            on the Sabbath?</FONT> 
          <P><FONT SIZE="2"><A NAME="sudhoff"></A></FONT>Sudhoff writes: "That the 
              circumcision of the Jews was taken over from the Egyptians has been 
              established today beyond doubt; likewise, that its origin for both nations 
              was the interior of Africa. Naturally, that would not deprive it of 
              its objective significance, as little as it could be denied of any other 
              custom that had its roots in a totally different order of ideas, therefore, 
              its influence in the hygienic sphere can be denied, because its subjective 
              hygienic imprint has worn off. But the hygienic significance of the 
              circumcision of man in antiquity becomes nil as soon as the non-existence 
              of syphilis in the old world before Columbus, which is generally accepted

              to be a hygienic measure. That the Jews did not adopt this Egyptian 
              temple custom is easily explained by the fact that at that time woman 
              played no part in the temple cult; indeed, she was not even allowed 
              to enter the temple: but it is still a question whether there was a 
              period in the history of the people of Israel when only the priestly 
              tribe was circumcised, or whether the circumcision of the whole nation

            </B>This coincides with the first insofar as it likewise refers to hygienic 
                  treatment, that of keeping the glans clean. It is therefore only a question 
                  of a detail: that of the possibility of the decomposition of the smegma. 
                  The smegma, previously considered to be a glandular secretion, but now 
                  shown by Stickler to consist of sloughed off fatty epithelial cells, 
                  may easily cause inflammation since it harbors a plentiful fauna of 
                  microbes - 25 varieties have already been demonstrated (Eberth) - for 
                  which it furnishes a suitable medium. From this there arises in warm 
                  countries, "especially in the sun, a pathological secretion of a fatty, 
                  noisome substance on the genitalia which is capable of irritating them 
                  and causing eruptions and morbid emanations from them". (Terquem, p. 
                  6.) 
          <P>It is possible also as a result of the hardening of collected smegmatic, 
                    epithelial cells in the pocket of the prepuce, for stones of the foreskin 
                    to be formed, <I>cacluli praeputiales,</I> which are not possible if 
                    the glans is kept clean through circumcision. 
          <P>As in the rejection of the explanation of the first point, the hygienic 
                      reason for the idea of circumcision in this second must also be rejected, 
                      in spite of the obvious advantages given as arguments (Eylmann, Sudhoff). 
                      I quote Risa as a typical advocate of the hygienic conception of the 
                      fundamental idea behind circumcision. 
          <P>"The presence of the prepuce does not allow the member to be kept thoroughly 
                        clean. The consequences of this uncleanliness, which manifest themselves 
                        especially in warm climates, are well known in their usual form as balanitis 
                        and balanoposthitis together with the resultant conditions. These are 
                        not only local pathological disturbances like inflamed phimosis as such,

              the bladder and kidneys, etc., but especially do they affect the physical 
              as well as the social spheres: the irritation which is caused by the 
              inflammation of the distal part of the penis leads to erection and release 
              through ejaculation, to enuresis, to onanism and pederasty with their 
            psycho-pathological reactions, and finally to moral crimes". </P>
          <P>A wise Moslem writer says: "It is exactly these fundamental effects 
            and their influence upon men that the Moslem lawgivers take into consideration 
            in establishing the strict performance of circumcision". 
          <P>These are the fearful consequences of the presence of the prepuce of 
              the state of uncircumcision as they have been described for us by the 
              Turkish physician Nuri Bey (Risa, p. 586) in his purposeful exaggeration. 
              First involuntary erection, then pederasty, and finally moral crimes! 
              That's quite Dantesque! What a picture we must get of the morals of 
              the uncircumcised with such perspective! Just think of the uncircumcised 
              African tribes, situated like dispersed islands amid the surrounding 
              circumcised, or of us Europeans. We hear further that, "the pain of 
              stretching and rupturing the ligament during coitus diminishes the sexual 
              pleasure and hinders its fulfillment. Of greater importance is the influence 
              on the woman. Among the circumcised certain changes take place in the 
              skin of the glans, especially in the corpuscles of Kraus, which lessen 
              the sensitivity of the glans; but when the glans is covered by the prepuce 
              it is much more sensitive, even when it is not stimulated to excess 
              by inflammation, as has been mentioned above, and thus during coitus 
              ejaculation in the uncircumcised results much sooner, often before sexual 
              feeling in the woman has reached its climax. Even if it is certain that 
              this is not absolutely necessary for the inception of gravidity, still 
              it certainly favors it and especially makes the woman more desirous 
              of repetition, thereby increasing the possibility of success. The duration 
              of coitus and consequently sexual feeling in the woman is thus increased 
              among those who are circumcised. It is well known that among certain 
              negro tribes the women demand circumcision of the men for this very 
              reason and give themselves only to men who are circumcised" (1). 
          <P><FONT SIZE="2">1) Even if this reason (which 1 do not know of) is true, 
                the refusal of women to give themselves to men who are not circumcised 
                is based on quite different motives than Risa (p. 588) gives. The uncircumcised 
                belongs to another tribe and prohibitions or another adopted custom 
                would already be sufficient to call forth in the negress the aversion 
                emphasized by Risa. (B.) </FONT> 
          <P>A pious Musselman told Risa: "The reduction of sexual pleasure is just 
                  what circumcision aims at. Too great sexual excitement puts man on an 
                  equal plane with the lower animals, impels him to wicked moral aberrations 
                  and tragic crime. On the other hand, the complete abolition of sexual 
                  feeling would make men non-organic beings. In all things moderation 
                  is best. We men enjoy coitus just enough". 
          <P>"The other objections as well which have been made against circumcision, 
                    the outbreak of metritis as a result of lengthy coitus, neuralgia, localized 
                    on the uncovered glans, painful erections as a result of the scar, cicatrized 
                    paraphimosis, easy susceptibility to chancre , etc. are weak, since 
                    they simply do not apply if the circumcision is performed <I>lege artis.</I> 
            And also the objection that deficient sensitivity of the glans leads 
            to pederasty falls down when one considers that at least to an equal 
            extent the uncircumcised peoples around the Mediterranean are subject 
            to this vice." (2) 
          <P><FONT SIZE="2">2) Here Risa contradicts himself We learned earlier 
                      that uncircumcision led to pederasty; now it is admitted that the circumcised

          <P>presents here is really a motive: to give the penis (or its glans) 
              a plastic appearance similar to that of a model - in this case the heart. 
              That is, a mimetic motive. Even if the model chosen is to be sought 
              in a doctrinaire-ethical world of conception, in itself presupposing 
              a very high spiritual culture, one which could not possibly have coincided 
              in point of time with the introduction of the custom of circumcision, 
              still there is in the whole train of thought a very plausible argument 
              which we later find spontaneously expressed by other authors (Tessman, 
              Bryk). It was not the heart that was to be imitated, nor was it meant 
              to be, but rather the phallus (the erected penis). 
          <P><B>Philo: point IV. </B><BR>
            Philo designates that as <I>"summa necassaria causa"</I>: the solicitude 
                for fruitfulness and numerous offspring. Being circumcised Philo does 
                not know the function of the foreskin during copulation or he would 
                not maintain that among uncircumcised the semen was lost in the folds 
                of the foreskin. The conception that the circumcised are far more fruitful 
                than the uncircumcised is also to be found in many later authors. Wolfsteiner 
                has even devoted a whole disputation to this question; with Spencer 
                he maintains that <I>"gentem circumcisam ad sobolem procreandam magis 
                  esse idoneam quam christianam"</I> (p. 21), but the reason for this 
                he sees primarily in the fact that the Jews marry at an earlier age. 
          <P>Flatt already doubts the correctness of this fourth point: "that the 
                  custom of circumcision has been favored by the opinion (in itself, however, 
                  unfounded) of the wholesome influence of the same on the health of the 
                  body and especially on fruitfulness". (v. Autenrieth, p. 55.) 
          <P>If all circumcised people are more fruitful than the uncircumcised, 
                    which still remains to be proved, it does not at all follow, as points 
                    I and II have likewise clearly shown us, that circumcision owes its 
          origin to this useful         </TD></TR></TABLE>

          <P>effect. Rather the fruitfulness of the circumcised lies in their specialization 
              of the sexual technique and in the regulation of the sexual instinct: 
              the possibility of conception thereby becomes more probable. 
          <P>This was also seen by Dubois Reymond: therefore the Jews owe their 
                superiority over the Christians to the removal of the prepuce and to 
                their sensible regulation of the sexual life during and before marriage 
                . . ." and for that reason he demanded obligatory circumcision among 
                Christians. 
          <P>In this case again Philo concludes the motive for circumcision from 
                  its effect, its use. 
          <P><B>Philo: point V</B>. <BR>
            The removal of the foreskin removed the sinful passions at the same 
            time. 1 do not know that the circumcised are any less sensual than the 
            uncircumcised; the well known Turkish harem does not in any way impress 
            us by its abstinence. On the contrary, the sensual factor is emphasized 
            by circumcision; the sexual act is only refined. 
          <P>The famous Jewish physician, Maimonides, held similar views to those 
                      expressed by Philo in points IV. V, and VI. "The bridling of the sexual 
                      instinct which impels especially the peoples of warmer climates to perversion; 
                      moderation and chastity, these seem to have been main purposes of the 
                      commandment of circumcision."

          <P>Nossig appeals to Maimonides, who says the following in his glorification 
                          of Jewish morality: "I believe one of the reasons for circumcision was 
                          the diminution of sexual intercourse and the weakening of the sexual 
                          organs; its purpose was to restrict the activities of this organ and 
                          to leave it at rest as much as possible. The true purpose of circumcision 
                          was to give the sexual organ that kind of physical pain as not to impair 
                          its natural function or the potency of the individual, but to lessen 
          the power of         </TD></TR></TABLE>

          <P>passion and of too great desire. An organ that is bled after birth 
              and its covering removed, is undoubtedly weakened". (Maimonides, Moreh 
              Nebuchim, III Chap. XLIX.) 
          <P>Maimonides motivates his whole untenable argument with a quotation 
                from the Talmud, (Bereschith rabba, Sec. 80, f. 70, col. 3): "A (Jewish) 
                woman who has associated in love with one uncircumcised can leave him 
                only with difficulty (1)". "And this is in my opinion the most important 
                cause for circumcision". Thus Maimonides concludes his observations. 
          <P><FONT SIZE="2">1) Quite different factors are involved here; for often 
                  Aryan women, who have associated with men who are circumcised. cannot 
                  leave them. (B.)</FONT> 
          <P>Other physicians, like Fallopius, have also subscribed to this reasoning 
                    on the purpose of circumcision: "For this very reason circumcision has 
                    been prescribed by God, lest the people indulge overmuch in the pleasure 
                    of love, and religion, divided by these pleasures, be neglected". (Wolfsheimer, 
                    p. 28.) 
          <P>Consequently it was a universal conception that circumcision curbed 
                      sensuality, a conception that was later proved false. The ethical factor, 
                      which Moses, Philo and Maimonides conceived to be the original motive 
                      for circumcision as a result of the removal of their passions, is not 
                      at all denied as having been present, but it could only have caused 
                      it among highly specialized cultures, such as the Israelitic, but not 
                      among primitive peoples, who are absolutely dominated by the phallic 
                      demon, who invented circumcision and from whom the old Israelites adopted

          <P>which in the prelogical mode of reasoning of totems is part of its 
              transmissions. This ascetic feature is also present in the idea of consecration, 
              to a certain extent, as has been maintained by later mythologists. 
          <P>Of the Church Fathers, Sedulius (between 400 and 440 A. D.) gives a 
                similar explanation, saying that circumcision is necessary for pure 
                procreation and sexual reproduction. (Glasberg, p. 220.) 
          <P>Quite an original explanation has been suggested by von Autenrieth, 
                  who derives the origin of circumcision from the barbaric phallic custom 
                  of certain peoples who bring home the genitalia of killed or even living 
                  enemies as an infallible trophy of victory, but who, in order to avoid 
                  suspicion that these signs of victory might have been plundered from 
                  their own dead, have adopted this means of making certain. That is, 
                  a strategic sign of recognition, similar to the white band of the cap 
                  of the fictitious enemy during manoeuvres. 
          <P>The penis (as symbol of manliness) is more easily brought home than 
                    other extremities of the enemy, such as skull, scalp, arms, hands. Marie 
                    Bonaparte (pp, 25-26) has given full particulars on the diffusion of 
                    this ancient war custom, especially in East Africa. This custom of phallotomy 
                    has not yet been completely extirpated even among us in Europe. Kraus 
                    writes: "'Montenegrins are accustomed to castrate their prisoners during 
                    campaigns and carry their penises with them as amulets. Many a warrior 
                    has a whole string of such amulets. The bandit wars of Macedonia, which 
                    for years have been taxing Europe's diplomatic art to the utmost, would 
                    probably long have died out if the occasional victors ceased from the 
                    fatal custom of mutilating their captured enemies and thus causing innumerable 
                    campaigns of revenge. Sicilian myths also mention similar mutilations".

              with the practice of cutting away the genitalia of conquered enemies 
              in order thus to prove beyond doubt one's own prowess in battle." (Autenrieth, 
              p. 38.) It is worth while to contrast the opinion of Zaborowski: <BR>
            <I>"II n'y pas une preuve, en effet, ni dans l'histoire de l'Egypte, 
                ni dans les livres sacr&eacute;s des Juifs et des Chr&eacute;tiens, 
                qu'une liaison quelconque ait d,abord exist&eacute; entre la phallotomie 
            et la circoncision."</I> . 
          <P> That phallotomy was known in Egypt we learn from the tomb of Osymandrios, 
                on which, together with a great number of chopped-off hands, there are 
                also represented many severed, uncircumcised masculine organs. (Autenrieth.) 
                This custom was also not unknown to the Israelites. There is King Saul's 
                command that David bring him a hundred foreskins' of the Philistines, 
                which David promptly did. No one can deny that a certain connection 
                exists between primitive warfare and phallotomy, and, likewise between 
                circumcision and the warrior caste. But it is false reasoning to conclude 
                that there is therefore a causal nexus between phallotomy and circumcision. 
                The greatest ignominy that can be done to man is and always was, to 
                deprive him of his organ of procreation. Castration as punishment is 
                still customary today among many peoples (Czekanowski, Hartmann, Pelikan); 
                indeed, it is known to have been practiced by single individuals in 
                the civilized nations of Europe as an act of revenge. I mention only 
                the horrible case of post-war times in south Sweden where a girl, with 
                the help of her mother, castrated her fiance because he had broken his 
                promise to marry her. But she later married the man, though he was missing

          <P>Sadism may also impel a woman to castration.<BR>
            "Castration and mutilation by women of enemy soldiers on battle-fields 
                or by revolutionists after barricade battles are hardly to be conceived 
                of as murders purely for the pleasure of it. Sexual lust is hardly an 
                impelling motive, but rather political fanaticism. That it is the sexual 
                parts themselves of the dying enemy that are attacked is probably the 
                result of a vague feeling of revenge on the part of the depraved woman 
                against that very organ of the powerless man that usually causes so 
                much trouble among them; it may also be true that sexual emotions are 
                aroused and relieved by the performance of these sadistic acts". (Wullfen.) 
          <P>We shall return to phallotomy in connection with the suggested psycho-analytical 
                  explanation of circumcision. Since the age of manhood is also a prerequisite 
                  for eligibility for military service and, as a rule (or originally), 
                  only marriageable youths are circumcised, the concept of the state of 
                  being circumcised would seem to coincide with that of the warrior. And 
                  consequently, among many East African tribes, the young man, from the 
                  day of his circumcision on is called "<I>el moran</I>" or "<I>moreniu</I>" 
            (Nandi, Massai, Suk, Elkoyni, Kikuyu). But the "strategic sign," as 
                  Autenrieth calls circumcision, became devoid of meaning on the day when 
                  circumcised enemy opposed circumcised friend on the field of battle 
                  and the sign of differentiation ceased to exist. Fundamentally, circumcision, 
                  in the conception of Autenrieth, is only a special case of social differentiation. 
          <P>According to Herbert Spencer there is likewise a connection between 
                    circumcision and strategy as a "sign of submission, in order to abolish 
                    the death penalty of conquered warriors". (Hastings, p. 666.)

          <P>stitute for sacrifice. Trusen summarizes this interpretation of the 
              custom of circumcision as follows: "Meiners, Boettiger and Vatke agree 
              in this: that circumcision is to be considered a survival of ancient 
              human sacrifice, the consecration of a part of the body instead of all 
              of it. 
          <P>"This unnatural principle was assigned to the highest nocturnal star, 
                Saturn, just as the quickening creative power was attributed to the 
                sun god. Man wanted to consecrate himself to God to be sure of his protection. 
                The completest form of consecration was complete sacrifice. But in order 
                not to have to perform this, the noblest part of the body, the organ 
                of procreation was offered up, which was especially holy to the creative 
                power of Nature. The facility with which one could thus consecrate himself 
                to God in time disseminated circumcision throughout whole cities and 
                peoples. Moses did not circumcise his own son, who had to be coerced 
                into circumcision by Jehovah, but at the time of David it was already 
                a general custom, as may be gathered from the hundred foreskins of the 
                Philistines. It is significant that even today a large taper must be 
                burning during the circumcision and the severed foreskin is not always 
                buried in dust or sand but among many congregations is also burnt, indicating 
                sacrifice. Circumcision was performed also on that day on which the 
                first-born were to be offered up, namely, the eight day. This day was 
                chosen only in order that the circumcision might be brought into the 
                closest connection with the sacrifice of the child. It is only through 
                circumcision that life, which belongs to Jehovah, is represented to 
                the boy. At the conclusion of the ceremony the rabbi dips his finger 
                into a goblet of wine, puts it into the mouth of the child and says, 
            "God has spoken unto thee: live!" He also sucks the blood out of the 
                wound and it is used for washing: a survival of priests' besmearing 
                themselves with the blood of sacrifice; the first being also a survival 
          of reconciliation with God.         </TD></TR></TABLE>

          <P>In order to make it less obnoxious, the water into which it trickels 
              is boiled with narcotic ingredients. In rabbinical writings, as well, 
              circumcision is very clearly conceived of as being a substitute for 
              a real sacrifice and the same effect is ascribed to the blood of circumcision 
              as to the blood of sacrifice. The covenant of circumcision is observed 
              equally with all sacrifices. Abraham lays all the foreskins of his household 
              in a heap, the odor of the decaying skins mounted like the odor of spice, 
              like incense on the fire, to holy God. Modern rabbis also see in circumcision 
              an attempt to replace human sacrifice with milder adaptations. 
          <P>"We also are decidedly of the latter opinion, far from agreeing with 
                the views of those who profanely interpret the words of the Lord in 
                the Scriptures, sacred to us Christians, that circumcision is a purely 
                human invention for the furtherance of social purposes and that it has 
                only a physical benefit for the peoples of the Orient. We consider it 
                rather to be a highly ingenious-religious transformation of human sacrifice 
                that was generally customary up to Abraham's time, the consecration 
                of a part of the body instead of the whole of it. Born at Ur in Chaldea 
                about 2000 B.C., Abraham, already in the house of his father Terah, 
                always kept clear of the idolatry that prevailed there and remained 
                untainted by it, and in this aversion to idolatry and human sacrifice 
                so early and firmly rooted in him is to be found, it seems, the germ 
                of that divine inspiration which, purposing the abolition of human sacrifice, 
                was also to be a covenant to consecrate himself and his whole people 
                to the Eternal, and to prevent his race, now called consecrated, from 
                mingling with other peoples. Even if, when introducing circumcision 
                as an act of sacrifice, Abraham kept the idea of the abolition of human 
                sacrifice in mind, it is not surprising that he was ready later himself 
                to offer up his son Isaac according to a divine inspiration, since it 
          seemed necessary as a         </TD></TR></TABLE>

              his wavering people definite proof of self-sacrifice and to strengthen 
              it in the worship and will of Jehovah. But we find our view confirmed 
              all the more when we notice that the foundation of the whole Egyptian 
              religion, namely, fructifying nature, which was especially manifest 
              in the worship of Isis, was known to the Jews, and, though in another 
              form, was worshipped by them. The capitals of Egyptian monuments symbolize 
              in two ritual orders of pillars the foundation of the whole Egyptian 
              religion, namely, fructifying nature: the first order represents the 
              erect phallus, as the symbol of the power of procreation, the other 
              form, by its capital, represents the vulva, as the symbol of conception, 
              both with the glans and lotus calyx, by analogy with the human genitalia. 
              The rite of the Egyptian Isis cult demanded especially the veneration 
              of the then not indecent morion as the symbol of organic life, but also 
              contained the union of woman with the cunning serpent, and likewise, 
              as Moses' allegory of the temptation of Adam to partake of the forbidden 
              fruit may have passed into the Bible from here, it is not improbable 
              that Abraham earlier also, with respect to the Isis cult and out of 
              the very veneration of the symbol of all organic life, derived the circumcision 
              of his people as an act of sacrifice, in order to substitute for the 
              consecration of the whole body the consecration of its noblest part. 
              Among the Israelites circumcision was therefore universal since the 
              whole nation was to be priestly". (pp. 121-124: Trusen, J. P.) 
          <P>According to Ghillany "human sacrifice was a prevailing part of the 
                worship in the religion of the ancient Hebrews and the original god

          <P>The idea of human sacrifice was abrogated by circumcision. Nork also 
                expresses a similar view: "The Jehovah cult, or the Israelitic religion, 
                is differentiated from the idols mentioned (Molech) only in that it 
                sought to substitute for the veneration of the phallus, i e., the adoration 
                of the creator in the masculine organ, the commandment of circumcision". 
          <P>Meiners (p. 467) is more concrete, since he was able more easily to 
                  derive circumcision from an ancient custom of blood sacrifice: "New 
                  born children were wounded on all parts of the body in reconciliation 
                  with the gods, especially on the organs of procreation (because these 
                  were considered the tools of existence and the birth of children), most 
                  of all on the foreskin, because this could be cut and mutilated with 
                  the least danger." 
          <P>Later (p. 479) he says: "Among most peoples(1), the children were circumcised 
                    shortly after birth, among others, however, about the time, or shortly 
                    before the time, of puberty. As I have shown, the maturity and marriage 
                    of children were considered happy events, at which, as well as at their 
                    birth, the gods were to be propitiated". 
          <P><FONT SIZE="2">1) Quite a vague statement. (B.)</FONT> 
          <P>Bottger (p. 55, (2)) supports Meiner's view, but in addition deduces

                        is connected with the phallus". I could adduce still other authors who

          <P>logians, know well that circumcision of infants is a derivative of 
              the original circumcision of youths consequently all speculations on 
              the substitution idea of child sacrifice, at least in this form, as 
              defended by the mythologists quoted, fall to the ground. The idea of 
              sacrifice does not therefore have to be denied, but it had nothing to 
              do with the original custom of circumcision, however in time it may 
              have attained major significance and displaced the original sense of 
              the custom. 
          <P>But for America, where, apparently, circumcision was not introduced 
                from the outside, but arose independently, the sacrifice idea may be 
                considered the motive for circumcision, because there its relations 
                to its rites are quite different from those of the old world. 
          <P>Andree II, pp. 161-162: "The view that the abscission of the foreskin 
                  is a sacrifice for the gods, indeed, even a substitution for human sacrifice, 
                  has repeatedly been expressed, and seems, at least for America, to be 
                  not unfounded. The blood taken from any part of the body was smeared 
                  by the high priests of Yucatan and Nicaragua on the representations 
                  of the gods, exactly like the blood of human sacrifice with which the 
                  temple doors and statutes were smeared in Peru. In Yucatan and Nicaragua 
                  and down to the Oronoco, sometimes the tongue and sometimes the genitalia 
                  were thus circumcised; among the Totonagas the ears and genitalia; in 
                  Nicaragua the blood from the sexual organs was sprinkled on maize, which 
                  was then distributed and consumed amid great solemnities. Among the 
                  Aztecs an incision was simply made in the breast of the one-year old 
                  boy or girl at the chief festival of Huitzilopochtli, whereupon he (or 
                  she) became consecrated to the god". 
          <P>I would like to derive the blood rite, which is still to be perceived 
                    here and there in the circumcision ceremonies of the old world, from 
                    motives similar to those which Andree gives, but in many cases it arises

          <P>quite another world of ideas than the original conception of circumcision: 
              which it later became amalgamated with. Even among the Jews, in spite 
              of their well-known dread of blood, this blood rite is clearly preserved. 
              Thus Bergson relates (p. 103), and we heard from Trusen, <I>incredible 
                dictu</I>, of recent circumcision ceremonies in which the <I>mohel</I> 
            held the child over water, "in order that the holy blood might flow 
              into it, and those standing about washed their faces with the blood-water". 
              The water had been previously boiled with narcotic ingredients. In the 
              case of Jewish infants that are born "uncircumcised" the <I>mohel</I> 
            must at least "make one drop of blood drop, as a sign of the covenant". 
              Preuss (p. 283). 
          <P>While the second example of symbolic circumcision, which is made permanent 
                by a precept in the law, similar to the episode "Moses as bloody husband", 
                evidently shows that the blood rite, a survival of an ancient sacrificial 
                custom, in time displaced the phallic idea of circumcision among the 
                Jews as well. The first case of communally performed "blood baptism" 
            belongs to quite another chain of psychic phenomena, which manifests 
            itself here and there scattered among other tribes. Perhaps (?) the 
            exsuction of the infant's bleeding penis by the<I> mohel</I> also belongs 
                here, as well as the<I> mika</I> operation to be mentioned later. All 
                these blood ceremonies whereby the older men of the tribe become fraternized 
                with the young people <I>show a homo-erotic element</I>. 
          <P>On the mika operation Karsch writes (p. 68): "Another even more important 
                  adaptation,(relating to mutual masturbation), observed almost exclusively 
                  among the Australian negroes, and characteristic of certain groups of 
                  tribes, stands in closest connection to the homosexual life of these 
                  peoples and even seems to have actual educative effect, that of subincision 
                  (mutilation) of the penis. Usually it is undertaken only after circumcision.

          <P>shows a history worthy of consideration in more than one respect". 
          <P>I quote another example after Reik and the inference drawn from it, 
                which, however, will be bound up with the explanation suggested by psychoanalysis 
                to be given later, and without which it cannot be understood. 'Among 
                the Mara and Anula tribes, after the circumcision, some blood from the 
                wound is allowed to drip onto the men whom the one operated lies upon 
                - in order to affect an especially fervent friendship. Among the Urabunas 
                the foreskin and circumcision knife are handed over to the eldest brother 
                of the circumcised, who touches with the foreskin the stomach of every 
                nuthi (a man who stands in the same relationship to the circumcised 
                as his eldest brother).(I)

                        fear of requital, introduced castration or circumcision and incision

                        perform a common act that can be based only on the same psychic phenomena: 
            "There is in it a recognition of the same desires that once animated

          <P>hood impulses and an emotional identification with the young people". 
              (Reik, pp. 108-109.)
          <P>Reik (p. 119) as a result of his researches on the libidinous proceedings 
                after the primary scene in the brotherhood clan, comes to the following 
                conclusion: "It was actually a case of the failure of heterosexual libidinorealization: 
                this was caused especially by the plurality of brothers and the sexual 
                rivalry resulting therefrom. The excitement aroused by the common, but 
                denied, object of the libido, the mother, had to be bestowed upon some 
                other object; it was transposed to the masculine object and thus, from 
                another quarter, the tender (homosexual) feelings of the brothers to 
                one another strengthened". 
          <P>According to other authors, circumcision has another sense: the shedding 
                  of blood had a prophylactic effect against caco-demons and was thus 
                  an act of exorcism. This is the opinion of Spencer (p. 40): "It is not 
                  rash to conjecture that circumcision had a prophylactic indication and 
                  had the power by the grace of God of warding off injury by cacodemons 
                  from all persons fortified with that sign". Strabo has already expressed 
                  a similar opinion. 
          <P> It is expressed much more distinctly in Baronias (Wintzler (p. 6)): 
            "Jesus was circumcised on the eighth day and the name Jesus given him 
                    at the circumcision, but by the shedding of blood that had resulted 
                    from the circumcision he destroyed the work of the devil, among which 
                    he especially counts the shameful and devilish customs of the heathens 
                    which they practice particularly on the first of January".1) 
          <P><FONT SIZE="2">1) The first of January is still today celebrated by 
                      the Catholic Church as the day of the circumcision of Christ, "Circumcisio

          <P>Schrieke supports the view that circumcision is one of the many acts 
                        of ritual whereby primitive man seeks to neutralize the dangerous powers 
                        that appear at the beginning of puberty (p. 398).

          <P>mon among the Jews and Christians, circumcision is conceived of as 
            "a prevention of the phallic cult". The same view was expressed by Saint 
              Thomas. Circumcision was introduced to ridicule the phallic cult as 
              well as the mysteries of Venus, to bring them into disrepute among the 
              Israelites, since by circumcision the very part so highly adored by 
              the other nations was changed and thus depreciated. 
          <P>Among negroes also, according to Reade, circumcision has arisen out 
                of the phallic cult as a phallic sacrifice. Considering the great part 
                that the phallus occupies in fetish religion, especially among the West 
                Africans, it is easily comprehensible, as Reade proves, in a land where 
                the men are seldom impotent, the women seldom unfruitful. (Karsch, p. 
                125.) 
          <P>In the discussion of the phallic cult, to which we shall later return, 
                  we shall see that circumcision is actually in the service of this cult, 
                  and is not at all meant to prevent it. Benzinger also (p. 120) takes 
                  this stand. Moreover, Benzinger makes a valuable contribution in thus 
                  linking up circumcision with the idea of sacrifice: "In solemnization 
                  of the Sabbath and circumcision the Jews sought a substitute for sacrifice, 
                  which they lacked, for they were not bound up with the temple. Thus 
                  circumcision became the chief symbol of the Jewish religious community". 
            "The symbolism is also very transparent, it is an act of purification 
                  (in the cultic sense), the foreskin being the substance of uncleanliness". 
          <P>Rietzenstein thus psychologically differentiates human sacrifice and 
                    circumcision: "Both are based on the ancient double development of the 
                    concept of sacrifice, proved to be characteristic of most peoples: the 
                    object of sacrifice is either annihilated or placed in the service of 
                    the god. Circumcision is delivery to a god: by it one becomes <I>web</I>, 
          "pure". ("The Egyptian priest is called <I>we</I>b,         </TD></TR></TABLE>

          <P>the pure one".) "It is ordination into the priesthood". (Reitzenstein, 
            11, p. 9.) 
          <P>If one epitomizes all the arguments in favor of the idea of human sacrifice, 
              one must admit that with the exception of America the suggested explanation 
              that derives the original motive for circumcision from the development 
              of the concept of sacrifice does not hold water. The motive for circumcision 
              cannot be brought into a causal connection with the sacrifice of the 
              first-born for the simple reason that the circumcision of infants is 
              a very late acquisition of all peoples. But a subsequent transmission 
              of the idea of sacrifice to the previously present circumcision does 
              seem very probable; many blood rites certainly speak for it, e.g. the 
              symbolical circumcision of Jewish infants that are born "circumcised", 
              as well as the concluding words of the <I>mohel's</I> blessing already 
              quoted, which actually identifies the act with the sacrifice of Isaac. 
              But that the sacrifice itself is not primary among the Jews may easily 
              be seen from the fact that the main emphasis is placed on the second 
              act of circumcision, the periah: a Jew who has not been subjected to 
              the periah is not considered circumcised. The idea of sacrifice would 
              be satisfied by the first act, the cut, as is shown by the exceptional 
              case of children who are born "uncircumcised" being received into the 
              covenant. 
          <P>Many blood rites seem to have a homo-erotic origin. In the discussion 
                of the initiation of boys I shall return to the social blood sacrifice, 
                which Le Roy considers circumcision to be. 
          <P>Psychoanalysis ties up directly with the explanations that see in circumcision 
                  a consecration or substitute for human sacrifice. It must be admitted 
                  that its discipline is the only one in all the study of circumcision 
                  that has at least evaluated all the factors with which mythology and 
                  ethnology have supplied us, and observed them methodically. All parallel 
        phenomena in the initiation of boys         </TD></TR></TABLE>

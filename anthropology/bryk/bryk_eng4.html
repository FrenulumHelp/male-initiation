        <P><FONT SIZE="2">Experts have been unable to understand the origin of the practice of routine 
          male circumcision. Most of the literature shows no awareness 
          of phimosis - its frequency - or the sexual and erectile problems which can be cured by circumcision. If routine circumcision 
          had been introduced for this most obvious reason of eliminating difficult 
          foreskins; then the importance of an alternative modern method, suitable to our culture's attitudes in this day and age, would be clear. </FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

        <P>p. 150 
        <P>Freud (pp. 131 ff.) has adopted the Darwinian picture of the primitive 
          horde, according to which the strongest man drove off his rivals in 
          order himself to retain complete mastery of his harem, and has sketched 
          the primeval scene which I quote literally: "One day the expelled brothers 
          (sons) got together, slew their father and consumed him and put an end 
          to the paternal horde. In union they dared and brought about what would 
          have been impossible for the individual. Perhaps some cultural advance, 
          the manipulation of a new weapon, gave them the feeling of superiority. 
          To have consumed the slain man as well is natural for the cannibal. 
          The brutal, primitive father was certainly the envied and feared model 
          of every one of the brothers. Now, by means of the act of eating him, 
          they completed their identification with him, they assimilated a part 
          of his strength. The totemmeal is perhaps the first festival of mankind, 
          the repetition and memorial of this notable, criminal deed, from which 
          so much took its inception- social organization, moral restrictions 
          and religion". According to Freud, then, mutually contradictory emotions 
          toward the father would have arisen among the patricides, which psychoanalysis 
          terms the ambivalence of the father-complex. They hated their father, 
          who, on the basis of his strength, had expelled them, but at the same 
          time they loved and admired him. After they had removed him and thus 
          appeased their hatred and accomplished their desire for identification 
          with him, the suppressed, tender emotions must have arisen. This took 
          place in the form of remorse, a consciousness of guilt arose, which 
          coincided with the feeling of remorse that was already present. What 
          the dead man had formerly prevented by his existence they now forbade 
          themselves out of the psychic situation of "subsequent obedience". 
        <P><FONT SIZE="2">1) The origin of consciousness of guilt can be explained 
          only out of the conflict of one's own instinctive actions and the suppressive 
          prohibitions of an existing social community. (B.) </FONT>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

        <P>They retrieved their deed by prohibiting the killing of the substitute 
          for the father, the totem, and renounced the fruits of their bloody 
          victory by abandoning the women who had now become free. Out of the 
          consciousness of guilt of the son they created the two fundamental taboos 
          of totemism, which, for that very reason, necessarily coincided with 
          the two suppressed desires of the Oedipus-complex. Whoever acted contrary 
          to them became guilty of the only two crimes that concern primitive 
          society. (Zeller, p. 119.) 
        <P>The incestuous desires slumbering in the child upon awakening not only 
          threaten the father, but the whole social community. These desires now 
          had to be suppressed in an effective manner. Circumcision would be one 
          of these conductors of the incest-instinct. It satisfies -according 
          to psychoanalysis- the inimical impulses of the father who is afraid 
          of his growing son, particularly because the latter wishes to rob him 
          of his wife (2) . The boy must be punished: in this sense circumcision 
          is castration, it is its equivalent, its symbol. By means of castration 
          sexual intercourse, especially incest, is to be prevented. But circumcision 
          is also a symbol of death. The many rites and ceremonies of the monster 
          or spirit who kills and devours the not yet initiated and consecrated, 
          with which their totem-animal, their ancestor, must really be identified, 
          all point to this. It is a matter of requital, because primevally the 
          sons have killed their father and now fear a recurrence. The tortures 
          and torments are only an attendant phenomenon to the two main hostile 
          motives of the father: castration and death. We quote the founder of 
          this theory, Reik, who writes (pp. 89-91): "We have previously found 
          the simulation of killing bound 
        <P><FONT SIZE="2">2 This speculation overlooks the fact that in the meantime 
          the woman, the Mother of the son, has become at least twelve years older 
          (since the birth of her first son), and thus, considering the incestuous 
          bent of the father (which psychoanalysis does not consider) and his 
          polygynous instincts; lost all importance in this question.</FONT>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

        <P>up with the operation of circumcision: circumcision is not a commutation 
          of human sacrifice but rather killing and circumcision are two separate 
          actions, connected only by the unconscious emotional life, of which 
          the first represents punishment for the unconscious desire of killing 
          the father, the second, punishment for the desire of incest of the young 
          people in their 'most dangerous age.' If we took into consideration 
          the intimate connection of these factors that are fundamental to both, 
          we should not be surprised to find in the rites of resurrection as well 
          a reaction against the threat of castration, which circumcision represents 
          both genetically and symbolically. As a matter of fact, such is the 
          case. Let us recall those variations of the initiation ceremonies in 
          which it is assumed that spirits in the forest take away certain parts 
          of the body from the boys and give them new ones in exchange, e.g. better 
          intestines, lungs, etc. Let us further picture to ourselves that identification 
          with the totem-animal or the ancestral spirits confers the powers and 
          capabilities, indeed, even the bodily characteristics, of the totem. 
          It is not difficult to find in this identification that factor which 
          is an alleviation of the threat of castration, namely, the imaginative 
          desire of exchanging one's own little penis for the big one of his father. 
          Indeed, it can even be said that it is this imaginative desire that 
          is present in the consciousness of peoples in a more or less distorted 
          form as the only sense of circumcision. If natives are questioned as 
          to the purpose of circumcision, their answer coincides with the judgement 
          of authorities on the subject, anthropologists and ethnologists, saying 
          that it is an operation to facilitate sexual intercourse or to intensify 
          its pleasure. But the imaginative desire of the primitive given above, 
          of receiving the larger penis of the totem or father instead of that 
          amputated from one's self, by identification with the father, gives 
          us an exact ethno-psychological parallel to certain infantile reactions 
          to the         </TD></TR></TABLE>

        <P>threat of castration. That operation and disjunction of the organ at 
          the hands of spirits in primitive initiation rites is similar in every 
          respect to the imagination of little Hans, whose 'podel' and 'weewee-maker' 
          (penis, B.) an installator took away to bring him two larger copies 
          of those valuable parts of the body 'just like daddy's'. An unconscious 
          connection between the two rites is found in the fact that the states 
          of death and resurrection represent symbolically the relaxation and 
          erection of the penis". 
        <P>It is interesting to see how Reik logically connects circumcision among 
          the Jews with his psychoanalytic speculation and interprets it accordingly. 
          It was a valuable contribution that once and for all the holy custom 
          of the Israelites was declared to be simply a counterpart of the "barbaric" 
          rites of the puberty initiations of the savage. Moreover, in the "bar-mitzva" 
          of the masculine Israelites, which coincides with the confirmation of 
          Christians, the institution of initiation of boys is preserved to the 
          present day just as in leaving-examinations or any other declarations 
          of maturity. 
        <P>Reik (p. 122) follows this up: "The connection of the brith with circumcision 
          is just as little a matter of chance as the feast of the covenant in 
          which the followers of Jehovah identify themselves with him, and, also, 
          the fact of the giving of the laws -<I> brith</I> itself can mean law 
          - which is connected so intimately with the conclusion of the covenant 
          (Sinai) may be paralleled with the rites of puberty. The promise of 
          numerous offspring corresponds to the primitive license for sexual intercourse 
          just as that of the promised land, sexual-symbolically, presents the 
          prospect of a substitute for the beloved mother. The threats which Yahweh 
          utters in the case of a transgression of the covenant are fundamentally 
          the same as those which the Au-         </TD></TR></TABLE>

        <P>stralian negroes heap on the matured youths. The psychoanalysis of 
          the rites of puberty will permit seeing in the significant occurrences 
          of masculine initiations that are found today in the bush the modern 
          counterpart of the dispensation of Mt. Sinai". 
        <P>After circumcision, exactly as at the conclusion of those puberty initiations 
          that do not include circumcision at all, the boy is received into society 
          as a valuable citizen of equal rank, who from now on enjoys all the 
          rights previously denied him. Sexual intercourse, in particular, is 
          now granted to him freely: his identification card, his badge for marriage 
          is obvious enough. 
        <P>"Many Central Australian tribes believe that after initiation a boy 
          must have sexual intercourse or die. In Serange, one of the Molukka 
          Islands, the young man must have intercourse with young girls, no matter 
          which, directly after circumcision 'in order that the wound heal'. (Crawley) 
          That is continued until the wound has stopped bleeding. Among the Kikuyu 
          of West Africa (? B.) it is believed that the first cohabitation the 
          newly circumcised practice will lead either to their own or their partners' 
          death. They seek to escape this melancholy fate by the following means. 
          After the performance of the rites of puberty the men collect in groups 
          of fifteen to twenty, fall upon several old women in solitary places, 
          abuse them sexually and then kill them. The death of these old women 
          frees the youths of all danger." (1)

        <P> Reik (p. 99) is of the opinion, in connection with this, "that it 
          was only late that permission for sexual intercourse after circumcision 
          lifted the general ban and that this belongs to an advanced stage of 
          development. Originally this prohibition remained effectual in spite 
          of. the operation. Thus the young men of the Aranda and other tribes 
          of central Australia, in the 'good, old times,' had to wait for the 
          women promised them until the first grey hairs showed in their beards".         </TD></TR></TABLE>

        <P>Now <B>Zeller</B> has extended the explanation of the idea of circumcision 
          advanced by psychoanalysis on the basis of intensive studies of initiation 
          rites of boys in the literature pertaining to the subject and with consideration 
          of most of the other explanations suggested. We quote his conclusions 
          literally; but in order that they be not removed from their proper context, 
          we must first give a few descriptions of incision. 
        <P>Langsdorff relates the following on the circumcision of the Nuhakiwans: 
          "Circumcision or the slitting up and extension of the foreskin is a 
          general operation among the Nuhakiwans (South Sea Islanders) which is 
          not performed until rather late, usually when the boy has reached sexual 
          maturity. A small rod covered by a piece of cloth is inserted under 
          the foreskin, which is then ripped up with a sharp stone and the wound 
          rubbed in with the juice of a plant (pahpa). Although severe inflammation 
          sometimes results, it usually passes away in ten to twelve days. Anyone 
          may perform the operation except the father of the boy. The operator 
          is called <I>tahba</I>; he is retained in the house of the patient until 
          all inflammation is gone, where he is served with abundant pork, and 
          when leaving he receives a pig as remuneration. Cleanliness is apparently 
          intended at this operation". 
        <P>We find another report on incision in Kramer (pp. 61 f.): "Circumcision, 
          in this case not an actual 'cutting around', but a simple splitting 
          of the foreskin, that is, an incision into the upper edge, as is generally 
          customary in Indonesia, is performed in the following manner: spatula 
          is inserted under the foreskin and the latter severed by a blow with 
          some sharp object such as a shark's tooth, a shell, a bamboo knife, 
          and recently, of course, a steel knife. It is performed among the Samoan 
          youth similarly as among the Mohammedans, at the appearance of puberty, 
          always between the seventh and fifteenth         </TD></TR></TABLE>

        <P>year. Religious customs, as is the case among other peoples ... seem 
          never to have been connected with the operation in Samoa. It is performed 
          usually by one experienced in it. The leading motive for Samoa seems 
          to have been that of cleanliness for it is said that no Samoan girl 
          would sleep with one who was uncircumcised". 
        <P>While Kramer as a physician is inclined to accept the hygienic value 
          of the concept of cleanliness as the original reason for the introduction 
          of circumcision and to consider everything else, such as religious rites, 
          to be secondary, both of the Sarasins (p. 52 ff.) in view of the incision 
          which they found on the Celebes, are of a different opinion: "Smashing 
          out of the teeth (in boys only of the crown) is customary, the teeth 
          being partly sawed through first and then broken off. The boys themselves 
          choose the time. Since the operation is performed on all men and women, 
          it may originally have been a sacrifice of a part of the body in lieu 
          of the whole, as is suspected to be the case also with circumcision. 
          The latter operation is performed on all boys, a round rod being inserted 
          under the foreskin, down the whole length of which the prepuce is split, 
          but not removed; this is incision, not circumcision. The wound was shown 
          us, a very harmless incision but quite useful against possible phimosis".

          is also performed at the same time as this operation on the older boys, 
          but the eleven to thirteen year olds are only perforated. Nor are these 
          circumcised later. This surgical manipulation of the masculine organ, 
          which in addition is performed with an instrument indicating the totem, 
          a cassowary bone, can certainly not be termed 'a surgical act of preparation 
          for the sexual function of the man'. Since even after this manipulation

          a question here of the correction of nature, which Heinrich Ploss considers 
          to be the original reason for every circumcision. If this view were 
          to be accepted, the omission of circumcision in the case of the younger 
          boys would have to be explained, since only that could be a correction 
          of nature in the sense of Ploss. The reason for perforation must be 
          sought for elsewhere.

        <P>"The commonest form of manipulation of the penis is circumcision in 
          its literal sense. In addition it is the best known since the Jews also 
          perform it, The procedure is not the same, of course, among all peoples, 
          but the amputation of the foreskin is always present. (2) I may assume 
          the explanations suggested to be well known. I must first establish 
          certain facts: in our first part we have found no circumcision that 
          was not performed without special rites.(3) We cannot very well deny 
          the religious background of these rites. Even Ploss and Andree cannot 
          shut their eyes to these facts, but maintain that the religious rites 
          have nothing to do with the origin of circumcision, having been connected 
          with them only subsequently. The explanation they suggest presupposes 
          that observation and detached contemplation existed among savages before 
          religious usages, for the correction of nature as the origin of circumcision 
          demands this assumption. (4) Now it seems to me that the religious factor 
          is quite generally the primary one, and the other, if it is at all to 
          be considered, only secondary. We shall occupy ourselves very intensively 
          with these ceremonies, which will lead us to totemism almost every time.

        <P>tated foreskin. It is seldom thrown aside negligently. Usually it is 
          buried in a particular spot; this also includes burying it in an ant 
          hill, where the ants effect its complete annihilation. In this custom 
          the fear that some magician could cast a spell over the foreskin and 
          thereby cause its previous owner great harm, may have been decisive. 
          But the supernatural is indicated in the custom of entombing the foreskin 
          in a mountain cave together with bullroarers (spirit voices) as Frobenius 
          describes it of the Durru. A similar entombment is carried out by various 
          Australian tribes, according to Frazer; they place the foreskins in 
          totem-trees, totem-rocks and other totem-centers, which serve as the 
          abodes of the souls of the departed while they wait for rebirth. Among 
          the Hova the father of the boy must eat the foreskin with a banana, 
          or it is wrapped in a banana leaf and given to a calf to eat. 
        <P>"If circumcision were really only an act of preparation for procreation, 
          would there be any sense in treating the foreskin in this remarkable 
          manner? (1)

        <P>"Subincision is confined to Australia. That the explanation suggested 
          by Ploss and Andree cannot prevail here either need not be shown in 
          detail. We are acquainted with the view of Strehlow on this point and

        <P>"Let us first assume that the natives had introduced subincision in 
          order to prevent over-population. 
        <P> "It is clear to everyone that they could have arrived at the conclusion 
          that a splitting of the organ would lead to a diminution of births simply 
          and entirely by logical thinking. In such a case it was necessary that 
          they know, of course, the function of the seminal fluid. However, this

        <P>"Let us look about then for another possibility that could have led 
          to the mutilation of the penis. As we know, the young lad, in being 
          received into the circle of men, must be subjected to specific tortures, 
          many of which leave permanent disfigurations behind. Splitting the masculine 
          organ is one of these tortures. I doubt that the reader will contradict 
          me if I maintain that this highly painful operation could have had the 
          purpose merely of furnishing the lad with a permanent mark of distinction 
          and to make him an obedient member of the society by means of intense 
          bullying, or, if we prefer, 'to test his courage and staunchness'.(1) 
        <P><FONT SIZE="2">1) Qui tacet consentire videtur, therefore I do contradict

        <P>"Missionaries of Hermannsburg and Kitalpanina, asserted to me that 
          the boys of the stations were less guilty of moral transgression after 
          subincision than before it, even if, as 'young men', they remained unmarried 
          for years.(2) If the missionaries were not mistaken, one could draw 
          the conclusion from their observation that sexual excitability was reduced 
          as a result of this splitting of the penis. 
        <P><FONT SIZE="2">2) Again a false conclusion; a false reason is concluded 
          from the apparent effect. Through the official reception into the society 
          of men, every circumcised boy (in Africa as well) becomes more serious; 
          he casts off the clothes of his youth, the course of his life is now 
          regulated. (B.) </FONT> 
        <P>"Strehlow and Eylmann, therefore, agree in the main, but especially 
          when rejecting diminution of births as the cause of subincision. It 
          is an important point that the young men, after subincision, become 
          less prone to moral transgression, as Eylmann relates. Strehlow gives 
          this very point as the reason for subincision, namely, the restriction 
          of the sexual excesses of the youth. 
        <P>"The last kind of circumcision is partial testicular extirpation. I 
          need not waste any words on the reliability of the source. The significance

        <P>sion is obvious. It is castration, in spite of the fact that only one 
          testicle is excised. 
        <P>"Thus we arrive at the explanation of circumcision suggested by psychoanalysis 
          in its broad sense. We have already become acquainted with it, but on 
          account of its great importance we repeat it cursorily. Psychoanalysis 
          sees in circumcision an unconscious symbol of castration, designed to 
          prevent the young boy, tending toward incest with his mother, from carrying 
          out his unconscious desire. Circumcision (castration) is performed by 
          the men because they feel they are threatened by the unconscious desires 
          of the boys, directed toward their wives.(1) By this act, coitus, and 
          consequently incest, are made symbolically impossible and the hostile 
          feelings of the boy against his father become purposeless. As we have 
          seen, the symbol of castration is used for testicular extirpation. 
        <P><FONT SIZE="2">1) The circumcised youth, whether married or unmarried, 
          sets his desires especially upon unfamiliar women; cf. Bryk, Voodoo-Eros, 
          p. 112. (B.) </FONT> 
        <P>"In the case of subincision, the explanation, rejected however, by 
          Strehlow and Eylmann, that a diminishing in the number of births is 
          thus attained, needs only a slight change: that sexual intercourse in 
          general is thus prevented.(2) We have the symbol of castration, then, 
          here also. But this statement demands some support, with which Strehlow 
          himself furnishes us, in the reasons given him by the natives themselves 
          for circumcision and subincision. According to these, the boys, who 
          are entering their 'wild oats' years, must be brought under the dominion 
          of the old men by circumcision; they must be brought up in obedience. 
          The men resist the insubordination of the boys resulting from their 
          hostile emotions. If they did not practice circumcision, the young men 
          would 
        <P><FONT SIZE="2">2) Since subincision is performed on all men, then according 
          to Zeller the whole tribe would be symbolically prevented from practicing 
          sexual intercourse, which Zeller can hardly assume as being intended.

        <P>murder the members of their tribe and devour them.(1) Thus relates 
          the legend of the hawk-men. Translated into psychoanalysis, the interpretation 
          is as follows: if you men do not circumcise (castrate) the boys, they 
          will follow their hostile impulses, and kill and devour you, as the 
          sons did to their father in the primeval horde. 
        <P><FONT SIZE="2">1) All the other primitive peoples who are unacquainted 
          with circumcision or have rejected it seem to get along without circumcision. 
          (B.) </FONT> 
        <P>"In addition, circumcision is meant to put a brake to the excesses 
          of the boys, who are at a critical age. It is easily comprehensible 
          that during this time of sexual ripening, a desire for incest actually 
          exists, which is just what the men fear and seek to annul; this is shown 
          by the strong incestual instinct among the Australians, manifested by 
          their complicated marriage prohibitions. By castration a final barrier 
          would be put before it. But for reasons of procreation, it must remain 
          a symbol . (2) The two points elucidated here distinctly show that circumcision 
          is an act inimical to the boy. 
        <P><FONT SIZE="2">2) Castration must consequently be relinquished; the 
          symbol of a substitute is not very effective, the whole thing is a farce 
          which any incestuous person can easily see through.</FONT> 
        <P> "The two following points have their origin in affection for the boy, 
          for they say that circumcision prevents the prepuce growing together, 
          and that subincision is to make the boy supple. The ambivalence of the 
          emotions is made manifest here. 
        <P>"Point five <I><FONT SIZE="2">(? the next point RS)</FONT></I> gives 
          us in a few strokes a copy of the Freudian primeval horde. In the former 
          the father takes possession of all the females for his own use, in the 
          latter it is the old men who take all the girls and women for themselves, 
          giving the sons nothing for a long time, and finally only an old woman. 
          It is obvious that the old men, who have the power, will not let go 
          of a custom that grants them such privileges. On the other hand the 
          youths, who are thus deprived of marriage possibilities for a long time, 
          must harbor particularly hostile emotions         </TD></TR></TABLE>

        <P>toward the men who keep the women from them, emotions at least as strong 
          as their unsatisfied sexual instincts. Consequently the men are in greater 
          danger here than among other peoples where such limitations do not exist. 
          This is possibly the reason why we find two kinds of circumcision among 
          the Australians, circumcision proper and subincision, while the latter 
          is to be found nowhere else. 
        <P>"If one examines the results of circumcision, there is actually to 
          be found, as Eylmann reports, the effect desired by the fathers. Moral 
          transgressions, among which incest is probably included, are not so 
          common as formerly; a brake has been set to these instincts. Thus the 
          symbol of castration effects a limitation necessarily lying in the direction 
          of the sexual instinct. 
        <P>"It is obvious that among the Australians it was originally not at 
          all a matter of preparation for the sexual function. 
        <P>"Perforation also, which in older boys is bound up with circumcision, 
          can be proved to be a symbol of castration, since directly after the 
          operation even among those candidates who are already married, all sexual 
          intercourse is strictly forbidden for a certain time.(1) Here, then, 
          the effect which circumcision is to have as a symbol of castration is 
          produced artificially by a prohibition. It is this very prohibition 
          which distinctly shows what the fathers really want. The continence 
          imposed upon the boys during their initiation, or, as it could also 
          be termed, the enforced sexual impotence prevents them equally well 
          from committing incest as complete castration would. This prohibition 
          is confined temporarily to the initiation since it is not necessary 
          any more after it, when the boys have suppressed their infantile emotions 
          and become identified with the fathers. The moment of the sexual continence 
          imposed 
        <P><FONT SIZE="2">1) This prohibition is almost universal for all those 
          newly circumcised until their complete convalescence. (B.) </FONT>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

        <P>by the fathers is very important, since it occurs in most of the initiation 
          rites of boys.
        <P>"Let us now consider the other ... well-known explanations suggested. 
          First we, have the following group of researches: H. Ploss, R. Andree, 
          H. Schurtz, and L. Frobenius. All, with slight variations, subscribe 
          to the same view. We have already approached this opinion without psychoanalysis. 
          But psychoanalysis does not reject these explanations directly. If the 
          natives themselves declare that circumcision is to facilitate the act 
          of procreation, and perhaps intensify its pleasure as well, or that 
          it is performed for hygienic reasons, this motivation is not to be cast 
          aside without consideration. 
        <P>"If psychoanalysis admits the justification of this motivation, it 
          professes two opinions that appear incompatible, indeed, even directly 
          opposed to each other. But the contrast is easily neutralized by the 
          ambivalence of the emotions in the fathers. In most races, the hostile 
          emotions of the fathers have been relegated to the subconscious through 
          centuries of repression, and only the friendly emotions are now manifest. 
          Today the natives explain circumcision as a friendly and benevolent 
          act which is useful and salutary to the boys. 
        <P>"Thus Ploss and his followers base themselves, in their explanations, 
          only on the friendly side of this ambivalence, while psychoanalysis 
          takes both into consideration . . . Accordingly, both sides of this 
          ambivalence must still be verified today, and it is for this very reason 
          that it is impossible to advance an explanation that holds only to one 
          side. 
        <P>"We shall not spend too much time on the explanation suggested by Otto 
          Stoll. He sees in circumcision nothing more than one of the many kinds 
          of tortures to which boys are exposed during their initiation. The sexual 
          organ is simply another base for bloody mutilation . . . Stoll is quite 
          alone in this opinion".         </TD></TR></TABLE>

        <P>p. 164 
        <P>It is not possible to place all other tortures on the same plane with 
          circumcision. Let it be mentioned in passing that every one of the other 
          forms of torment is separately determined psychically. In regard to 
          several points Zeller agrees with the explanation suggested by B. Renz; 
          he establishes the religious standpoint of circumcision and thus occupies 
          the same ground. Zeller writes again: 'Then there follows the view that 
          the sexual factor is decisive for the act of circumcision; that it is 
          a case of the worship of sexuality or fruitfulness'. 
        <P>"Psychoanalysis does not at all reject such a conception, but does 
          maintain that it is not the only valid one; because the other side of 
          the emotional ambivalence must also be taken into consideration ... 
        <P>"As a result the following interesting fact is determined, that the 
          more the friendly side of the ambivalence of emotions becomes established, 
          the more the hostile side is suppressed into the unconscious and the 
          higher the nation is culturally. The case of Australia is important 
          as showing a state in which the friendly and hostile sides are still 
          in the balance, to a certain extent . . The idea of alliance, which 
          Renz gives as the reason for circumcision, is applicable rather to the 
          whole initiation, since all those initiated at the same time remain 
          allied for the rest of their lives. She says that circumcision plays 
          a part in this alliance in that it furnishes a sign of union. Although 
          blood brotherhood occurs, as we shall see, still it seems to me that 
          circumcision cannot be motivated in this way. The idea of alliance is 
          most marked in Jewish circumcision where it represents the covenant 
          with the One God. But one must beware of drawing general conclusions 
          from a circumcision that is more a survival of a former initiation ceremony, 
          and, moreover, is practiced by a people that is highly advanced culturally." 
        <P>Nor can Zeller allow circumcision as the original sign of the tribe. 
          For, since circumcision is so wide-spread, it         </TD></TR></TABLE>

        <P>would frequently happen that all the neighboring tribes would have 
          a similar sign. Zeller cannot subscribe to the opinion that circumcision 
          is a rebirth from the stomach of a spirit, represented by all kinds 
          of isolation huts, etc., .as Frazer and Renz contend, for the reason 
          that circumcision appears first and only then does isolation from the 
          external world follow. The other arguments advanced by Frazer in support 
          of his rebirth-theory were likewise criticized by Zeller. Instead of 
          a rebirth, he sees in everything a symbolic killing of the youth during 
          the act of circumcision. Zeller continues: 
        <P>"With this conception of circumcision as a symbol of killing I go further 
          than psychoanalysis. It sees in circumcision only a symbol of castration 
          and not a killing ... The treatment of the foreskin after circumcision, 
          as well as other ceremonies, must lead to the view that, besides the 
          point of castration, circumcision represents also a symbol of death. 
          It is likewise a sacrifice of the boy and accordingly belongs in the 
          same class with cutting of the hair, the tooth operation, surgical manipulation 
          of the lobe of the ear, the septum of the nose, etc.... Very few sources 
          mention anything about the treatment of the wound. Usually its healing 
          is left to nature; occasionally the relatives take measures to alleviate 
          or accelerate recovery. There is a purpose in this absence of treatment 
          of the wound, for primitive man is very well versed in cures for other 
          wounds. But if two sources tell us that the wound is not only not treated, 
          but actually afflicted with unbearable pains, that certainly looks like 
          purposed torture".(1) 
        <P> <FONT SIZE="2">(1) Zeller goes too far here. Whoever is acquainted 
          with the original preparation of foods among primitive people, which 
          consists or consisted mainly in poisonous plants, would seem justified, 
          by analogy, in concluding that the women who prepared the food wished 
          to poison their husbands. That these antiseptics have the effect of 
          poisons may very well point to the primitive state of therapeutics here, 
          but does not at all justify drawing the conclusion that Zeller does.

        <P>Zeller sums up his suggested psychoanalytical explanation as follows:

          years of puberty. In those cases where it is performed during the first 
          months or         </TD></TR></TABLE>

        <P>years of the boy's life, a secondary shift of the custom has taken 
          place. 
        <P>"Circumcision is a symbol of castration but at the same time also a 
          symbol of the killing and sacrifice of the whole person. 
        <P>"The tooth operations signify a sacrifice of the sexual organs and 
          in a broader sense a sacrifice of the whole person. They are substitutes 
          for circumcision. The cutting of the hair likewise represents a symbolic 
          sacrifice of the whole body. 
        <P>"Tatooing was originally a typical torment and hostile action of the 
          father toward his son. In the course of time it has developed into a 
          tribal sign and means of adornment.
        <P> "Tortures and torments likewise were originally hostile acts of the 
          fathers against the boys as a punishment for their unconscious incestuous 
          lusts and patricidal desires. But as a result of centuries of suppression 
          the hostile side of the emotional ambivalence of the fathers was thrown 
          more or less into the unconscious, so that today, in the main, it is 
          only the friendly side that consciously appears. It explains these tortures 
          as tests of courage and staunchness, serving to inure the boys against 
          hardships. Both explanations together possess validity, but one alone 
          does not. The rites of killing, in which category belong also, besides 
          the direct symbol of devouring, the indirect symbols of isolation, sleep. 
          silence, etc., are the requital unconsciously paid the sons by their 
          fathers for their murderous designs. Wherever the symbolic killing occurs 
          through a monster or spirit, the men identify themselves with them. 
        <P>"The spirit presiding over the initiation is in most cases a totem 
          in the form of a monster or some ancestral figure. It follows from this, 
          as also from other rites, that the religious factor was originally one 
          of the chief constituents of every initiation of boys.         </TD></TR></TABLE>

        <P>"Sacrifices and sacrificial meals usually affect totem animals. By 
          the transgression of the taboo against killing and eating the totem 
          animals, a very intimate relationship is thought to arise between the 
          already initiated and the novices. 
        <P>"Sexual precepts form a great part of the instructions received by 
          the youths. Especially incest is strictly forbidden. The reason for 
          this is to be found in the fear the men have of the boys' desires, the 
          satisfaction of which could become dangerous to them. 
        <P>"The instruction in the dance has as its purpose the bringing about 
          of an identification of the boys with the spirit of the initiation. 
        <P>"The reappearance of the boys out of isolation in the form of a rebirth 
          corresponds to the primitive view that the soul of one who is dead may 
          attain to life again only through the medium of a rebirth, by penetrating 
          into the body of the new-born individual. 
        <P>"The initiation of boys in its totality is a great process of suppression 
          forced upon the boys by the fathers, the accomplishment of which is 
          necessary for the preservation of the social structure".

          We have purposely taken up the subject of the initiations of boys and 
          the psychoanalytical speculations derived from them at as great length 
          as possible, since without them the problem of circumcision would have 
          been elucidated in a very one-sided manner. Circumcision is most intimately 
          bound up with the initiations of boys into manhood, and thus may not 
          be torn out of this, its historical connection. Today it constitutes 
          the chief factor of these initiations. But if, in spite of this, we 
          do not subscribe to the conception of the psychoanalytic school, it 
          is for the reason that we believe we can prove that circumcision arose 
          independently and not out of the         </TD></TR></TABLE>

        <P>initiation rites, rather as a consequence of them: that it did arise 
          out of purely physiological and psychological factors that dominate 
          primitive man. 
        <P>The latest explanation advanced by Preuss (II) applies only to individual 
          cases: "At the initiation rites, continued life in the beyond seems 
          to have been bound up with a long prosperous life on earth as a self-understood 
          consequence. During the time of the solemnities, the sexual element, 
          logically leading to death, was marked either during or before sexual 
          maturity. Circumcisions of the genitalia of any kind whatsoever, so 
          far as they occur among other peoples, do not necessarily embrace within 
          themselves any other idea than that of a badge and guarantee that coitus 
          may take place without the consequence of death". 
        <P>If a negro is asked why he circumcised himself, he usually gives no 
          answer because he does not know. In many cases the reason he gives is 
          an esthetic motive: (Bryk, I, p. 55), it is performed because it is 
          <I>maridati</I>, because it is beautiful: that is, in a broader sense, 
          because it has an erotic effect. Even if it is certain that this is 
          a discernment resulting from the custom of circumcision, this explanation 
          in itself is of a "magic" nature, because it confuses effect with cause. 
        <P> Ludolf (Lib. III, c. I) received a similar explanation from the Abyssinian 
          king Claudius: "Our circumcision, indeed, is performed to follow the 
          usage of the country, just like cutting into the face in Aethiopia and 
          Nubia and perforating the ear among the Indians. Moreover, what we do, 
          we do not do in observation of the Mosaic laws, but rather because of 
          a human custom". 
        <P>That is, circumcision is specifically put into a class with artificial 
          body decorations, ornamental scars or perforations of the ear, and it 
          is not practiced for religious reasons. Westermarck still conceives 
          it as being purely esthetic. "The mutilations, after the eye had become

        <P>customed to them, gradually ceased to be fascinating and their performance 
          continued simply as a result of the force of custom or for a religious 
          reason", until it was neutralized by a new means of stimulation, clothing. 
          (Westermarck, p. 204.) 
        <P>On the other hand, many nations that do not circumcise themselves find 
          the circumcised penis ugly. Antiquity, in its classical works of sculpture, 
          always emphasizes the long foreskin, and very recently, Doiteau attempted 
          to obtain proof, on the basis of an official inquiry at which artists 
          in particular took part, that the penis with the probiscidiform continuation 
          of the foreskin had a finer esthetic effect than the circumcised penis. 
          For this reason Doiteau (p. 173, f. 13) even invented a new method of 
          medicinal circumcision in which this note of the esthetic value of the 
          undenuded penis was given expression: the circumcised penis is made 
          to look as much as possible like one that is normal (uncircumcised). 
          Zacharias, bishop of Chrysopolis, had already explained the circumcision 
          of the sexual organ in particular with the purpose of making no other 
          visible organ weak or ugly (<I>ne aliud membrum aut debile fieret aut 
          turpe, quid publice videretur</I>), and claimed - strangely enough - 
          to have discovered in the prepuce the seat of the evil passion (...<I> 
          in parte illa magis dominatur cupiscentia</I>). (Glasberg, p. 214, note 
          1.) 
        <P>Von Sydow also disavows the esthetic property of the circumcised organ. 
          Von Sydow (p. 141) is of the opinion that, judging by other artificial 
          deformations of parts of the human body, as, for example, the perforation 
          of the ears and lips in order to press rings and blocks into them, some 
          esthetic insert should be determinable for circumcision as well. Von 
          Sydow continues: "While these (deformations) serve the purpose of imparting 
          to the organ in question a specific ornamentation by means of the lip-plug, 
          ear-ring,         </TD></TR></TABLE>

        <P>etc., that is, to enrich the organ artificially, this point of view 
          of the esthetic in the treatment of the masculine sexual organ is, with 
          few exceptions, absolutely unfounded, - it is not a question of embellishment, 
          but of injury (1) that is applied to it. Certainly this organ, as no 
          other, is unprepared to serve as the bearer of a specific ornament. 
          But it, seems really striking that the most important member of the 
          masculine body is never given any more emphasis than by means of ornamented 
          or otherwise artistically displayed penis-tops (cf. on penistops F. 
          Luschan in Mitt. d. Anthr. Ges. Wien, 48 Bd. 1918, S. 67). The Baroque 
          period of Europe, as it is well known, was not the least bit timid in 
          making it visible in clothing. If one compares the solicitude usually 
          exhibited by primitive peoples in the decoration of every one of their 
          other members with the almost hostile joy they seem to take in the injury 
          of the phallus, one will readily heed the theory advanced by psychoanalysis 
          which conceives of circumcision as a self-defence on the part of the 
          old generation against the incestuous and murderous desires of the new". 
          (Th. Reik and M. Zeller are quoted.) "We may doubt whether the more 
          comprehensive problem of primitive rites can be elucidated by this theory 
          with universal validity. Our more important question at present is the 
          reason for the constant aversion to emphasizing the masculine organ 
          by ornamentation. Even if one considers all the puberty rites to be 
          explained, it still remains unexplained why later on, the older generation 
          still does not grant itself (that which out of fear, they would like 
          to suppress in the younger generation), the joy of decorating their 
          own organs, For what reason is this life-long lack of ornamentation 
          especially in this, the most important organ of all?

        <P>accomplishments of psychoanalysts who in their studies of primitive 
          peoples have pointed out that the beginning of the suppression of sexuality 
          is to be found in primitive culture. It is probably to this process 
          that must be ascribed the particular pertinacity with which the masculine 
          sexual organ is denied esthetic appreciation, to which, logically considered, 
          it would have the highest claim". 
        <P>In discussing the mutilation of teeth (p. 146) von Sydow returns to 
          the theme just quoted. "These mutilations of the teeth, which sometimes 
          are of very wide compass, bring us back again to circumcision. For they 
          have this in common, that, in great measure, they mean no enrichment 
          esthetically, but rather the contrary. Tooth and phallus stand in a 
          particularly intimate relationship, the tooth symbolizing the masculine 
          organ in dreams. (Freud: "Traumdeutung", ges. Schr. III, 103 ff.) If 
          we have found ourselves forced to see in circumcision the manifestation 
          of suppression, then we have every reason now to argue a similar motive 
          as the intrinsic and universal reason for these tooth mutilations: In 
          both cases the antipathy against the sexual is expressed in so radical 
          a manner as to allow only the consideration of life and death". 
        <P>The esthetic (erotic) instinct does not rest; and in the end, with 
          the spread of the custom of tattooing, the glans is also drawn into 
          the sphere of those parts of the body to be decorated. Gerland, Joest 
          and Adachi, as well as others, report this. Penis-cases are also worn 
          for similar motives. 
        <P>According to Gerland (Waitz) it is remarkable "that the Polynesians 
          are uncommonly modest in regard to the glans, and still they are accustomed 
          to expose it by slitting the foreskin and (e.g. in Tonga) to tattoo 
          the glans thus exposed".         </TD></TR></TABLE>

        <P>Gerland maintains that at the bottom of this dread of the sight of 
          the glans is not modesty but religiousness; this part was taboo and 
          the sight of it an offence. Gerland is of the opinion that the glans 
          was considered a pre eminent life-dispensing member, just as the navel 
          (which is also tabooed) is considered the point of departure of life, 
          and that it was for this reason that the part was originally provided 
          with a picture or sign of the god. 
        <P>"The foreskin was slit up in order not to hide the life dispensing 
          part of the body, which was particularly holy to the gods; but it was 
          probably much later, when the Polynesian peculiarity had been strongly 
          developed, that it was tied up again in order to withdraw from the gaze 
          of mankind, that portion which on account of its holiness was strictly 
          taboo (i.e., belonged to the gods), in order to prevent a breach of 
          the taboo".(1) 
        <P><FONT SIZE="2">1) Among the inhabitants of Nukahiwa the foreskin is 
          drawn over the glans and tied up with a string (cf. U. Lisiansky, p. 
          86). (B.)</FONT> 
        <P>Waitz remarks on this in a footnote: "Jewish circumcision as well is 
          to be conceived of in essentially the same manner. The connection here 
          is clearly seen: the life dispensing organ is consecrated to God for 
          the promised offspring". 
        <P>Joest (p. 66) likewise mentions that the genitalia are tattooed. Adachi 
          (p. 356) tells of the case of a Japanese dice-player who had on his 
          glans three small, blue points which, during erection, turned out to 
          be three flies. He was particularly proud of this ornament because he 
          had it tattooed on while his penis was in a state of erection. 
        <P>Why or how it is that the exposed glans is considered to have an esthetic 
          advantage will be seen in the treatment of the phallic motive. However, 
          let it be mentioned here, that the circumcised are often not unwilling 
          to display their genitalia. I repeatedly saw circumcised Sebeyi conversing 
          with women with the penis unconcernedly hanging out of their "togas".

        <P>ston this kind of exhibitionism is even considered the right thing 
          to do among the Massai (Westermarck, p. 187). 
        <P>K. Th. Preuss has derived a new explanation for circumcision of a purely 
          magical nature from the tattooing of the glans: "Let us first examine 
          the case of tattooing of the sexual parts-and we must also include in 
          this category those parts of the body in the immediate vicinity of the 
          sexual organs, from the thigh to the navel. In the first place it is 
          necessary that we free ourselves altogether from the idea that primitive 
          man looked upon this natural, animal function, which is almost as usual 
          as metabolism, as correspondingly self-understood and natural. For all 
          magical puberty rites that we know are all primarily directed toward 
          the sexual act. And it is significant that, immediately before coitus, 
          purifications - evidently for the intensification of the magical power 
          - take place. The act then was something magical, not only on account 
          of the condition of excitement connected with it, but also on account 
          of the results of cohabitation. 
        <P>"Consequently, when we find the sexual parts tattooed, we must think 
          of all the magical effects of the sexual orifices and particularly, 
          of course, of the 'magic' of the procreation of children, that are to 
          be imparted all at once at the time of puberty. And if the belief was 
          not present that the youth received this magical power entirely through 
          these ceremonies, there was at least the idea that the latent magical 
          properties had to be awakened and intensified by adjuvant magical means 
          to function. All at once the various kinds of circumcision all over 
          the world become clear. Even today it is here and there expressly stated 
          by the natives that it helps in the procreation of children".

        <P>ological explanation, is the interpretation of Dr. Jacobus X. - -, 
          who places the considerable length of the negro penis in a certain dependent 
          relationship to circumcision. 
        <P>Exact figures on the length of the penis of negroes are given by the 
          French physician Jacobus X . . . In spite of its considerable length 
          (Jacobus X... therefore terms these "truly fearful machines the terror 
          of all black women") the penis is comparatively weak when erected, nor 
          does it ever become as hard as that of the European, Hindu and Chinese, 
          but rather remains as soft as black, elastic caoutehouk. 
        <P>Dr. Jacobus X . . . considers circumcision a probable cause of such 
          hypertrophy of the penis. Karsch (p. 123) remarks on this: "Since, however, 
          circumcision is also customary among many peoples, without giving rise 
          to anything similar, the decisive influence will have to be ascribed 
          to race character". 
        <P>According to Jacobus X... only a small amount of sebaceous smegma is 
          found under the foreskin of the negro; he does not say whether cleanliness 
          or a physiological peculiarity is the cause of it. The as yet uncircumcised 
          foreskin of the negro forms a pad in front of the glans. We have already 
          mentioned the defenders of the <I>Cuibono</I>-consideration who always 
          scent some idea of utility behind every human institution. They place 
          utility in the foreground; it determines circumcision which has the 
          purpose of prophylactically preventing various diseases (Phimosis, gonorrhoea 
          of the glans, balanitis, etc.). The explanation of Michaelis and Sachtleben 
          goes even further, seeing in circumcision a preventative and cure of 
          masturbation. Michaelis (p. 39) learned from an anonymous "knower of

          presumably too painful for one who was circumcised. Referring to this

          that certainly could not be prevented by the greatest care on the part 
          of parents and guardians, and why he had not rather made it universal 
          through the Christian religion? or why he had not created our nature 
          better in the first place, and made it a rule with human beings, what 
          was now only an occasional exception, to be born without the projecting 
          foreskin"?(1) 
        <P><FONT SIZE="2">1) This consideration reminds us of the question of 
          the skeptics (Origines) and the one put to Rabbi Hosaiah (according 
          to Beraschith Raba, Chap. II), why Adam had not been born without the 
          foreskin in the first place. "Man," was the answer of the sage, must 
          perfect himself and make himself what he should be by nature." Moreover, 
          Darwin has already called attention to the fact that in spite of thousands 
          of years of circumcision, the Jews still come into the world with the 
          foreskin. A clear thinker who is acquainted with the nature of heredity 
          can see no reason for circumcision being hereditary. Such a thought 
          could have come only from one whose thinking is prelogical. (B.)</FONT> 
        <P> But Michaelis, after lengthy consideration, doubts the efficiency 
          of circumcision as a preventitive against masturbation, not knowing 
          "whether I should readily believe that there are perhaps several varieties 
          of onanism (2) that become painful to one who is circumcised".
        <P> <FONT SIZE="2">2) Michaelis seems to know of several modes of masturbation 
          which he calls "the sin of the apes." Why not of human beings? Manustupration 
          was not observed in apes in nature and is probably a result of their 
          captivity. (B.) </FONT>
        <P>Sachtleben (p. 107) is even more apodictic than Michaelis in respect 
          to the effectiveness of circumcision. He writes (p. 103): "circumcision 
          - as a preventitive and cure of onanism - may be performed not only 
          on children, but also youths and even adults without any danger to life 
          or any other disadvantage to health ... Circumcision is probably very 
          much more powerful and perhaps the most effective of all means ... The 
          pain (3) involved in the onanism or manustupration of those who are 
          circumcised is much too severe not to outweigh the pleasure combined 
          with the act. But this pain must be all the greater and inevitable the 
          more sensitive the tip of the glans is -the <I>corona glandis</I>- and 
          the higher the tension caused by the shortened foreskin in erection, 
          as it resists the pleasurable friction of the glans".

        <P>He calls this quite untenable conception "my favorite hypothesis". 
          In the year 1842 this fantastic conception still stalks abroad. The 
          Frenchman Lallemand (p. 161) saw in circumcision a useful cure "for 
          involuntary seminal emissions", and for that reason himself introduced 
          circumcision against pollutions.
        <P>Also according to Jacobus X ... the circumcised negro seems to tend 
          less toward onanism than the uncircumcised. According to this author 
          masturbation very seldom occurs among the Senegal negroes. 
        <P>"The friction of the very sensitive mucous membrane of the glans of 
          the circumcised organ requires a considerably longer time for a seminal 
          ejaculation in copulation. Only the uncircumcised Senegal boy masturbates 
          by drawing out the foreskin to a considerable length. But if he is circumcised 
          he considers masturbation opprobrious; moreover he now has women enough 
          to satisfy his sexual desires". (Karsch, p. 170.) 
        <P>The statement that circumcised people do not masturbate or cannot even 
          masturbate is absolutely false. Manustupration is wide-spread among 
          the Jews (compare the blessing of the <I>mohel</I>,), the same is true 
          of the Islamitic Indians, among whom it is called "<I>jalakh</I>" and 
          is usually performed by plucking the frenulum about until the orgasm 
          sets in, which circumcised Arians also do in Europe. Also a circumcised 
          negro (Sebeyi) masturbated in my presence. Moreover, the Talmud forbids 
          onanism in men and women. (Wunderbar, p. 27.) Danz, in his effort to 
          disprove Schtleben is guilty of exaggeration in the opposite direction 
          when he maintains that circumcision even encourages manustupration. 
          He makes the observation that "children who by nature had a short foreskin 
          and relatively exposed glans become manustuprists".(1)

        <P>onanism instead of preventing it. Salomon is of a similar opinion, 
          and he was circumcised himself. 
        <P>Salomon (p. 26) not only does not believe that masturbation is made 
          impossible by circumcision, but that "on the contrary it is to be assumed 
          that as a result of the greater accessibility of the denuded glans, 
          and the stronger friction to which it is exposed, the sensation is intensified 
          and onanism only furthered although the objection could again be made 
          that the glans, having been exposed since childhood, must have suffered 
          a considerable loss of sensitivity. However, the results, in respect 
          to the prevalence of this evil, have shown no material advantages, and 
          thus the law of circumcision seems to have no connection with onanism". 
        <P>And now we have the suggestion propounded by Tessman (pp. 99-101), 
          which is magical and based on a mimetic motive (like that of Philo): 
          in this case the serpent. The negro or primitive man endeavored to make 
          his sexual organ similar to the holy beast, with which he identified 
          his penis. 
        <P>"The religious motives for circumcision are more manifest, and, moreover, 
          are advanced as arguments by many peoples. It is generally insisted 
          by the Pangweh that better 'appearance' (1) had induced them to it, 
          but how did they come to think it 'appeared' better, when the organ 
          was circumcised? The answer may be derived from the thought of the 'first 
          man' explained on page 26 to excuse his sexual sin with the serpent, 
          and from the assumption that they wished to emphasize still more strongly 
          the similarity between the penis and the serpent by means of circumcision. 
          The old Jewish expression, that circumcision was a covenant with God, 
          could be said to be most appropriate, for since God had sent the serpent, 
          from whom all sin comes, there is actually a connection, a covenant 
          set up between the two. Since they arise from

        <P>similar views, circumcision and cults coincide among many negroes, 
          so that one may actually speak of circumcision festivals. Among the 
          Pangweh this is not the case, circumcision being performed quite independently 
          of the cults and in public".
        <P> According to Tessmann the serpent is simply the personification of 
          the penis, as can be seen from this Pangweh riddle:<BR>
          "ebo nkok, e mine fe, i' <BR>

          into which creeps a rhinoceros-snake".(1)

        <P>I called Tessmann's explanation magical because, just like primitive 
          man, he concludes the origin, the motive, from the effect. The whole 
          serpent cult may be derived from a similar prelogical combination On 
          account of the external similarity of the serpent with the phallus they 
          were often confused and the serpent cult could in this manner be connected 
          with the phallus cult, of which it is the derivative and imitation; 
          as a result of this it was believed that the ancestor slept in the serpent 
          and visited the woman in this form: "One finds this conviction among 
          the Nandi of Africa who kill snakes, but spare those that sleep near 
          the bed(2) of a woman.

        <P><FONT SIZE="2">3) When I sojourned among the Nandi for several months, 
          the following was told about giant snakes, &quot;If the serpent "gjalagvit" 
          is given no beer, it devours people. If a moran (circumcised man) is 
          going to the dance and catches sight of it at the root of a tree, he 
          runs away. Then the old men (boyot) come with a pan of beer; it drinks 
          up the beer, sleeps for two days and then goes its way." (B.) </FONT>

          phallus. It can also be used for the feminine organs, since all symbols 
          are bi-sexual". 
        <P>Modern oneiroscopy gives a phallic interpretation to dreams of snakes, 
          which are no rarity among women.(3) (Stekel, p. 111.)

          21) is also a phallic symbol, and that the broken or cut handle of an 
          umbrella is an allusion to circumcision! </FONT> 
        <P>The erect penis has always had the effect of growing, fructifying life 
          on the power and realm of human imagination and was therefore worshipped 
          everywhere as the phallus. Circumcision is beyond doubt intimately bound 
          up with this worship. Vatke, (p. 380) says: "Even circumcision could 
          have emanated from the Syrian and Phoenician cult, or at least have 
          become attached (4) to it very easily without the androgynous conception 
          of the nature of the god having been fundamental. For since the sexual 
          function was considered the main factor in the divine life, and the 
          sexual organ, as the phallus cult shows, holy, there could easily have 
          become attached to it the conception of total or partial sacrifice of 
          it, and one need hardly assume that later circumcision was a substitute 
          for previous customary castration, in the sense of the priests of Cybele 
          or Rhea." 
        <P><FONT SIZE="2">4) "The probable origin of circumcision can be determined 
          only from a view fundamentally similar to this, since other motives, 
          fruitfulness or cleanliness, cannot stand strict tests." 179 </FONT>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

        <P>Further investigations have made valuable contributions not only in 
          demonstrating the phallic cult among the Israelites, but also in showing 
          that circumcision was dependent on it. Benzinger (p. 121) considers 
          circumcision "a means whereby was expressed the concept of consecration 
          to the life producing power of nature (Ishtar-Ashtoreth, Tammuz-Adonis, 
          etc.). Consonant with this is the fact that among most peoples circumcision 
          is connected with marriage. Also in Israel, it was originally not the 
          children but the marriageable youths who were circumcised. (Joshua, 
          5, 2-9, Gen. 34, 4-25.) <I>That is, it was originally in no way connected 
          with the Yahweh cult among the Israelites</I>".(1)
        <P><FONT SIZE="2">1) My emphasis. It is important that this discovery 
          finally penetrate the consciousness of authors dealing with the material 
          treated here, in order that once and for all the former speculative, 
          uncritical statement of the monotheistic origin of circumcision be scrapped, 
          and it be finally recognized that it obviously is derived from phallic 
          worship. (B.)</FONT> 
        <P> We have already discussed the relations between the serpent and the 
          prepuce, The Cabalists say: "The foreskin comes from the first serpent 
          which seduced Adam and Eve". "The serpent shall eat earth. The foreskin 
          is <I>mecach hannachasch hakadmoni,</I> i.e., of the power of the first 
          serpent, therefore the foreskin must be given to the serpent again to 
          eat". (Bodenschatz, p. 67.) -Also "to the tribe of Levi was ascribed 
          extensive ophidian descent, and indeed, its totem was a serpent" (Majocchi, 
          p. 443). 
        <P>It is no matter of chance that it was the very tribe of Levi, which, 
          according to Preuss, retained circumcision although the others had long 
          before abolished it. More on the phallic cult of the Jews may be found 
          in Delaure. 
        <P>Karsch says on this (pp. 158-159): "According to H. H. Johnston's description 
          the phallic cult is probably nowhere so open and general in Africa as 
          it is at Stanley Pool. In the forests there are wonderful temples of 
          straw and wood containing the phallic symbol. So far as the         </TD></TR></TABLE>

        <P>guarantor could determine there were no really lascivious ceremonies 
          connected with the phallic worship, at least the symbols were in the 
          eyes of the natives mere objects of veneration. The boys taking part 
          in initiation festivals are circumcised, and at the consecration, which 
          is a phallic service, apparently only men are present. They are called 
          <I>inkimba</I>, and are boys of fourteen and men to forty years of age. 
          They form a sort of Freemason society in which there are certain pass-words 
          or signs and also a kind of secret language, as in the case of certain 
          Australian tribes".

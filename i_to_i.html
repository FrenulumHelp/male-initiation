        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:   My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                                <P>This chapter is the original and central piece of this project.

                                                        to Manhood</B></A>. is a collection of email quotes illustrating a variety 
                                                        of embarrassing and alarming common experiences. Many letters indicated that when doctors have interfered they have done damage. 
                                <P>Sometimes a full circumcision is performed previous 
                                                        to the mother holding her new born baby.          This  most extreme form of routine male circumcision, appears  anatomically to cause many new problems, mostly due to the lack of post op. check-up. On the other hand, until recent years  some doctors have advised forcing the foreskin back, many letters showed this has traumatic consequences.          
                                <P><B>Phimosis becomes &quot;active&quot; and worrying around puberty </B>. Up until puberty, gentle prevention is all that is required.                                                       
                                <P>Around puberty, when left to nature, it appears boys run around a 10% risk of suffering a degree of phimosis. Problems are treated  following infections or experiences of pain, difficulty or discomfort during 
            masturbation, or after difficulties during intercourse. 
                                <P>A young boy experiencing pain or difficulty with his penis will 
                                                        be worried, embarrassed, 
                                                        or maybe even scared that his penis is somehow &quot;wrong&quot;. 
                                                        On the first steps to manhood such pain can have far reaching consequences.</P>
<P>However, in some cases our brave explorer simply does not realise 
that retracting his foreskin is possible, normal or desirable. He 
intuitively avoids any approaching pain and he adapts to his limitation 
without experiencing it as a difficulty.  He grows accustomed 
                                                        to his body as it is, never questioning nature. Himself subject to the taboo.
                                <P> If he is lucky he will discover his condition following failure 
                                                        or pain during first intercourse. However, often he will enter adulthood adapting his self image and behaviour to accommodate 
                                                        his anatomical limitations, creating a basis for confusion 
                                                        and distress in all his intimate relationships<I>.</I>
                                <P><B>When boys are left alone with such problems it means that many will have a fully distorted first impression 
                                                        of sex and manhood. An absurdly mismanaged passage to manhood, arguably 
                                                        more bizarre than any primitive customs.</B>

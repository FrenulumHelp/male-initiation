  sexuality appears to contradict every advance in understanding which our culture 
  has made over the last century. - Psychological research has concentrated on parental 
          and environmental phenomenon, and the urological disciplines do not 
          include sexual behaviour. Scientific research has overlooked this area 
          of human sexuality. </FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              the full opportunities of manhood may be denied for many complicated 
                              psycho-social reasons which are discussed in many large volumes of 
                              books, here we are discussing a simple fact of life which has been 
                              overlooked. And how easy it would be to resolve, how ridiculous that 
                              this extra complication became established in the first place).

                                    can - over time, adapt their beliefs and thinking patterns to accommodate 
                                    their anatomical conditions.&quot;</B></A><B>. When a problem is conscious, an individual has the choice of confronting 
                                      it, and by confronting it can even turn it to some greater strength. 
                                      On the other hand, when unknown to the individual he's fighting his 
                                      own closest friend, how many self deceptions would he accept in order

                            <P>Both the subconscious and semi-conscious experiences limit and confuse reality. Over a period of time as situations and lovers are repeatedly mis-sensed and misinterpreted, the sufferer learns to live with a one sided and unbalanced picture of himself and the world. </P>
                            <P>Attitudes and intentions adapt to accommodate the illusion of normality or the doubts of abnormality; the inconsistencies become integrated, (alternatively the personality becomes disintegrated) . Similar to the incest victim or the person who represses his homosexuality, the personality adapts to and adopts this irrational chaos element. </P>
                            <P>His experience of what defines him as man is limited, inhibited 
                    and avoided, how can he develop a realistic sense of being a man or 
                    any realistic confidence (Latin <I>fidere</I> 'trust') in his maleness? 
                    Foreskin inhibitions can never support and would always undermine fulfilment 
                    and sexual confirmation as a man. </P>
                            <P>It is impossible to define the consequences in any absolute terms, 
                              unrecognised foreskin conditions are best understood as an inhibition 
                              with the tendency to stimulate isolation. They add an unnecessary confusing 
                              ingredient to intimate relationships and subsequently social relations 
                              of all sorts. They are compatible with shyness, privacy, anxiety, frustration 
                              and loneliness, and they are incompatible with a relaxed sexuality, 
                              openness in intimate relationships and thus, happiness and leading 
                              a simple life.

                                His intimacy with his own body reflects in any and every close relationship. 
                                Without this intimacy and the integration with himself and others,

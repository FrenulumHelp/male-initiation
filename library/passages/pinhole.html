        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                            <TD><P><B>PINHOLE PHIMOSIS AT 30</B>
                              <P>Im writing you this from Norway so excuse my English. 
                              <P>I will tomorrow have an operation where they will remove my foreskin. 
                                I just found your website and I see that my problem are explained in 
                                detail in your Phimosis section. </P>
                              <P>Im an adult 30 years old and all my years I had problem with tight 
                                foreskin. I have never been able to retract and my penis look more 
                                like what you describe like an infant (dolphin nose). My phimotic 
                                ring is very small and tight. I think what you describe as a pinhole 
                                phimosis is a more correct description of my problem. I recognize 
                                eveything you write about full phimosis in detail, like "not being 
                                able to shake all the urine out, and the consequent wet trouser". 
                                But I have always been careful and never had any infections. And 
                                I had no pain when erected and masturbating, only a bit sore after 
                                erection. </P>
                              <P>You also wrote this: <BR>
  "Throughout adolescence as behavioural patterns develop, youths grow 
                                accustomed to their condition, either believing themselves to be normal, 
                                or if they do recognise their phimosed status some men obviously grow 
                                to prefer it. Intercourse is possible though this depends on the degree 
                                of lubrication and openness of the vagina and the brutality of penetration" </P>
                              <P>Well I have never grow to prefer this, its always been a problem, 
                                and I have never been naked in front of girls because of this. Only 
                                fear have stopped me go to the doctors. So I wish I could have been 
                                normal but now I feel its too late and maybe the final result after 
                                tomorrow will be no sexual activity at all. Because of strong psychological 
                                problems I havent been visiting the doctors until this year. I never 
                                had any sexual activity other than masturbating . </P>
                              <P>Tomorrow the urologist will remove some part of the foreskin and 
                                I just hope he knows what he's doing. I am reading it now and hope 
                                to learn more about this but now the rest is up to the urologhist that 
                                will operate me tomorrow.</P>
                              <P>________________________________________</P>
                              <P>Thanks for your reply,<BR>
                                  <BR>
                                I havent had the operation yet because I didnt understand the <BR>
                                urologist, the only option he could help me with was full <BR>
                                circumcision.<BR>
  <BR>
                                So tomorrow I have a meeting with another urologist and I will ask 
                                him what he thinks about stretchimg the foreskin. I have talked to 
                                several people on ARC and they have similar problems like mine and 
                                they suggest I try to stretch and using creams. I dont think it can 
                                work with my pinhole phimosis but people tell me <BR>
                                that it will so I guess its worth a try.<BR>
                              </P>
                              <P>But the urologist I meet tomorrow will maybe ask me to have a partial <BR>
                                circumcision and I will maybe accept that. I just wish I knew about 
                                the other threatments when I was younger, I never believed it was possible 
                                to stretch foreskins like that. I never felt normal like other young 
                                people when I grew up.<BR>
                                And I was hiding away from any sexual activity. So I will be happy 
                                the day I feel normal like anyone else.</P>
                              <P>________________</P>
                              <P>Finally I meet a urologist with some sense, I was reliefed when 
                                he <BR>
                                told me he would not remove alot of the foreskin and he knew that in <BR>
                                my case with full phimosis since birth a complete circumcision would <BR>
                                only lead to severe problems for me. <BR>
  <BR>
                                RS. This does sound very good its not often thaqt I hear this from 
                                the <BR>
                                doctors, and did the cut go OK anatomically and how does it feel <BR>
                                sexually different?<BR>
  <BR>
                                give us a call in a couple of years, be patient , changes take time, 
                                good luck ... <BR>
                                Robin</P>
                              <P> ________________</P>
                              <P>Thanks for your reply! You have been really helpful.<BR>
                                  <BR>
                                Its been 5 months since the surgery and Im feeling ok.<BR>
  <BR>
                                Which means that masturbation is no longer painful. &nbsp;<BR>
                                Still after following your and other advices (vitamin E cremes, baby <BR>
                                powder on head) the penis head is still very sensitive. I can touch <BR>
                                it without pain when erected but when I try to rub it with my fingers <BR>
                                its terrible feeling and ofcourse during sexual contact its not a <BR>
                                good feeling.<BR>
  <BR>
                                Telling you this if the urologist had performed a full <BR>
                                circumcision my life would have been hell, the pain when the foreskin <BR>
                                not protecting the head and trousers rubbing against it is very <BR>
                                painful.<BR>
  <BR>
                                Sorry bout my english. </P>

        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                                from the underside of the head (where the V is I think, he won't let 
                                me see). He also sometimes has problems inserting as the foreskin is 
                                being pulled backwards and the bit under the head stretches/hurts.</P>
                              <P> &gt;(is there meant to be a fold still or when you pull back is 
                                it meant to look smooth?) What can I tactfully suggest </P>
                              <P>you are describing frenulum breve, - a great many men with this 
                                condition - without thinking -simply blindly- have an unconscious fear 
                                of circumcision, the point is frenulum breve does not require circumcision, 
                                - tell him that frenulum breve needs no circumcision and slowly rational 
                                thoughts may dawn on him ... further, the welcome page on my site would 
                                have enabled you an accurate diagnosis - please read the welcome page 
                                now and then get him to read it, .. all the links to further information 
                                and treatment of this condition are obvious </P>

                              <P> When we are having sex, my boyfriend sometimes has pain or bleeds 
                                from the underside of the head (where the V is I think, he won't let 
                                me see). He also sometimes has problems inserting as the foreskin is 
                                being pulled backwards and the bit under the head stretches/hurts. 
                              <P> What is the problem and is there anyway to solve it rather than 
                                going to the doctor - it's kind of a touchy/embarassing subject for 
                                him, something abou this manliness being questioned so I have to be 
                                tactful. 
                              <P> Also, he sometimes smells a bit fishy/yucky under the foreskin 
                                as I think it doesn't go all the way back (is there meant to be a fold 
                                still or when you pull back is it meant to look smooth?) What can I 
                                tactfully suggest especially if it is a movement problem of the foreskin. 
                                BTW there is no visible substance. 
                              <P> Thanks!!

                                As an answer to: Boyfriend written by cyndi at 21 Nov 2000 10:03:54: 
                              <P>The fishy/yucky smell is due to bacteria that grow in the warm moist 
                                area under the foreskin. You can wash with soap and water, of course, 
                                but it is difficult to control them unless the area can be kept dry, 
                                as it is after circumcision or permanent retraction of the foreskin. 
                              <P> So far as the bleeding problem is concerned, if he will let you, 
                                you might be able to help by gently stretching the foreskin after you 
                                apply sweet oil under it, and by trying to pull it back enough to completely 
                                loosen the frenulum and free the foreskin to totally uncover the glans. 
                                ... If you can get him to allow you to handle him gently as a part 
                                of pre-sexual foreplay (as some couples customarily do) you may be 
                                able to help him get over the problem. However, if all else fails and 
                                it continues to interfere with your enjoyment of sex, you ought to 
                                drag him, kicking screaming if he insists, to a doctor who can (without 
                                much question) put a stop to the problem in a hurry with a minimum 
                                of pain. By the way, it's no more a reflection on his manliness to 
                                see a doctor for a problem in this area than it would be to see one 
                                for a sore throat that doesn't heal. Lots of luck, RJK.

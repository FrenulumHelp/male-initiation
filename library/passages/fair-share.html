        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                            <TD><P><B>FAIR SHARE of POST CIRC: PROBLEMS</B>
                              <P>>Firstly I would like to congratulate you on an excellent site which 
                                is very informative.</P>
                              <P>>I am a male of 28 years of age and have until recently suffered 
                                from congenital phimosis. I opted for a partial circ which did take 
                                some convincing to get the doctor to perform as he was more in favour 
                                of a full circ. .....I got my way. </P>
                              <P>>During the surgery the doctor also separated the major adhesions 
                                which were exposed (70 % of the glans). Unfortunately throughout the 
                                healing process of the circ the foreskin again adhered to the glans 
                                (only to approx 50%). </P>
                              <P>>A second operation to remove the adhesions was again only partially 
                                successful. The doctor at the same time performed a frenuloplasty due 
                                to a frenulum breve which existed. This was also only partially successful. 
                                There are still adhesions around the rim of the glans as well as a 
                                fairly severe frenulum breve. An additional side effect of the operations 
                                has been a restriction of the urinary opening which has reduced to 
                                a 1mm opening restricting urine flow and causing the urinary tract 
                                to balloon behind the glans as a result of the pressure.</P>
                              <P>>It appears that I am having more than my share of difficulties 
                                with this situation. The surgeon who performed the two operations is 
                                a general surgeon and I have considered contacting either a urologist 
                                or a plastic surgeon for the third attempt at corrective surgery as 
                                the results thus far have not been too aesthetically pleasing either.</P>
                              <P>>I would appreciate any advice you may be able to offer.</P>

                              <P>yes I agree, you do seem to have had your fair share .... its hell, 
                                and then even worse is if you start seeing therapists and psychologists, 
                                because they seem to think that "genital pain is all in the brain" 
                                ... sorry I havent much clue about treatments ... the complicatiuons 
                                caused by late treament emphasise how important it is to check and 
                                treat early.</P>
                              <P>all I really know is that men need to talk publicly about the sexual 
                                problems they have had with adhesions, frenulum etc. .... only then 
                                will the medical profession start realising the importance of treating 
                                them properly.</P>

        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P>Hi there.<BR>
                                Thanks for the reply. But don't worry, I'm no anti or pro circer fanatic. 
                                I'm far too uninformed for that....!</P>
                              <P>I'd like to stress first of all that this is something which I would 
                                rarely consider doing. It's the first real correspondence I've made, 
                                but I'm prepared to give it a go. I've only been on-line for a few 
                                month's, but have discovered that if you're prepared to filter through 
                                most of the crap on the internet, then it can be an amazing resource.</P>
                              <P>Which leads me neatly onto your site, but let me give you a little 
                                detail about myself: 19 yo male, active and healthy, from a quiet family 
                                of married parents and one brother. I'm no extrovert, or excessively 
                                confident either, and since our family unit is not particularly open 
                                or close it makes discussing these matters too embarrassing all round 
                                to even attempt(!)</P>
                              <P>Not sure what relevance this might have, but it puts you in the 
                                picture.</P>
                              <P>Anyway, to get to the point. I first noticed that my foreskin was 
                                tight when I was about nine or ten. At that age it was impossible to 
                                retract it anyway near the base of the glans even in a flaccid state, 
                                but it was fun (although painful) trying! Anyway, at that age it's 
                                not something you worry about. I was too busy playing football to care. 
                                You don't expect to have any flaws in your body, and if you do then 
                                you don't expect them to impact upon your life.</P>
                              <P>I think I first realised that there might actually be something 
                                wrong when I first practiced with condoms. I can't remember at what 
                                age this was - probably in a mid-teen phase. But I found them very 
                                difficult to put on properly. I remember reading the instuction leaflet 
                                and seeing "roll back foreskin fully" glaring at me. 'Okay', I thought 
                                'I'll roll back my foreskin as far as it will go, put on the condom 
                                and let it roll forward again'. Simple!. You must remember that in 
                                the beginning of all this, I thought that every man was the same, and 
                                that it was a problem everyone had to overcome. It was something I'd 
                                just have to get used to.</P>
                              <P>Eventually I'd get the condom on, using a combination of both hands 
                                legs and maybe even feet(?!) to hold my foreskin back near the base 
                                of the glans while I struggled to roll it on. Once in place the foreskin 
                                would naturally roll forward (quite naturally so, since that always 
                                happened), and eventually the tip of the condom would rip, time after 
                                time. But sometimes it didn't, and I convinced myself then that I didn't 
                                really have a problem, and it was more likely the fault of the condom 
                                itself. In hindsight I wasn't really pulling hard, just keeping the 
                                movements short subconciously in order to prevent too much strain on 
                                the tip of the condom.</P>
                              <P>At some point it dawned that I perhaps did have a fault. I can't 
                                pinpoint this, but maybe after reading "roll foreskin back" in every 
                                packet of three one too many times, a stream of split condoms, and 
                                the difficulty I had in actually getting the things on, kinda convinced 
                                me...</P>
                              <P>It was by chance that I heared about the frenuloplasty. I read about 
                                it in an advice column in a mens magazine in the dentists surgery when 
                                I was about 16. The doctor had given advice to the writer who complained 
                                of a tight foreskin, and pain when making love. The word frenuloplasty 
                                stayed with me.</P>
                              <P>At 17, I got sexually active for the first time. I spent a week 
                                with a long distance girlfriend determined to make love. Foreplay was 
                                fine, but I was struck down by condoms. Again I found it difficult 
                                to put them on, struggling to pull them over my glans and foreskin, 
                                which by this age could be retracted to the base of the glans when 
                                erect but would still roll forward by itself. During the first penetration 
                                the condom split. This led to a lot of panic and a close shave with 
                                an unwanted pregnancy. I haven't had a sexual relationship since.</P>
                              <P>By curiosity I reached your site a few months ago after going on 
                                line. The search under frenuloplasty took me there, and it could turn 
                                out to be the most useful I've visited.</P>
                              <P>So there's the background.</P>
                              <P>From what I can gather I suffer primarily from frenulum breve. When 
                                I retract my foreskin it pulls the glans forward (or downwards?). It 
                                rolls back of it's own accord, and I can only reach the base of the 
                                glans when first erect - although a little further after masturbation. 
                                As I said, at a young age I couldn't even reach that far when flaccid, 
                                so there has been some progress I suppose.</P>
                              <P>I also picked up on phimosis, or the phimotic ring(?). The foreskin 
                                does seem particularly tight in one area more than any other. The skin 
                                forms a ring and this is tipped with a small lump of skin, where the 
                                pain seems to occurr.</P>
                              <P>I can't really make any sort of clarification between which is more 
                                likely - phimosis or frenulum breve - without an expert opinion. I 
                                haven't yet visited a GP, but know that I have to do it sooner rather 
                                than later. I start at University in October, and would obviously like 
                                it sorted before then.</P>
                              <P>It's just a matter of courage I guess, but I have two main fears; 
                                firstly the embarrassment for me, and the doctor. And secondly, that 
                                he won't know enough about the subject to form a correct opinion and 
                                simply recommend a full circumcision - the last thing that I want.</P>
                              <P>Anyway, I thought that this information may be useful to you, to 
                                provide information and help for others. There is certainly a great 
                                deal of ignorance surrounding the subject, and I can't help but feel 
                                that more people are suffering the problem in silence than you imagine, 
                                simply because of a lack of awareness. A thorough statistical investigation 
                                really should be carried out.</P>
                              <P>I can't believe sometimes that I left school without even hearing 
                                about the frenulum, or phimosis, and despair when I know that this 
                                should really have been done at birth. It makes me both embarrassed 
                                and angry that I spent all of these years under the illusion that no 
                                male could ever fully retract their foreskin(!).</P>
                              <P>If you have any questions feel free to ask, I'll answer as honestly 
                                as I can.</P>
                              <P>But I will seek the proper medical advice thanks to your site. And 
                                I will keep you well informed of the process throughout, from start 
                                to finish, if you wish.</P>
                              <P>Yours, for now,</P>
                              <P>------------------------<BR>

                              <P>I suspect that the vast majority of men with such problems, are 
                                confused by our cultural myth that "everyone's normal" ... I suspect 
                                that the only voices which have been raised on this subject are the 
                                fanatical antis or pros, those men who have had vivid conscious experiences, 
                                ... its far too embarrassing for people like us to talk about our experiences 
                                because of our other cultural myth "all sexual problems are psychological" 
                                ... I express this all better on line ... apologies for condensed version 
                                ...</P>
                              <P>Your experiences with condoms are also familiar, I had one fly across 
                                the room, I presume this was the spring action of the frenulum - with 
                                the ring of the phimosis hitched behind the glans it made a perfect 
                                missile launching ramp.</P>
                              <P>>>From what I can gather I suffer primarily from frenulum breve. 
                                When I <BR>

                              <P>This is a perfect description of frenulum breve, however I dont 
                                understand the following </P>
                              <P>>and I can only reach the base of the glans when <BR>
  >first erect - although a little further after masturbation.</P>
                              <P>The only thing fren. br. can be confused with is a skin bridge .... 
                                ? a brief look at the summary of the conditions, ... is it a wall of 
                                skin, or just a single bridge between foreskin and glans?</P>
                              <P>>I also picked up on phimosis, or the phimotic ring(?). The foreskin

                              <P>You probably have both, as I had, --- what is particularly confusing 
                                is the little lump of skin, this almost sounds like a little wart ...

                              <P>You need to get well informed to guard against doctors with routine

                              <P>maybe check the skin bridge?, but you seem to know that you need 
                                a frenuloplasty, or frenulotomy, then possibly, very probably in fact, 
                                if yours is the remnant of an infant phimotic ring, then it should 
                                stretch ... do you want to attempt this, or go for a half circ. or

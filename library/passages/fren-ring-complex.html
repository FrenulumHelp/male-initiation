        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P>Dear Sir/Sirs,<BR>
                                I am not quite sure who I am addressing but I have found your internet 
                                site very useful. I am 18 years old and have been in a sexual relationship 
                                for some months. I have had phimosis, I think, since I was born but 
                                it has not been until now that I have realised it's consequences.</P>
                              <P>During Masturbation I do not retract the foreskin, but in sexual 
                                intercourse the foreskin is pulled painfully back and gets stuck in 
                                the sulcus behind the glans.</P>
                              <P>From what I can determine myself, it would seem that it is the frenulum 
                                which is causing the problem, because it's tightness makes a thin ring 
                                in my foreskin- and this is the part which appears to get stuck.</P>
                              <P>I am unable to reach orgasm like this and what is more, have on 
                                occasions lost erection due to the pain. If you could give me any advice 
                                as to how to go about sorting this embarrassing and painful problem 
                                I would be most.....most grateful.</P>
                              <P>Yours sincerely. </P>
                              <P>Thanks for your letter and Robin Stuart at your service </P>
                              <P>The only urgent problem seems that you must be able to control a 
                                paraphimosis, (the thin ring which gets stuck in the sulcus) there 
                                is a very short practical file on this:<BR>
                                http://www.rrz.uni-hamburg.de/fo-p1/paraphimosis.html</P>
                              <P>From the recent research I've been doing, it seems almost 100% sure 
                                that when a phimotic ring has existed since birth, then it can be stretched<BR>
                                http://www.rrz.uni-hamburg.de/fo-p1/stretching.html</P>
                              <P>Your description of the connection between the phimotic ring and 
                                the frenulum is very interesting - I also had such a connection, there 
                                are so many different degrees of these conditions, that it is impossible 
                                to give a generalised answer, ... A full circumcision cures all these 
                                problems quickly simply and without further thought, ... with further 
                                thought, maybe a removal of the frenulum and/or a partial circumcision 
                                or stretching could be advisable, ... in order to decide this please 
                                see<BR>

                                It would be good when you can fully understand your condition before 
                                you go to a doctor.</P>
                              <P>... It does sound as though you have frenulum breve AND a partial 
                                phimosis ... Thank your lucky starts that you disovered it at 18 yrs. 
                                old, ...</P>
                              <P>I think its fairly important to keep a cool head, you are certainly 
                                not alone with this sort of problem, no need to panic, but it could 
                                take a month or two to sort out.</P>
                              <P>Do you know a doctor who you like? A urologist is the specialist 
                                for such things, an older doctor is more likely to be sympathetic, 
                                in that I believe nothing is taught on this subject in the training, 
                                (except how to perform a circ.) the older docs have had more experience 
                                of what the problems are.</P>
                              <P>Hope that's some help<BR>
                                Keep in touch<BR>

        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P>My doctor told me I "HAD" to get circd and that there was no other 
                                way around it. I didnt believe him and asked him about "betamethasone 
                                .05%" creme. He said it didnt work but that he'd humor me and write 
                                a prescription. 
                              <P>In about 7 weeks my foreskin could go back even while erect. 
                              <P>My foreskin was so tight it could go back past the meatus (pee slit) 
                                while soft. When I first saw there was a problem, I tried stretching 
                                it in the shower, I tried soaking it in warm water then stretching 
                                it, I tried hand lotion and stretching it etc. None of it worked *for 
                                me*. 
                              <P>I applied betamethasone once or twice a day to the outside for my 
                                foreskin from the opening to about mid-glans. I saw results in the 
                                first week. I applied it after I got out of the shower each morining. 
                                I put enough on so that the foreskin was entirely covered (but not 
                                so much that it all wipes off onto your pants). It would soak in, and 
                                most days I would mastrabate. That would stretch it along with sex. 
                                But I never made any real serious attempts to purposely stretch my 
                                foreskin for the sake of stretching it.<BR>

                              <P>I applied enough to make the skin white and left my underwear off 
                                for about 10 minutes to let it soak into the skin and not wipe off 
                                on my pants. I also did a little strecthing: you'll start to see results 
                                in the first week. Once you start seeing them pull your foreskin back 
                                as far as it will go (without pain) while soft. Then get an erection 
                                while holding the skin back. It sounds painful but really isnt. <BR>
                                At the end of 8 weeks your skin should be easily retractable (even 
                                while hard!!). Though while erect it may hurt a bit. DONT WORRY ABOUT 
                                THAT!!! As you mastrabate, have sex etc it will loosen up. Trust me 
                                ;)<BR>
                                Its easy guys. Just takes some time.<BR>

                              <P> &gt;I've been applying this 0.1% cream for about 3 weeks now, twice 
                                a day - after taking a shower in the morning and before going to bed. 
                                I put it mostly on the outside, starting from the tip over about 2 
                                cm long area. So far, I see no apparent result. From some other messages 
                                in this group, I figured that people use 0.5% cream. Does that mean 
                                that it will take me 5 times longer to see any result? Or is there 
                                something wrong with my application technique?<BR>

                              <P> You can't just put it on and sit there and stare at it. The cream 
                                contains a skin thinning agent that assists YOU in stretching the skin. 
                                You have to either work the foreskin back and forth, or get two fingers 
                                into the opening and stretch it wider. It may take days, or it may 
                                take weeks to see results. Some say results are only temporary, unless 
                                you keep on using the cream and stretching as needed. Others say that 
                                when you can get it stretched enough to get it retracted and keep it 
                                that way at least some of the time, such as during sleep, there will 
                                be a constant pressure from the wider part of the penis behind the 
                                tip that will prevent it closing up tight again like before. Yes, the 
                                .5% is five times more concentrated than the .1%, but watch out for 
                                allergic reaction to the stronger mix. 
                              <P>(note: I am totally against the experimental use of creams to treat 
                                children - its a lot of mess and upset) - RS 
                              <P> A third forum letter from Roxanne<BR>
                              <P>About the Kenalog (you're right it does sound like a breakfast cereal), 
                                I'm no chemist either, but I imagine it's a synthetic hormone like 
                                cortisone (probably a cortisone derivative) and I believe it works 
                                on mouth ulcers and phimosis because it thins out the skin just enough 
                                to have the desired effect. There was no stretching required when I 
                                used it on my son. You could literally see the opening widen by the 
                                day. Only after we had used it for about a week and the hole had opened 
                                up quite a bit did we attempt retraction. I believe that if we had 
                                used the cream for another week as prescribed, before attempting this, 
                                the paraphimosis would never have occurred. 
                              <P>Kenalog (Triacinolone Acetonide .1% - corticosteroid, anti-inflammmatory, 
                                anti-pruritic cream), is what we were prescribed and found to be very 
                                effective. This is what we will probably use again when my son is older. 
                                After all, if it's safe enough to put in your mouth for ulcers, putting 
                                it elsewhere shouldn't be a concern.<BR>

: <B>THE EXPERIMENTAL USE OF CREAMS: a loose collection of ideas, info., 
and letters</B></P>
                              <P>The use of cream is a very experimental area.. I AM TOTALLY AGAINST 
                                THE USE OF CREAMS IN EXPERIMENTAL ATTEMPTS TO TREAT CHILDREN; until 
                                methods have been developed and tested on adults who are aware of and 
                                willing to let such experiments take place, then parents or doctors 
                                should not encourage experiments with creams on children.</P>
                              <P>Generally it seems from the reports which I have read, that IF a 
                                phimosis will stretch then it will do this without creams, creams may 
                                speed up the process.</P>
                              <P>I believe that if the ring wont stretch easily then a dorsal or 
                                a partial circ. are indicated; however some men are pretty determined 
                                to keep their foreskins entire and intact. So I will use the opportunity 
                                to find out a bit more about the nature of this simple bit of gristle. 
                                So we're investigating which creams soaps and cock-baths are efficient 
                                in regenerating non-elastic skin tissue ... and naturally also what 
                                causes it to degenerate in the first place. </P>

                              <P>Dave had LSA and was also attempting to combat this with stretching

                              <P>The vitamin E has helped more than anything else, previously, If 
                                I was retracted before an erection, the noose would be tight enough 
                                to be definitely uncomfortable, lately I believe it would be able to 
                                withstand the stress of an erection, but not any additional strain 
                                from friction or certain external forces.... There was a period before 
                                I started taking Vitamin E where a good erection would break the skin 
                                to a degree.</P>
                              <P>Oh yes. I was given an ointment when first diagnosed, I think it 
                                was hydrocortisone (I'll look at home if I still have the name somewhere). 
                                All this did was burst capillaries under the skin and made things worse. 
                                I think this is important so people avoid it.</P>

                              <P>I'd suggest a simple infusion like when you make camomile tea, ... 
                                I cant guarantee Camomile will be any use, BUT phimosis is basically 
                                a very simple ailment and I feel there must be a few very simple cures 
                                which as soon as a few people start experimenting it could profit future 
                                generations ... 
                              <P>From what I understand it would be logical if different creams worked 
                                with specific types of ring. </P>
                              <P>Recent letters indicate phimotic ring started after taking antibiotics, 
                                or after cortisone, so, be careful, chemicals can make things worse. </P>
                              <P>LSA is in my opinion an absolute indication for surgery, but as 
                                mentioned above, if adults wish to experiment, then its your own responsibility 
                                ... lets just get the experiments out in public on ARC

                                </B>This guy was diagnosed with Balanitis, his attempts with creams 
                                were unsuccessful, however his thoughts and experiments should not 
                                be ignored. </P>
                              <P>>I have realised that my foreskin has recently seemed dehydrated, 
                                was dry, and cracked with an erection. The tap water in my area is 
                                very alkaline, plus if I washed with soap, or shower gel, that could 
                                also increase the alkalinity of my skin. I have always felt that my 
                                skin was very tight after a shower, even on my face and hands, 
                              <P>&gt;I am using two products at the moment; 
                              <P>&gt;Garnier Nutralia "Dermo - Protection " <BR>
                                Soap Free & Moisturising gel, 2 in 1 for sensitive skin <BR>
                                Made by " Laboratoires Garnier " <BR>
                                I have the " Sport " version. 
                              <P>&gt;AND 
                              <P>&gt;Vaseline " Intensive Care " <BR>
                                Lipid Enriched Derma Care Fragrance Free Lotion <BR>
  "Effective Relief For Problem Dry Skin " 
                              <P>>I found a dermatologically approved moisturiser, which is free 
                                from perfume, and regularly apply it to my freshly cleansed foreskin 
                                and glans, while they are still very damp. 
                              <P>>It's good to wash the penis quickly after sex because it is stretched 
                                and the skin gets re hydrated and moisturised at full stretch, I get 
                                the thought that this is beneficial, it's just a sense that I have. 
                              <P>>Also a point is that I am drinking more water, this is an attempt 
                                to keep myself hydrated from the inside. 
                              <P>>also I've been considering if the pH levels of the woman are influential 
                                ?.....what is the pH level of her lubrication ? 
                              <P>>The doctor also said he believed I had balanitis, I think he said 
                                BXO ? not sure, but he said it was a skin disease that nobody understood 
                                yet, he also said that in time, the problem of an uncooperative foreskin 
                                might come back...and then circumcision might have to be considered. 
                              <P><I>later I received:</I><BR>
  >I AM NOT USING THE CREAMS MUCH, AFTER SPLITTING AGAIN RECENTLY (AFTER 
                                A LONG STINT OF NEAR NORMALITY) MY FORESKIN WENT BACK TO SQUARE ONE. 
                              <P>____________________________ 
                              <P>I feel as though the only way I will get further with a general 
                                theory is first to understand acids and alkalis. 
                              <P>The sort of question I'm considering is maybe showers only help 
                                stretching if the water is soft ... : Alkalis and Acids are a mystery 
                                to me, Ph (what does Ph mean?) - I remember blue litmus paper which 
                                turned red or red litmus which turned blue and I know that the average 
                                neutral alkali acid value is 7 on a scale of 14 ... and I believe soft 
                                and hard water are acid or alkali but which is soft and which is hard? 
                                and does this relate to chalk or clay in the basic soil in an area??? 
                                ... can anyone answer -- ? If alkali makes it tighter, why use Ph neutral 
                                soap, why not use a soap which is acid??? Is salt water acid or alkali? 
                              <P>_______________________</P>
                              <P> I am a 32 year-old uncircumcised male. My question concerns the 
                                so-called phimotic ring. At about age 11/12 I experienced what I remember 
                                to be a rather severe case of phimosis. Over some time I recall not 
                                being able to retract the foreskin. The opening was very small and 
                                I believe there was some discharge as well. Frustrated with the situation, 
                                I attempted to stretch the skin manually until it could be retracted. 
                                Eventually I remedied the condition by bathing in cold water and stretching. 
                              <P>&gt; Typically lichenoid rings start at puberty, yours must be a<BR>
  &gt; specific subcategory, because usually they dont stretch 
                              <P>Into my twenties I never experienced this situation again. While 
                                living in Germany I read that it was infact "unhealthy" to wash the 
                                foreskin using soap. It was recommended that water only be used. After 
                                I adopted this technique of hygiene I noticed a return of the tightness 
                                which was manifest in a white ring which is visible around the circumference 
                                of the shaft however it is more visible on the left side (there is 
                                a minute amount of scaring where the whiteness is most pronounced or 
                                thickest.). Although no trouble in retraction occured, the ring nonetheless 
                                was noticeable especially during erection (a white indentation rather 
                                than an hourglass was visible). Eventually it disappeared. More recently 
                                it has returned. Again it is not severe but a white ring is clearly 
                                visible during erection, especially on one side. I would like to eliminate 
                                this. I occasionally try stretching, in both directions with a vitamin 
                                e enriched cream, but with little success. 
                              <P> Is my complaint unique? Perhaps these annoyances have been one 
                                reason that routine circumcision has been perpetuated in various countries. 
                              <P> I have been using various essential oils (tea tree, lavender & 
                                camomile) over the last few weeks with, I believe, some success. I 
                                shall continue. I chose the tea tree and lavender because of their 
                                healing properties.

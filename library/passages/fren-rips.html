        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P>> Hi ... recently I ripped my frenulum breve when trying to <BR>
  >have sex with my girlfriend. I had noticed considerable discomfort 
                                before <BR>
  >this incicdent took place, but I just gave it time to heal before <BR>
  >participating in any more sexual encounters with my girlfriend. It 
                                would <BR>
  >often develop a white scab like surface over the irratated part and 
                                I would <BR>
  >often break it off when engaging in sex. This continued for several 
                                weeks <BR>
  >until now and I think I gradually wore my frenulum breve down and 
                                it ripped. <BR>
                              <P>Well you're describing a typical frenulum breve in all its wonderful 
                                confuion , and are remaining amazingly objective to the frustration 
                                this must have caused, ... (maybe one gets used to frustration like 
                                evrything else ... ) 
                              <P>>I'm going to see a doctor and I was wondering what precautions 
                                I could take <BR>
  >in preventing this from happening again without abstaining from sex 
                                because <BR>
  >that I think is a logical sacrifice that i couldn't live with. Thanks 
                              <P>you seem unaware of the frenuloplasty operation <BR>

                                I have occsioanlly heard of a scab or ulcer, sometimes very problematic, 
                                .. tell us if you find a cure.<BR>
                                good Luck<BR>

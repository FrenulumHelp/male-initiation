        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                            <P>I just came across your site. I have experienced much of what you 
                              write about. I am looking forward to reading more. I thought I was 
                              the only one with some of these issues. I am at work right now, so 
                              I will have to look into this further. Thanks</P>
                            <P>I am a 37 year old male with foreskin. I grew up in Minnesota and 
                              all other boys areound me were circumcised. Some of the things you 
                              write about I experience alone. I had no idea others had the same experiences.</P>
                            <P>I thought I would write some more. Like I said, I am uncircumcised 
                              and always felt different. I never really knew why I looked different 
                              until I was about 11 years old. I didn't know that I could pull my 
                              foreskin back until about that time. I thought I was born without a 
                              head on my penis. At a doctor visit the doctor exposed my glans for 
                              the first time. </P>
                            <P>The head of my penis has always been hard to touch, at first air 
                              even seemed to almost hurt. I have a short frenulum so when I am erect, 
                              the glans pull back at an angle. </P>
                            <P>-----------<BR>
                              There's a hell of a lot of us who just didn't know we had a glans, 
                              or didn't realise that it could be exposed. So a doctor exposed your 
                              glans ... ouch ... </P>
                            <P>> I have a short frenulum so when I am erect, the glans pull<BR>
  > back at an angle. </P>
                            <P>actually this only happens when you retract the foreskin otherwise 
                              the effect is that the foreskin is pulled forward ... penetration would 
                              be a little difficult .... relatively simple to get the frenulum fixed 
                              --- </P>
                            <P>----------<BR>
                              When I am erect, the skin only pulls back to just behind the glans, 
                              and if I am really hard, the glans pull back at an angle. Do you know 
                              what I mean? I also have a really pinkish purplish head. the slit has 
                              kind of reddish lips on it. I have noticed circumcised men don't have 
                              either. I think the head shape is different also, it is more tapered 
                              and slender, kind of pointed. I wasn't cut because I was sick when 
                              i was born. </P>
                            <P>My skin seems to be pretty thick also. I am not a very big person 
                              either, only I bet about 5.5 inches or 6 inches maybe. Soft I get really 
                              small, 2.5 inches. The head shape seems to be really more like an circular 
                              head than a mushroom head, there is not really a ridge that flares 
                              out. </P>
                            <P>I hope I can get some time to read more. I am very busy right now. 
                              I am interested in your thoughts. What percentage of men in England 
                              are circumcised?</P>
                            <P>I do have a kink when erect. The glans actually seem to pull back 
                              though. I went into the site again. I would like to connect with others 
                              with similare experiences. Do you know how I can do that? I really 
                              believe that not understanding why my penis was so different affected 
                              my own beliefs as what it is to be a man. Does that make sense? I think 
                              it really affected me. <BR>
                              Thanks, let me know</P>

                            <P>My coronal ridge started expanding within a month of the operation, </P>
                            <P>> I do have a kink when erect. </P>
                            <P>Are you sure, without pulling back on the foreskin or touching it 
                              in any way ... ? ... I wonder to what extent the frenulum is actually 
                              pulling the glans downwards, and if after an operation, this downward 
                              pull is at all corrected - I suspect the glans has formed with a kink 
                              due to the short frenulum ... i.e. after an op. there would be almost 
                              no change, ... have you got a camera? unfortunately I haven't so I 
                              was unable to take pics before and after the operation ... </P>
                            <P>> I really<BR>

                            <P>This is what my site is all about, my condition affected my masturbation 
                              and my relationship with myself, and with others, and thus ultimately 
                              influenced a good part of my life ... </P>
                            <P>I'm not resentfully complaining, it is one of life's experiences, 
                              but I do want to put this experience to good use .. not just waste 
                              it and forget it all ... <BR>

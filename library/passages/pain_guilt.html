        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P>When I first read about Phimosis on your website, I cried. <BR>
                                I am not circumsized and any sexual activity for me has been extremely 
                                painful. 
                              <P>I am 22 now and I never new what was wrong with my penis. In fact, 
                                I have been so turned off to sex that I've managed to stay a virgin 
                                all these years. <BR>
                                Whenever I get an erection, it is so uncomfortable that I don't even 
                                want to be sexual with my partners. </P>
                              <P>Sometimes urinating hurts. My erections don't last long and this 
                                has always affected my self-esteem. I would blame myself and feel sexually 
                                inadequete. </P>
                              <P>I'm happy now that there is a reason and a name for my condition. <BR>
                                Although I haven't seen a doctor yet, all of the symptoms for phimosis 
                                are present. </P>
                              <P>Thank you for your help.</P>

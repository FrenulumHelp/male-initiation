        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P>Hi Robin,<BR>
                                reading your German version of the phimose I just want to consult you: 
                                My bofriend (28) suffers from it - and me too. It is not too often, 
                                but every third time he can't come because of it. And the use of condoms 
                                is difficult, too. 
                              <P>He didn't have a proper girlfriend yet, so he is not used to regular 
                                sex anyway. I even had contact to a few men who were circumcised doing 
  "research" over the net about this problem I am so devastated that 
                                it gets worse with sexual contact! So from now on it must become more 
                                painful... 
                              <P>But he absolutely denies to get an operation. He is absolutely anxious. 
                                I am quite devastated because I feel so helpless. I really love him, 
                                and our emotional and rational understanding is phenomenal. As we are 
                                only together for a few months our sex life is not much developped 
                                yet, and I have a health problem too (the Crohn's disease with peri-anal 
                                complications). So I don't want to overcharge him. But after a certain 
                                time we have to face the problem. What is your recommendation?<BR>
                                Thanks a lot for your answer.<BR>
                                Yours 
                              <P>------------- 
                              <P>This is very tricky if he doesn&laquo;t want to have an operation ...<BR>
                              <P>use your love and your communication to get through the problems 
                                ... extreme anxiety ... what can I suggest ... it IS anxiety for the 
                                unknown and a bit of education may cure this ... maybe he imagines 
                                that a full circumcision is the only cure ... mostly a partial circumcision 
                                or even a dorsal slit will suffice ... but are you sure it is phimosis, 
                                it could be frenulum breve - please check this out 
                              <P>please could you read the english <BR>
                                  <A HREF="../../../../welcome.html#start">www.male-initiation.net</A><BR>
                                where you will find a summary of the conditions 
                              <P>you could also read<BR>
                                  <A HREF="../../phimosis_treatment.html#start">http://www.male-initiation.net/phimosis_treatment.html</A><BR>
                                get about half way down the page and then follow links for dorsal slit 
                                and partial circumcision - if you educate yourself it would be easier 
                                to educate him. 
                              <P>For extreme anxiety, I would consider a loving relationship better 
                                than any psychologist ... 
                              <P>sorry I have no potted answer<BR>
                                Good Luck<BR>

        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P> hello, <BR>
                                i found your site very informative, and i feel as if i can agree with 
                                you for i am not too open about any sexual problems i have and am not 
                                very keen on sharing it with my phsyician. 
                              <P>i am a 21 yr old male, who has just started to have sex recently 
                                (last 2months) for the first few times. i am not circumsized, and my 
                                partner is very tight, prior to me losing my virginity i would masturbate 
                                with my foreskin in place and the foreskin would not retract backwards 
                                during a proper erection, thus i would masturbate with the foreskin 
                                showing a little portion of the tip of my penis, and i would reach 
                                an orgasm in approx. 2-4 mins with no pain. i never thought of pulling 
                                the foreskin back for the pain was too much. 
                              <P>now that i have sex often i find that when i penetrate my partner 
                                the foreskin is forced back automatically & cause much pain & i have 
                                not reached an orgasm with my partner even though we have vigorous 
                                sex for 15 mins. thus the last few times i personally, manually removed 
                                the foreskin back myself, the last time i did this, we had sex for 
                                13 mins, and afterwards when i went to the washroom i noticed a tear 
                                in my foreskin and a considerable amount of patches of blood on my 
                                underwear. 
                              <P>the last few times i have been telling my partner i have reached 
                                an orgasm but i havent come close. could you please tell me what this 
                                condition is called? what are the solutions? the severity of this situation? 
                                is this foreskin condition the reason for me not attaining an orgasm 
                                during sex? 
                              <P>------------<BR>
                                A summary of my answer is that this is possibly frenulum breve and 
                                phimosis - the simplest solution for these combined conditions is not 
                                a full circumcision - it is a dorsal slit and simply dividing the frenulum.

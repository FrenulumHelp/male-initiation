        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                            <TD><P><B>ELASTIC BANDS and PHIMOTIC RINGS</B>
                              <P>Hi there everybody<BR>
                                Sorry I've been keeping so quiet lately, but I've been reading through 
                                the various comments on wearing the foreskin retracted, phimosis and 
                                adhesions with interest. 
                              <P>I've been giving some thought to the nature of the preputial ring, 
                                phimotic or otherwise. During the discussions on retracting the foreskin, 
                                someone suggested that a mild degree of phimosis may be necessary to 
                                keep the skin back behind the glans when flaccid. I do not agree with 
                                this view as it is merely the elastic nature of the skin, trying to 
                                return the preputial orifice to its 'natural' size, which holds it 
                                there. This elasticity will vary betwen individuals, and in some it 
                                may not be enough to hold the foreskin retracted, but it must exist 
                                otherwise eveyone's foreskin opening would be the same as the glans 
                                diameter, and would gape wide open when the foreskin was forward. 
                              <P>Thinking back to my own childhood, before my phimosis developed, 
                                my foreskin would stay back while flaccid, and I think most other boys' 
                                foreskins would. I would think that foreskins get looser with age, 
                                or with repeated retractions, so the adult is perhaps less likely to 
                                be able to stay permanently retracted. 
                              <P>These thoughts on foreskin elasticity got me thinking about balloons 
                                (the party type, not the hot air type). A balloon which has not been 
                                blown up before can be very difficult to blow up, but if it is then 
                                deflated it is much easier to blow up the second time, and becomes 
                                easier at each successive inflation. If foreskins behaved the same 
                                way, this could explain so-called 'childhood phimosis', where the skin 
                                is too tight to allow it to be pulled back without pain or discomfort. 
                                Repeated stretching, caused by erections and gentle manipulation, will 
                                gradually allow the skin to be stretched more easily and eventually 
                                allow retraction. 
                              <P>This analogy with balloons did not explain phimosis satisfactorily, 
                                but I then thought of something that might - an elastic band. 
                              <P>Any elastic band can have three physical characteristics described:<BR>
                                1. natural length<BR>
                                2. elasticity<BR>
                                3. maximum length 
                              <P>To explain these in a bit more detail:<BR>
                                1. natural length - fairly obvious, the length when no force is applied.<BR>
                                2. elasticity - the extension produced by a given force. One particular 
                                elastic band may double in length when a given force is applied, and 
                                another, more elastic one, may triple its length when the same force 
                                is applied.<BR>
                                3. maximum length - when stretching an elastic band, there comes a 
                                point where the resistance to further extension suddenly becomes very 
                                much greater, and a much greater force is required. Only a small amount 
                                of further extension is possible before the band breaks. 
                              <P>Now, how does this relate to foreskins, specifically the opening? 
                              <P>1. natural size - the size of the opening with the penis flaccid 
                                and the skin fully forward.<BR>
                                2. elasticity - the increase in size of opening produced by a given 
                                force.<BR>
                                3. maximum size - the size beyond which a much larger force is required 
                                to cause a further increase in size. Any further stretching will cause 
                                pain and/or damage to the tissue. 
                              <P>The concept of a maximum size of opening lends itself to a very 
                                neat definition of phimosis. That is, phimosis exists when the maximum 
                                size of the preputial orifice is less than the maximum diameter of 
                                the glans on erection. 
                              <P>My own phimosis was very severe, and the maximum size of the opening 
                                was not much more than its natural size. However, when pulling back 
                                on the skin, it felt very much as though it had reached a definite 
                                limit of extendibility, just like an elastic band. While on the subject 
                                of my own phimosis, Peter's description of his 'rounded triangle of 
                                gristly skin' fitted my own foreskin perfectly. I would say that the 
                                constriction was in the inner foreskin immediately behind the opening. 
                              <P>Would any other phimosis sufferers care to comment on this? 
                              <P>It would be interesting to debate how the three characteristics 
                                I have mentioned develop in time from childhood through to adulthood. 
                                My own hypothesis is that in most young boys, the natural size of the 
                                opening is small, and the elasticity is low (i.e. the foreskin is tight), 
                                and these two characteristics may prevent retraction. Now, as the boy 
                                grows, do the natural orifice size and elasticity increase of their 
                                own accord, or is some manual assistance required to do this, i.e regular 
                                retraction (or attempts at retraction)? Thinking of the balloon analogy, 
                                I am tempted to think that assistance is required. I am also reminded 
                                of &Oslash;ster, who found that retractibility increased with age, 
                                but was it his own previous attempts at retraction (and the boys' own 
                                subsequent attempts at retraction, having learnt that the skin should 
                                pull back) which resulted in the retractibility at a later age? 
                              <P>Does the maximum orifice size increase with age as the boy is growing? 
                                Does repeated retraction cause the maximum orifice size to increase? 
                                If we speculate that retraction *is* necessary to increase the maximum 
                                orifice size, we could have the situation where a boy's maximum orifice 
                                is sufficient to enable retraction before puberty, but would not be 
                                large enough to allow retraction over the enlarged glans after puberty. 
                                If he regularly retracts before puberty, this may increase the maximum 
                                size of the opening and prepare it for the larger expansion required 
                                after puberty. In other words, in some boys, if they do not retract, 
                                or attempt to retract, before puberty, they may find themselves suffering 
                                from phimosis after puberty, which would have been avoided if they 
                                had retracted from an earlier age. 
                              <P>This is all speculation of course, and the actual behaviour of the 
                                foreskin will be determined by the cellular structure of the skin (about 
                                which I know nothing), just as the characteristics of an elastic band 
                                are determined by its molecular structure. 
                              <P>Anyway, it's food for thought.<BR>

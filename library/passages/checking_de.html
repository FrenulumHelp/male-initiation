        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P>In Germany checking is laid down by the Ministry of Health ... I 
                                receive a number of letters from men (always from Germany) who found 
  &quot;checking&quot; to be an extremely confusing childhood experience. 
                                It will become clear that the doctors in Germany have no guide lines 
                                on how to check, what to check for, and what to do when they find any 
                                problem - It is somehow understood that every doctor obviously knows 
                                what to do with such simple problems. 
                              <P>Many German boys are operated around the age of 6 yrs. (presumably 
                                with a congenital phimosis which may have otherwise stretched, - on 
                                the other hand forceful stretching exercises are still sometimes recommended 
                                (in 1999) - in comparison with which circumcision seems a relatively 
                                appropriate treatment). </P>

                              <P>The following story was written emotionally, it shows that it was 
                                certainly felt in a traumatic way by the man concerned.</P>
                              <P>&quot;Later, my mother took me to the paediatrician and I had one 
                                of the most painful experiences of my life. The doctor sat me down 
                                on the examination table and examined my little penis and its immobile 
                                foreskin. He then called for 2 nurses who held me down by force as 
                                the doctor attempted to brutally stretch the opening in my foreskin. 
                                The worst moment was when he used a scalpel to make a little incision 
                                in my frenulum. No anaesthetic was used...&quot;</P>
                              <P>&quot;The doctor told my mother that my foreskin would have to be 
                                retracted and stretched daily but after a few days my mother gave up 
                                because I couldn't bear the pain and kept on crying. So, any treatment 
                                was forgotten and I continued to grow up with my phimosis.&quot;</P>

                                I am certain, that it is only the rarest of practical doctors who would 
                                thoughtlessly conduct such a sudden shock exposure of this important 
                                part of a child's future manhood, however it is clear from a reports 
                                between 1997 - 1999 that such methods are still being practiced by 
                                a few isolated doctors.</P>

                              <P>Subject: To the Topic Examination of the Boy's Foreskin</P>
                              <P>Hallo.<BR>
                                I want to give you a short report of experiences with the prepuce from 
                                my point of view.</P>
                              <P>My foreskin was examined at the age of two. The doctor tried to 
                                retract it and to solve the heavy adhesions between my foreskin and 
                                my glans. This had not much success because my foreskin was still quite 
                                tight and cannot be seen as a phimosis but as something very natural. 
                                The adhesions came back again and again because pulling back my prepuce 
                                was only possible by using real force. The pains I suffered by the 
                                doctor who was trying to retract my foreskin were very extreme, I remember 
                                especially one occasion when I was five years old. At this point he 
                                suggested a circumcision but wanted to retry it once more, I myself 
                                was never asked, but I am sure that if anyone had told me at that time, 
                                that a circumcision would make an end to the torturing pains of solving 
                                the adhesions, I would have agreed in cutting off my foreskin.</P>
                              <P>Later I was examined by another doctor, who was a woman. We changed 
                                the doctor because we had to move to another city. She only tried to 
                                pull it back as far as it would go - 50 % at that time (I was 6 yrs. 
                                old) . I was surprised that she was satisfied with that, but she said 
                                she only wanted to see if the ring of the prepuce would be big enough. 
                                I was once more examined by her because of a problem with the urethra 
                                and she pulled back my foreskin again to see if I had balanitis - she 
                                said, then she would have suggested circumcision (at 7 years). The 
                                school doctor also pulled back my foreskin at that time and it could 
                                be retracted to almost two thirds, which was for her not enough. She 
                                said that a schoolboy must be able to retract his foreskin completely 
                                and if not, then immediate circumcision was the only choice because 
                                the adhesions could not be solved anymore, they had grown to skin bridges 
                                between foreskin and glans.</P>
                              <P>So I got a date to be circumcised in the town hospital. But we still 
                                had to wait one year for the operation, because there was only one 
                                surgeon to cut the foreskins off and the school doctors sent at that 
                                time (1985) almost 50% to the circumcision. By this time we had moved 
                                to another town. At our new town we went after some time to a pediatrician, 
                                who examined my foreskin which had almost no adhesions anymore (with 
                                9 years) and he said that he wouldn't cut the foreskin off.</P>
                              <P>So I remained uncircumcised but I really don't feel happier about 
                                that fact. I did suffer a lot under the state of the medical doctors 
                                who had no real idea of what to do with my foreskin. ...</P>
                              <P>Maybe you can understand why I think a little bit critical about 
                                your idea of the early examination which could prevent all prepuce 
                                problems: I think early examination yes but not before 5 years and 
                                if phimosis or strong adhesions then better circumcise immediately 
                                than waiting and causing a lot of pain and shame to the boy.</P>

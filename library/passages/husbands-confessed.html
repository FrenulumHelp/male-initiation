        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                            <TD><P><B>HUSBAND`S CONFESSION</B>
                              <P>My husband is British (thus uncircumcised) and we first started 
                                dating when I lived in Britain about 11 years ago. At the time, he 
                                was very reluctant to have sex and I couldn't figure out what was wrong.</P>
                              <P>After a year he finally 'fessed up that he had a problem with his 
                                foreskin being too tight and that sex was very painful for him. After 
                                much embarrassment, he finally went to a doctor about it and a few 
                                months later was checked into a hospital and circumcised under anesthetic 
                                (sp?). He went through months of excrutiating pain at the time. He 
                                also learned from friends and his own father that several of them had 
                                experienced some medical problems as children and young adults and 
                                as a result had to go through the same extremely painful procedure 
                                at some time in their lives.</P>
                              <P>As a result, he would rather have his son circumcised at birth than 
                                possibly suffer the same pain he did later on in life.</P>
                              <P>And as all of this transpired in Britain, I find it rather difficult 
                                to believe that they would consider banning circumcision. If they are, 
                                they are crazy because they must be aware how many British men end 
                                up drawing on the NHS as adults for a procedure that could have been 
                                performed at much less cost and suffering when they were infants.</P>

                                Such subjective feelings develop very frequently, -- why circumcise 
                                or nothing? why these routine questions and answers? surely it would 
                                be sensible to check kids and if they need treatment then this can 
                                be individual.

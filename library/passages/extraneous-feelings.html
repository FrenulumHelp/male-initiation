        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P>Dear R. Stuart,<BR>
                                Yesterday I read your essay. It concerned me because I had this problem 
                                but I have never thought that it could be affecting my behavior in 
                                some way. I am sure that my sexual behavior is not normal. I have entered 
                                adulthood with this restriction and now the idea persist.</P>
                              <P>I am 26. When I was child I did not realize this problem. When I 
                                was a teenager I realized it. I saw that I was different from my friends. 
                                I felt embarassed when I was in the bathroom with my classmates. Also, 
                                I couldn't masturbate easily. I needed to be very careful and often 
                                I did not get orgasm. I knew that I could not have sex. I did not have 
                                a relationship because if I had a preposition I could have intercourse.</P>
                              <P>I decided to go to the urologists at 22. I had the foreskin that 
                                sticked all my glans. After the operation I was "normal" but until 
                                now I feel extraneous.</P>
                              <P>I have never had sex with a woman. I had sex with my cousin when 
                                I was 10-12 years old. It was like a play. After that, I had it with 
                                my neighbor (13-15) I think it was more seriously. I was only passive.</P>
                              <P>Although I do not have sex with guys now, I feel I am homosexual. 
                                I have tried to explain this behavior and my own answer was the former 
                                relation with my cousin. I tried to have girlfriend but I do not why 
                                I couldn't. Now, I think that being an uncircumcised male played an 
                                important role.</P>
                              <P>I have wanted to go several times to the psychologist but I feel 
                                embarazed to talk about it. In my country this sexual preference is 
                                abnormal (I mean, be homosexual).</P>
                              <P>Mr. Stuart, I am willing to give you more information each time 
                                it wil be able help other persons like me. I am sure that my identidy 
                                will be threated in a confidential way.</P>
                              <P>Regards,</P>
                              <P>Note : I apalogize for the Englis, it is not my native language.</P>
                              <P>-------------------------------<BR>
                                at a guess you're Spanish ... or Italien ... and I hope not too much 
                                disappointment but I'm not a doctor ... I answer to Robin or Bob or 
                                even Stuart </P>
                              <P>>After the operation I was "normal" but until now I feel extraneous.</P>
                              <P>In English we cant actually say we feel extraneous, ... but being 
                                a foreigner in Germany I have often an unpleasant experience which 
                                one could call extraneous ... so perhaps this is exactly what you mean 
                                ... !! </P>
                              <P>>I decided to go to the urologist at 22. I had a foreskin that sticked 
                                all my glans. </P>
                              <P>So you had late infant adhesions ... very painful for masturbation 
                                you could only rub lightly or apply pressure to the phallus when masturbating 
                                ... penetration would be pretty impossible ..</P>
                              <P>Psychologists in my experience have no idea on anatomically based 
                                sexual problems</P>
                              <P>I dont know if maybe you are homosexual by nature ... I am sure 
                                the painful foreskin throughout puberty development would have some 
                                inhibitive sexual effects ... what exactly, ?? maybe they just make 
                                any already existing influence more extreme ... </P>
                              <P>(.. <I>Invitations followed to join ARC etc. </I>.. ) 
                              <P>Cheers Robin</P>

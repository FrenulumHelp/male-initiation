        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                            <TD><P><B>CHILD`S INFECTION and AN ANTI-CIRC DOCTOR</B>
                              <P>My 3 year old son who is uncircumcised began complaining when urinating, 
                                the second day I noticed swelling and called his doctor. We were told 
                                by his doctor that he had an infection under the foreskin and he was 
                                given 2 days of Septra antibiotics. We have since found that his foreskin 
                                is difficult to retract (I had never tried before). When we attempt 
                                to pull it back the skin cracks just as the tip of the glans begins 
                                to protrude. I managed to get it back once without cracking the skin, 
                                but he complained of pain and it squeezed the tip of his penis and 
                                it began to turn blue so I quickly pulled it back down. After 1 month 
                                we have seen no improvement or loosening of the skin. His doctor says 
                                that he does not need to be circumcised and he will probably grow out 
                                of it. I don't know what to do should he see some kind of specialist?? 
                              <P>I must say, I have several reports from grown men, who have very 
                                disturbing memories as a result of such childhood experiments with 
                                creams, and stretching exercises, ... 
                              <P>There is great confusion caused by the anti circumcision and pro 
                                circumcision groups, --- some doctors circumcise everything, others 
                                nothing, this "routine" thinking in terms of two extremes seems more 
                                based in personal experience and bias rather than anything which considers 
                                individual cases. 
                              <P>In my opinion an individual case related approach shows some cases 
                                need circumcision others dont, and your son needs an operation, either 
                                a full or a partial circumcision would be advisable. 
                              <P>please at least go for a second opinion, and drop me a line if in 
                                doubt, 
                              <P>between the foreskin and glans is ideal - heating dark, moist,- 
                                for fungal growths, once they've started they are very hard to cure 
                                and often leave a phimotic scar, which will need a partial circumcision 
                                anyway - circumcision will dry out the area partial circumcision is 
                                the only alternative, but then trying to get a 3 yr. old to wear his 
                                foreskin retracted (to dry out the area) may well be a problem ...<BR>
                                good luck<BR>

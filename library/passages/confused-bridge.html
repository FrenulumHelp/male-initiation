        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P>Growing up I always noticed that my penis seemed different from 
                                those of others. I was always lost and confused why mine was so different. 
                                Then, I read your webpages. And it opened my eyes to what was going 
                                on. I have what you reffered to as skin bridges. One small one on the 
                                right side and one larger one on the left. Connected to the top of 
                                my Glans. I am 20 yrs old and having one incident where i was made 
                                fun of, really affected the way I think of it. I was wondering if there 
                                was anything I can do to correct those and get rid of them in the privacy 
                                of my own home. Or what is the procedure when you have them? Please 
                                get back to me soon. I really appreciate any help you can offer. </P>
                              <P>Skin bridges are probably the easiest condition to correct, and 
                                it is well worth doing.</P>
                              <P> really and truly, with this condition I have never heard of any 
                                complications, a surgeon ... probably any normal doctor could perform 
                                the operation ... an urologist, particularly some of the older urologists, 
                                are perhaps more sympathetic to such conditions.</P>
                              <P>Write me how it goes,<BR>
                                good luck<BR>

        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                            <TD><P>Hello Robin,<BR>
The most important think at first. 
                              <P>I've changed my status, and at this moment I'm sitting in front 
                                of my computer and feel a little discomfort in my trousers. 
                              <P>And that's because a was circumcised three days ago! Yes, it's true. 
                                I still cannot believe it but I've done it. 
                              <P>It looks very bad, just like a ICE from the Deutsche Bahn AG rolled 
                                over it. But the medical doctors told me to relax, in one or two weeks 
                                I should be able to recognize my penis again ;-) 
                              <P>I started to write a diary and I'm sending you the first parts (I've 
                                wrote them for the "circlist") (An american friend of mine helped me 
                                to write that, so don't wonder why this and the following text sound 
                                so different - I think my english is worse than your german)<BR>
                                That's all for today, 
                              <P>Tschuess<BR>
                                _____________ 
                              <P>"2 days before"<BR>
                                Dear Circlisters, 
                              <P>Just two more days to go. Thursday is nearing and so the day of 
                                my circumcision. I've been getting really nervous these past few days. 
                                On one side I'm really looking forward to finally getting my dire wishes 
                                fulfilled. One the other hand I'm VERY worried about the actual procedure 
                                (pain?) and also the final outcome. 
                              <P>As promised I will keep you all informed about my plans and progress. 
                                Let me briefly recap a bit of my own personal history concerning my 
                                decision to become circumcised. 
                              <P>As stated here many times, it is very uncommon for Germans to be 
                                circumcised. When I was born in the 60s, my parents left me intact. 
                                In infancy it is normal that the foreskin remains unretractable. Any 
                                adhesions usually don't loosen until the age of 2-3. As I entered elementary 
                                school at the age of 5, the school physician found that my foreskin 
                                was still unretractable. 
                              <P><A NAME="check"></A>Later, my mother took me to the pediatrician 
                                and I had one of the most painful experiences of my life. The doctor 
                                sat me down on the examination table and examined my little penis and 
                                its immobile foreskin. He then called for 2 nurses which held me down 
                                by force as the doctor attempted to brutally stretch the opening in 
                                my foreskin. The worst moment was when he used a scalpel to make a 
                                little incision in my frenulum. No anaesthetic was used and as you 
                                can imagine the pain that little Albert had to endure was immense. 
                              <P>The doctor told my mother that my foreskin would have to be retracted 
                                and stretched daily but after a few days my mother gave up because 
                                I couldn't bear the pain and kept on crying. So, any treatment was 
                                forgotten and I continued to grow up with my phimosis. 
                              <P>During puberty I noticed that my foreskin remained unretractable, 
                                but in its flaccid state I looked just like the other boys in my class. 
                              <P>By the time I was 17 and had my medical exam for military service, 
                                I was once again reminded of my condition and that something needed 
                                to be done to remedy the situation. Over the years I had developed 
                                a certain 'inferiority complex' because I was unable to retract my 
                                foreskin like healthy men could. BTW, I never had a problem masturbating 
                                or with infections. However, I had decided that it was time to take 
                                steps to fix the problem. 
                              <P>So, I finally decided, with great despair, to go visit a urologist. 
                                He recommended to fix my phimosis in the hospital on an outpatient 
                                basis. Right before entering the operating room I saw my name on the 
                                board, along with the word 'circumcision'. Of course I had educated 
                                myself beforehand about the subject and knew what that word meant. 
                                The best one of these book specifically warned against a complete circumcision 
                                in the case of phimosis. It said that the sensitivity of the glans 
                                would be reduced significantly by such a procedure and of course I 
                                did not want that to happen to me (interesting, especially since I 
                                had never seen or directly felt my glans ;-). 
                              <P>I discussed this with the attending surgeons, but, at first, they 
                                insisted that only a complete circumcision would cure me and that if 
                                anything less was performed I would be back in less than a year to 
                                have it fixed again. But I was insistent and so the surgeon removed 
                                only the skin at the tip of the foreskin, just enough to allow me to 
                                retract the foreskin easily. The first few days after the operation 
                                were uncomfortable but after a few days it was really interesting to 
                                be able to retract my foreskin for the first time and see my own glans. 
                              <P>The next few years went by without the predicted need for a recircumcision. 
                                When flaccid my penis looked just like any other uncut penis, but when 
                                erect, the circumcision scar was visible (but then again, it is difficult 
                                to tell if someone is circumcised or not when erect). 
                              <P>Over the past few years I started asking myself if my initial decision 
                                was correct (i.e. NOT to be completely circumcised) and I felt like 
                                I was the most loosely circumcised man in the world. During masturbation 
                                and sex I found that it felt better to hold my foreskin tightly back, 
                                simply because it was more stimulating and made me feel much better. 
                                This is the reason that I developed a profound interest in the subject 
                                of circumcision and eventually joined CIRCLIST. 
                              <P>After years of I-wish-I would-but-never-had-the-guts-to-do-it, I 
                                finally decided to bite the bullet and have the procedure done. 
                              <P>Now, with 48 hours to go (and counting), it's like a upcoming visit 
                                to the dentist: no matter how great the pain, at the time of the actual 
                                visit the pain is gone. I have never appreciated my foreskin as much 
                                as I have over the past few days. But, of course, cancellation is not 
                                an option, as I would probably regret it next week. 
                              <P>At this point I would like to thank everyone who has written to 
                                me in support! Even though I was a bit disappointed that only 5 people 
                                have answered David's call to send me encouraging notes. 
                              <P>Those who have been following my personal history can perhaps understand 
                                why I am a little scared (or is that 'scarred' ;-). Keep your fingers 
                                crossed for me on Thursday. If all goes well, I will try to continue 
                                my circumcision diary soon. 
                              <P>-------------<BR>
                                2 days after 
                              <P>Since March 6th I have finally changed my circumcision status!!! 
                              <P>As you can imagine I'm not feeling too great yet, but I will try 
                                to give a brief description of my experience: 
                              <P>As stated earlier, the operation was performed under general anethesia. 
                                During the pre-op consultation, I discussed with the doctor exactly 
                                where to place the circumcision scar and how much skin to remove. I 
                                also ensured that the frenulum would be completely removed. 
                              <P>Unfortunately, I cannnot yet verify whether my wishes were actually 
                                followed exactly, since I'm still wearing my initial bandage. To anyone 
                                wishing to be circumcised, be prepared for a pretty ugly post-operative 
                                look. My penis is looking pretty bad right now. There is a lot (a lot 
                                lot!!) of swelling and discoloration ranging from black to purple all 
                                over. This is probably due to the fact that a freehand circumcision 
                                was performed as opposed to using a Gomco or Plastibell. But I can 
                                only recommend the freehand technique to anyone, since the surgeon 
                                can much more easily follow the exact wishes of the patient. 
                              <P>According to the surgeon, one of the operating room nurses made 
                                a remark about using the huge amount of foreskin removed to fashion 
                                a leather wallet :-). 
                              <P>Contrary to my earlier fears, there is very little post-operative 
                                pain (except for occasional erections). The only uncomfortable thing 
                                is that the area around the removed frenulum is still oozing and bleeding 
                                slightly. The doctor said that this is normal and probably due to the 
                                lymphatic system readjusting to the new situation. I just have to constantly 
                                remind myself that the wound is only 48 hrs old and I hope (!) that 
                                my penis will not look like this forever. The initial bandage will 
                                come off later this evening and I'm looking forward to seeing a bit 
                                more detail then.

        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P>I am very unhappy that I was circumcised severely as an infant. 
                                This may not be my number one personal problem, but the fact that I 
                                am 5 months into a foreskin restoration project that I expect to take 
                                3 years, indicates that it does have some import in my life. For those 
                                unaware, I would like to detail the negative effects I have seen personally. </P>
                              <P>It is my thought that this would be a better technique to convince 
                                people that neo-natal circumcision should not be performed than the 
                                horrible thread going through so many news groups lately. Maybe if 
                                I had not been so severely circumcised, I too like many men, would 
                                wonder what the problem is, but I'm afraid that the problems I document 
                                below are all too common. Given that the benefits of circumcision are 
                                so highly debatable that we don't really know if there are any true 
                                benefits, then I have to come squarely down on the side against neo-natal 
                                circumcision. It would be a joy to care for my foreskin, I don't think 
                                even ridding me of any hygiene "problem" is a benefit. The cancer angles 
                                have not been scientifically proven with a strict control group. And 
                                it is difficult to perform a correct circumcision, which I would define 
                                as one giving just those non-existing "benefits", and NOT causing all 
                                these problems on an infant penis, which is too small, and not fully 
                                grown, especially not through puberty. Maybe you are thinking that 
                                just cutting a little off, or just a tiny piece, will make things better, 
                                but until I see scientific studies proving what each of these types 
                                of circumcision do to or for the person years later, I will remain 
                                steadfastly against it. How do you know you will see what you believe 
                                are "benefits" if you don't cut enough? What IS the correct amount 
                                of skin to cut off?</P>
                              <P>Negative effects of my circumcision: </P>
                              <P>1) I had a skin bridge, a condition in which the circumcision incision 
                                bonds in places with the corona of the glans during the healing process. 
                                This causes the skin to be even tighter in those places, and covers 
                                up part of the penis where stimulation is the most pleasurable. Finally, 
                                7 or 8 years ago, after contemplating it for years, I cut through the 
                                skin bridge myself. I would have done it much sooner, if I had understood 
                                what it was, and that there were no significant veins or nerves to 
                                be cut. This was significant trauma throughout my life, wondering why 
                                I had this extra hole in my penis, and how it got there. What I wanted 
                                then was a penis that at least looked like a "normal" circumcised penis. 
                                However, I was left with an external pucker midway down the shaft, 
                                at least the glans looks "normal". It's important to not feel like 
                                part of your body is disfigured, although I still feel terribly disfigured 
                                by the rest of the circumcision.</P>
                              <P>2) I was circumcised too tightly. There are several effects that 
                                this has. </P>
                              <P> a) Intercourse can be painful. Without lots of lubrication, it 
                                has always been too painful for me. Some women, my wife in fact, do 
                                not fully appreciate this, and may urge me to enter, and I have found 
                                that the anxiety produced by expecting pain, immediately ends the possibility 
                                of intercourse. Even explaining this ahead of time isn't completely 
                                sufficient, as in the heat of the moment, sometimes she forgets. </P>
                              <P> b) Sex, whether intercourse, self-masturbation, or masturbation 
                                by a partner, is not as pleasurable. Some circumcised men retain some 
                                movement of the skin during an erection, I did not. In fact, I was 
                                so tightly circumcised, that I wasn't aware that it was even normal 
                                for the skin to be able to move. When you can't move the skin, the 
                                only stimulation possible, is rubbing skin against skin. The underlying 
                                shaft can only get stimulation indirectly, instead of directly from 
                                moving the skin. Plus, rubbing skin against skin is hampered by friction, 
                                causing heat, dryness, chafing, and soreness. In fact, I have not found 
                                it possible ever to masturbate or have intercourse without lubrication. 
                                Using lubrication may be enjoyable even for an uncircumcised man, but 
                                being forced to use it, having to search for the best type and the 
                                correct amount, and having to deal with the extra mess and inconvenience, 
                                is not pleasurable. Also, prolonged stimulation, whether by masturbation 
                                or intercourse, even with lubrication, can cause problems. It even 
                                can cause problems for a partner. As women age and get closer to menopause, 
                                my understanding and experience is that less lubrication is produced. 
                                That means more friction through rubbing, more pain, or more artificial 
                                lubrication, with all of its inconvenience. I would think that women 
                                would NOT want men circumcised. It only adds to the abrasion in the 
                                vagina, which is fine while the lubrication lasts, but not as good 
                                and not natural. </P>
                              <P> c) My penis was always pulled in closer to the body, appearing 
                                smaller. This is significant, especially during adolescence in places 
                                like the gym class showers. It even affects how you feel about yourself 
                                in relation to other men. Living with such a shortened penis isn't 
                                as pleasurable, either, because it won't stay where you put it in underwear. 
                                If I were to put it down, the tight skin pulled it up at the first 
                                opportunity, and it would stick straight out. Wearing boxer shorts 
                                doesn't seem to be as comfortable in this condition, either. In any 
                                case, it takes a lot of work to overcome the feelings of inferiority 
                                of a smaller than average flaccid penis. </P>
                              <P>3) There is all the mystery, shame, and embarrassment caused by 
                                circumcision. Parents don't in my experience sit their boys down and 
                                explain what was done to them, and why. They have to learn it essentially 
                                in the streets, or in religious classes where circumcision is talked 
                                about. Even then, it is not easy to understand what was done to you. 
                                I could never figure out where the skin covering the glans came from 
                                before it was cut off. All of this is what I believe generates the 
                                cruelty that circumcised boys often deal out to the minority uncircumcised 
                                boys. Without being taught what it is, and what is was for, they have 
                                to find a way to feel good about themselves, and being better than 
                                an uncircumcised boy helps. So not only are the victims of circumcision 
                                affected, so are those who were not circumcised. What a sad way for 
                                an advanced society to operate! </P>
                              <P>4) There are many things I do not even know I am missing. For instance, 
                                the sensitivity of the glans and mucous tissue is most likely reduced. 
                                I am beginning to know what it is like to have some mobility of the 
                                shaft skin, but just barely. In my restoration program, I am most pleased 
                                with the little bit of gliding mechanism I have achieved. During intercourse 
                                I can now move in and out without the outside circle of skin having 
                                to move against the vagina. How much more comfort and pleasure can 
                                be realized by having enough skin for it to stroke the glans during 
                                intercourse? That I don't know yet, but I am eager to find out. Unfortunately, 
                                I will be missing my frenulum, as well, and I will never completely 
                                know how pleasurable my complete foreskin would have been. </P>
                              <P>Summary: There are too many problems with neo-natal circumcision 
                                for no proven benefits. Maybe some people were lucky enough to get 
                                a perfect circumcision, but I as well as many other men were not. For 
                                these and many reasons, neo-natal circumcision should not be performed. 
                                I would like to add here, that I have read victims' accounts of having 
                                been circumcised as a "punishment" for masturbation. This, and any 
                                other circumcision against the victims' will must be stopped. It is 
                                simply NOT acceptable. </P>
                              <P>For parents having their baby boys circumcised, I ask what kind 
                                of circumcision is he likely to get? Some of you know, but I expect 
                                that most do not. Why would you risk a poor job for so little benefit 
                                if any? I also think that if you ARE going to have your baby boy circumcised, 
                                that you OWE it to him to explain it to him, and be prepared to justify 
                                it. I don't think this should wait until the boy asks, either, as that 
                                is a difficult task, and the boy may already being feeling negative 
                                effects if only psychological, without you knowing it. </P>
                              <P>For those of us circumcised that either have difficulties with it, 
                                or simply wish that it had not been done, it's time to step up and 
                                let yourself be heard. Let's tell the community the pain, humiliation, 
                                embarrassment, anger, shock, guilt, inadequacy, resentment and grief 
                                that this needless neo-natal circumcision causes. If you happen to 
                                be very pleased with your neo-natal circumcision, maybe you were lucky, 
                                maybe you don't know what you are missing, or maybe your point of view 
                                has been affected by it. But those of us who ARE suffering should speak 
                                up. Otherwise, you are responsible for allowing it to continue.</P>
                              <P>This is my point of view. Anyone who wants to argue with me, good 
                                luck. I am certainly willing to listen to corrections I could make, 
                                ideas on how I could have stated this better given my sincere feelings 
                                on it, and I may entertain recanting part of it if need be. But I am 
                                against circumcision before the age of consent, especially neo-natal 
                                circumcision. And certainly, anyone with questions or needing clarifications

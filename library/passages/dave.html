        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                                I now know of several cases where boys have passed through puberty,<BR>
                                and reached the state of manhood with undiagnosed problems.<BR>
                                Including a man who discovered he was unable to have sex on his<BR>
                                wedding night because of phimosis. <BR>
  <BR>
                                Undoubtedly this is an extreme case, but underlies that point that<BR>
                                both men and boys can - over time, adapt their beliefs and thinking<BR>
                                patterns to accommodate their anatomical conditions.<BR>
  <BR>
                                Psychological problems are real, and not as rare as might be believed.<BR>
  <BR>
                                For myself, I reached the age of 26 with undiagnosed phimosis. At<BR>
                                this time I was suffering deep emotional scarring from the discovery<BR>
                                that I made at the age of 15.<BR>
  <BR>
                                The inability to retract my foreskin led me to make incorrect<BR>
                                assumptions about myself, including the idea that I was never meant 
                                to<BR>
                                have sex.<BR>
  <BR>
                                The lack of information available to me, assisted in the physical and<BR>
                                psychological trauma that I suffered from for many years.<BR>
  <BR>
                                I suspect that many boys and men are ignorant of their own bodies.<BR>
  <BR>
                                Perhaps only an increase in awareness, and the ability to talk openly<BR>
                                and freely will cure many of these problems.<BR>

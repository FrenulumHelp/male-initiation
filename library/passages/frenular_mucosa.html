        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P>To Robin Stuart <BR>
                                Arc U.K. <BR>
  <BR>
                                Dear Robin , 
                              <P>Back the other day I paid a visit to an urologist here in T&uuml;bingen 
                                due to dyspareunia i.e. pain during intercourse. I'm in my early thirties 
                                and I sometimes "suffer" from a milder form of frenulum breve, a condition 
                                that has only recently been dutifully recognized by urologists and 
                                is still very far from being completely understood. At least that was 
                                the impression I got from the urologist I visited, who revealed poor 
                                knowledge when he proposed to abblate the frenulum i.e. he proposed 
                                a frenectomy. </P>
                              <P>Being a cautious person by nature and also someone very familiar 
                                with medical issues I told the doctor I had to think about it. In fact 
                                being a biochemist, who had taken human anatomy, human physiology, 
                                neurobiology and histology during his training, and presently a researcher 
                                in the field of neurobiology and electrophysiology, I knew of course 
                                what that "minor" surgical intervention would most certanly imply. 
                                On top of it I'm male and thus "not being completely deprived" of my 
                                senses and sensitivity during intercourse or masturbation, I know what 
                                the frenulum means in terms of erogenous areas. </P>
                              <P>What was probably a minor problem, if at all, for the urologist 
                                I consulted, was a major concern for me. I started to wonder about 
                                how many of those urologists performing that kind of microsurgery would 
                                in fact be aware of what they were really doing, possibly destroying 
                                or excising a lot of "precious" mechanoreceptors, nerve-fascicles and 
                                blood vessels. </P>
                              <P>I started my quest for more information in the University's Medical 
                                library and came upon important articles such as those by Dr. C. Cold 
                                and Dr. Taylor on the prepuce and its function and sensitivity. Unfortunatelly 
                                I could find only very little information concerning the frenulum and 
                                even less on the condition of frenulum breve. Several books on Urology 
                                and Andrology refer to this condition but don't know how to make a 
                                correct diagnose nor what the surgical correction may be. Some books 
                                - even new books from the nineties still advance the idea of a circumcision 
                                as the only available and correct surgical intervention which I needless 
                                to say find very unfortunate. I found one single article on the technique 
                                of Z-plasty. </P>
                              <P>A further quest for more information through the internet led me 
                                to your homepage and all that enormous collection of information about 
                                frenulum breve. I think urologist - and of course myself also - would 
                                really have to congratulate you and thank you for the excellent job 
                                you did and you are still doing. In a letter to the German Chamber 
                                of Urologists asking them for more information on my condition, I referred 
                                your homepage to them ! Until now I haven't had any reply from them, 
                                but I had an e-mail from an acquaintance of mine - an urologist - to 
                                whom I wrote asking several things about frenulum breve and its correction. 
                                I'm enclosing his letter below. Unfortunatelly it is in German but 
                                I hope you'll be able to understand most of it. </P>
                              <P>Since you stated that cases of frenulum breve were of major interest 
                                to you I will take the time to give you a complete discription of my 
                                condition and the observations I made. My frenulum is attached to the 
                                ventral part of the glans approximately 0,2 in from the meatus ventral 
                                end. The first part of the frenulum, i.e. the first 0,5 in downwards 
                                from the point where it is attached to the glans, is membranous, quite 
                                thin in fact, and whitish. If one carefully pulls at the most distal 
                                point it unfolds forming a nearly equilateral triangle under the corona 
                                i.e. vertical to the penis shaft. One side of the triangle is attached 
                                to the basis of the corona, the other to the prepuce mucosa, and the 
                                third side is the unattached one, the frenulum central ridge so to 
                                speak. In fact it seems to be a bit thicker, cordy like and presents 
                                itself like a white hem. In this unfolded, rather translucent triangle 
                                there are some visible tiny blood vessels running parallel to the penis 
                                shaft but much of it is empty membranous area. I suppose this triangle 
                                is actually the part of the frenulum which rips or is suppose to rip 
                                during the first months of intercourse but then again to what cost. 
                                Since it rips under a 90&deg; to the penis shaft those few blood vessels 
                                I mentioned are torn apart and maybe also some important nerve fascicles. </P>
                              <P>Unfortunately I wasn't able to access the true sensitivity of this 
                                part of the frenulum, but from what I felt it does seem to respond 
                                to stimulation. As for the rest of the frenulum - ca. 0,4 in - it blends 
                                like a spreading root into the ridged band of the prepuce, forcing 
                                the folded prepuce to a certain obliquacity. In the flaccid state I 
                                can retract my prepuce completely but my frenum is under a lot of tension 
                                and forces my glans to take a ventral bent of about 50&deg;. This is not 
                                the the bent of 90&deg; which according to what I read is a bona fide indicative 
                                of frenulum breve, but all the same. In the erect state it is possible 
                                for me to partially withdraw the prepuce along the penis that is past 
                                the corona (ca. 3 cm) but with the hold from my fingers the prepuce 
                                - due to the tense built upon the frenulum - recedes up to the corona 
                                forming a ridged band of about 0,5 inch. None the less there is a gap 
                                of unpleated prepuce of ca. 0,2 in between the corona and the ridged 
                                band. Having attained the position the frenulum is no longer under 
                                tension. Since I have read about rippings of the frenulum and mine 
                                never did along several years of intercourse I think it must be quite 
                                a thick frenulum but then again I have no means of comparison and from 
                                my research in the literature I suppose no one probably has ?!!! Just 
                                for the record : I definitely don't suffer from phimosis since there 
                                is no difficulty in getting the prepuce to cover the glans even during 
                                full erection. </P>
                              <P>R.S. I believe your prominent frenular ridge is what has hindered 
                                the ripping, if this tough sinewy hem ripped or was cut, the translucent 
                                triangle (how poetic) would rip easily, -- I remember particularly 
                                Peter S. in his document describing how the translucent triangle part 
                                started thinning out until there developed an eye hole, and then one 
                                day the string just broke ...(see "Peter S. an expert" - <A HREF="../../letters.html#start">http://www.male-initiation.net/letters.html</A>). </P>
                              <P>During my readings on the condition of frenulum breve including 
                                the information I found on your homepage I came to the conclusion that 
                                the one incision technique of Manrique is in fact a partial frenectomy 
                                and who knows what is really lost during this intervention ?!!! With 
                                two clamps attached to the sides of the frenular triangle I mentioned 
                                above and cutting through it vertically to the penis shaft, this technique 
                                leaves two membranous flaps to die and dry out. A lot of blood vessels 
                                are cut and most probably important nerve fascicles. The Y-V-frenuloplasty 
                                and the Z-plasty operate differently and are certainly no frenectomies 
                                since there are several Y or Z like incisions in the upper part of 
                                the frenulum which are then sawn to the shaft in a way so as to make 
                                the frenulum flatter. </P>
                              <P>But I wonder what really happens to the nerve connections and blood 
                                vessels. Unfortunately the descriptions of these two techniques are 
                                not very precise and leave a lot of decisions to the urologist, needless 
                                to say on the basis of trial and error, I'm very much afraid to say. 
                                A lot of the frenuloplasties done here in Europe seem to be done in 
                                the emergency rooms of hospitals, i.e. when it rips during intercourse, 
                                and therefore certainly under time pressure and profuse bleeding of 
                                the area, and thus no conditions to study the frenulum breve under 
                                hands and conclude on the best way to deal with it. From the little 
                                information I could gather on the subject and I think I searched extensively 
                                enough I suppose urologists have still a lot to investigate or even 
                                to catch up.</P>
                              <P> Some of the questions which still prevade my mind and up to now 
                                none of the urologists I talked to could answer, I much doubt you can, 
                                but none the less I copied them. Maybe you'll be able to get some sense 
                                out of them, and if you want, you are free to present them in your 
                                homepage. </P>
                              <P>>1. Are there precise anatomical studies of the frenulum praeputii 
                                concerning its lengh, its thickness, its point of attachment on the 
                                glans which seems to vary enormously, its two niches a bit downwards 
                                from the corona, its rootlike spreading, its ending points, its venoles 
                                and arterioles, its nerve fascicles, its mechanoreceptors (probably 
                                pinkus-ingo and Meissner corpuscules) ? </P>
                              <P>R.S. I searched back to 1920 - ALL the studies which were available 
                                through the German libraries are presented frenulum_studies.html , 
                                so the answer is no, no and there are none - the frenulum does not 
                                always spread out in root form and as far as "pinkus-ingo" goes I`ve 
                                never seen the word in all my research ... </P>
                              <P>2. Where can I find descriptions of the expected normal functioning 
                                of the frenulum? Is it supposed to be such that it lets the inner mucosa 
                                of the prepuce to lie in a flat way along the shaft ??? This would 
                                certainly be advantageous in many ways during intercourse i.e. no ripping, 
                                less friction, a better gliding of the shaft in the vagina, enhanced 
                                sensitivity since all of the inner prepuce mucosa is exposed or has 
                                contact with the vaginal mucous walls!!! On the other side I gather 
                                that one of the functions of the frenulum is to avoid an unwanted exposition 
                                and drying out of the epithelium of the glans during nocturnal erections 
                                or emissions. </P>
                              <P>R.S. The anti circ sites have various theories on the function and 
                                purpose of the frenulum however it certainly isn`t to hold the foreskin 
                                forward, some men are born without a frenulum and the foreskin still 
                                comes forward! --- sure it has different effects and thus at times 
                                can be considered to serve a function, and that will be different depending 
                                on length or shortness of frenulum relative to length of foreskin etc. 
                                - personally I doubt if the frenulum evolved with any set "purpose" 
                                or function, (except when it is too short or persistant - to simplify 
                                the mating games in some mammal groups see evolution.html) it appears 
                                all higher mammals have frenular strings, which usually rip during 
                                the embryonic period, so I suspect the structure is related to secondary 
                                skin dvelopments such as webbed feet ... we could debate more on such 
                                themes ... it probably is a more primitive structure than phimosis 
                                ... </P>
                              <P>3. Since the frenulum is apparently a complex structure I wonder 
                                if its ripping near the glans corona is intended by nature like the 
                                ripping or tearing of the female hymen. These structures are certainly 
                                not homologous and so I do not dare the make any predictions but an 
                                answer to this would certaintly be crucial, not only in respect to 
                                sexual education of the younger but also as a medical issue i.e. concerning 
                                circumcision and even a health-wellness issue since more pleasure can 
                                be derived from a completely unfolded prepuce during intercourse. And 
                                I do not deny that it were the two scientific papers by Dr. C. Cold 
                                and Dr. Taylor published in the BJU, one in 1996, the other in 1999, 
                                that made me think about this in this way ! </P>
                              <P>R.S. Dr. Taylor studied 21 corpses whatever findings he made, he 
                                missed the fact that he was describing fibrotic phimotic rings and 
                                however many sensitive nerves they have a ring which is as tight as 
                                some of his pictures is simply painful, I`m afraid the advantages of 
                                common sense somehow slipped past the BMJ editors on this point. </P>
                              <P>In Bolivia, the Indian youths describe themselves as "cartridged" 
                                and eagerly await their first intercourse when their frenulum rips, 
                                and they can claim to be "uncartridged" (I eagerly await further news 
                                from an anthropoligist who is writing a paper on this) - interesting 
                                from our perspective is that in Bolivia the frenulum size and shape 
                                is so predictable that it develops a "meaning" and is viewed on a par 
                                with losing the virginity thus with breaking the hymen - </P>
                              <P>4. Unfortunately there seems still to be much confusion even among 
                                urologist concerning frenulum breve and phimosis. Where does one condition 
                                end, where does the other begin ??? From the case studies I read about 
                                very often both conditions are refered to occur simultaneously. It 
                                may very well be so ! None the less phimosis even partial phimosis 
                                is a condition very well defined by the phimotic ring which has very 
                                little or nothing to do with the frenulum. That a short frenulum certainly 
                                worsens the phimotic condition that is another thing. Understanding 
                                the interplay of prepuce and frenulum would surely shed new light on 
                                surgical interventions like circumcision, frenectomy and frenuloplasty. </P>
                              <P>R.S. Indeed this is true This point is not adequately covered in 
                                my site, (but please not too much self-criticism it was necessary first 
                                to describe the conditions separately) ... But yes, I believe that 
                                frequently men suffer a mixture of the two, - the phimotic ring seems 
                                always or often? to branch round like a hangman`s noose and lead into 
                                the frenulum, - if you have contact with a practical urologist he should 
                                be able to tell us if this is typical seldom or always, I believe the 
                                phimotic ring always curves back into the frenulum as two branches 
                                of the frenulum even when the frenulum is long enough ... I`d like 
                                to know, I very much feel that the visible external features of the 
                                frenulum are so vaguely described in the literature that well, it would 
                                probably be typical for our upside down culture to start studying the 
                                internal nervous systems before they even put on their spectacles and 
                                look. </P>
                              <P>BTW: If phimotic ring and frenulum are the same or similar skin 
                                tissue then frenulum breve may also respond to Betamethasone. </P>
                              <P>Since there are still a lot of men and youngsters being circumcised 
                                for unclear medical conditions such as phimosis and frenulum breve, 
                                and since the frenulum is truely the male G-point, </P>
                              <P>I don't suppose my questions are major issues compared to all what 
                                is going on in the U.S. concerning circumcision. And I dare say a lot 
                                of urologists just don't seem to think or care enough about these issues. 
                                According to the results of Dr. Christopher Cold's and Dr. J. R.Taylor's 
                                research on the prepuce mucosa I really think that circumcision or 
                                any kind of excision or abblation of preputial or frenular tissue should 
                                only be performed when nothing else works and in any case the patient 
                                should be completely and extensively informed by the urologist of what 
                                is going to happen and what the consequences might be. I don't know 
                                about Great Britain, but here in Germany an urologist told me circumcision 
                                among adult males - specially gay males - is starting to become a trend. 
                                I cannot really imagine why ??? </P>

                              <P>Sehr geehrter Herr ______, <BR>
                                Sie haben sich offensichtlich mehr Gedanken &uuml;ber das Fenulum gemacht 
                                als alle Urologen. Wenn Sie bislang keine Probleme mit dem B&auml;ndchen 
                                hatten, gibt es m.E. keinen Grund sich darum Sorgen zu machen oder 
                                irgend etwas zu unternehmen. </P>
                              <P>Operative Eingriffe am Frenulum werden nur durchgef&uuml;hrt wenn der 
                                Patient damit Probleme hat, dann wenn es einrei&szlig;t (dann meist im Notdienst) 
                                oder wenn Beschwerden von Seiten eines kurzen Frenulums auftreten (meist 
                                nachdem es bereits eingerissen und narbig verheilt ist). Dann erfolgt 
                                eine Frenulumplastik, die in der Weise erfolgt, dass das Frenulum quer 
                                inzidiert und anschlie&szlig;end l&auml;ngs vern&auml;ht wird. Anschlie&szlig;ende Probleme 
                                (insbesondere was das Gef&uuml;hl angeht) sind mir nicht bekannt. </P>
                              <P>Ihre Fragen kann ich nur recht allgemein beantworten: Genaue anatomische 
                                Studien (&uuml;ber das hinausgehend was Sie im Anatomiebuch finden) gibt 
                                es meines Wissens nicht, ebensowenig &uuml;ber spezielle nervale Versorgungen. 
                                Auch besondere Untersuchungen &uuml;ber die "normale" Funktionsweise des 
                                Frenulums sind mir nicht bekannt. </P>
                              <P>Mit freundlichen Gr&uuml;&szlig;en <BR>
                                (Name of the urologist) </P>

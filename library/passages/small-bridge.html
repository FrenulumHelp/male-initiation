        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P>Robin Stuart:<BR>
                                I read your article "Innocence to Ignorance" and the article by "Michel 
                                Beauge" on "Alternative methods to circumcision" over the Web. </P>
                              <P>I have a personal question. I would be very happy if you could give 
                                me suggestions. I am 22 years old and I have Phimosis. The frenum (frenulum) 
                                at the tip of the foreskin seems to be attached by a small cord to 
                                the penis just below the tip of the penis. This prevents the foreskin 
                                to go back fully. My foreskin is not too loose either. It is tight 
                                and is just barely able to go back over the glans. But it can't go 
                                over it because the foreskin is attached to the penis (the tip of the 
                                frenum is attached to the tip the penis by a small cord). </P>
                              <P>I have never had an intercourse so I do not know if this condition 
                                of my foreskin will cause pain during intercourse. Do you know if it 
                                will be painful? By reading some articles on the Web I get an impression 
                                that the normal condition is when the foreskin fully retracts. Since 
                                it doesn't retract beyond the tip of the penis I am worried that it 
                                might cause pain during an intercourse. Is a circumcision necessary? 
                                I will be glad if you could answer my problem.</P>
                              <P> You seem to be describing a skin bridge. <BR>
                                get the skin bridge cut,<BR>
                                you probably dont need circumcision worry about that later

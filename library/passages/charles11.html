        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P> As an answer to: Phimosis... written by DD at 13 Sep 2000 05:25:48: 
                              <P> Hi DD: Your closing sentence was "I just wondered if it is likely 
                                to interfere with intercourse? I don't exactly want to grab a girl 
                                and "test" it on her you know." If you -don't- want sex, there is your 
                                answer. Something is not normal, something is not right. Ultimate sexual 
                                pleasure and satisfaction can only be reached when you have access 
                                to the penis head to stimulate it directly. Doing so through the foreskin 
                                is like having sex with your slothes on, watching a movie with a bag 
                                over your head. or going to the opera with ear plugs. A common cure 
                                for phimosis is circumcision. However, you may be able to avoid this 
                                if you can get your foreskin loosened enough to make it retractable. 
                                After a hot bath, to make the skin loose and plyable, you can apply 
                                certain steroid creams or ointments to the outside of the foreskin 
                                near the end, and then begin stretching it back as much as possible 
                                but not to cause pain or injury. This may take frequent or regular 
                                attempts over a period of time to make it gradually loosen up more. 
                                Complete retraction so as to expose all of the penis head is the only 
                                acceptable goal. Your desciption of the problem sounds like phimosis 
                                due to the foreskin opening being too small, but there is also the 
                                possibility that normnal childhood adhestions of the inner skin to 
                                the penis head have not released and seperated, and that is a different 
                                condition that may require medical treatment. Let us know how you progress 
                                with this. Down below are some messages with the names of the creams 
                                and ointments and salves that you can try.<BR>

                              <P> Yes, there are many creams, gels, ointments and salves that people 
                                try with various degrees of results. This is another case where the 
                                sufferer uses the term "no problem" except it IS a problem. This guy 
                                is at the peak of his sexual development and should not be robbed of 
                                its pleasures by defending an unborn penis. This forum is so full of 
                                stories like this you would believe that half of Europe has phimosis 
                                and soon it will invade America as routine circumcision is being abandoned. 
                                Boys, your foreskin is -made- to retract for a reason. Use it or lose 
                                it. Teach your little brothers and cousins and sons to skin it back 
                                as soon as they can so they don't grow up with the problems you have.

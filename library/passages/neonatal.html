        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                            <TD><P><B>NEONATAL CIRCUMCISION?</B>
                              <P>Greetings from L.A.<BR>
                                My husband is European and was circumcised in Austria at age<BR>
                                5 years due to the foreskin tightening and restricting urine flow.<BR>
                                He has very bad memories of the procedure and hospital stay. He<BR>
                                has experienced sensitivity of the glans since that surgery.<BR>
                                In order to avoid a similar experience for our sons, would it be wise<BR>
                                to plan to circumcise at birth? Thank you for your feedback.<BR>
  <BR>
  <BR>
                                I really feel any routine cut is inappropriate in the modern world, 
                                an appropriate modern initiation is surely to do with self experiment 
                                and exploration and education. 
                              <P> there are a number of individual variations of different problems 
                                which can occur, maybe around a 15% chance of problems before adulthood 
                                .and most of these can be easily checked for in advance, (and most 
                                problems can be cured without a full circumcision) .... also your child 
                                must get a bit of basic education on foreskin cleanliness etc. <BR>
  <BR>
                                ... your man was one of those who needed the operation, (ie. with phimosis) 
                                ... but a partial circ. would have been adequate - leaving some cover 
                                for the hyper sensitive glans after the operation - partial circ. is 
                                as good an all-cure as full circumcision if not better.<BR>
  <BR>
                                can I advise <BR>

                                for how to check simply, and<BR>
  <A HREF="../../natures_way.html#start">http://www.male-initiation.net/natures_way.html</A><BR>
                                as an optimal start on how to care for an infants foreskin ...it was 
                                written by a mother of two ...<BR>
  <BR>
                                Parents have so much to look after and learn about with new borns and 
                                taking them to all sorts of medical checks all the time ... it could 
                                easily appear as the simplest thing to get him circ'd ... but even 
                                if he is circ`d you will need to check him in the following days and 
                                weeks for skin-bridges ... There`s no intelligent way around the modern 
                                medical approach of early checking

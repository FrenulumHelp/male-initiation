        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                            <TD><P><B>UNTHINKABLE, DISTURBING ...SO I FORGOT ABOUT IT</B>
                              <P>The only time that I can pull back the foreskin is when I'm in a 
                                flaccid state...and even then, it does not go completely past the glans 
                                (probably cuz the frenulum is too short, since I can see it being stretched 
                                to maximum capacity).</P>
                              <P>In an erect state, there's probably some phimosis going on, since 
                                the foreskin opening is too narrow for the glans to go thru so that 
                                only about 15%-20% of the glans is exposed...trying to get the foreskin 
                                go behind the glans during an erection would be unthinkable and impossible 
                                (well..it's possible, but I wouldn't want to die of pain). </P>
                              <P>First off, I realised that something was different about age 10 
                                when other kids' could expose their glans and I couldn't. It was disturbing 
                                at the time...but I was still young...so I forgot about it. Since then, 
                                I never really noticed anything wrong until about 3 years ago. </P>
                              <P>I don't have any sexual experiences to tell you since I'm still 
                                a virgin...i'm one of those guys who waits until marriage. </P>
                              <P>Here's why: I began masturbating about the age of 15. It felt good...orgasms 
                                here and there. Then at 17, sometime after my first Biology course, 
                                I began thinking how I was to penetrate. While masturbating and thinking 
                                about how I was to penetrate, I began comparing how I was doing it 
                                and how it would really be like. I noticed a difference. 
                              <P>When I masturbate, the entire glans are never exposed. I usually 
                                hold the part below the glans and made the necessary movements back 
                                and forth, never pulling the foreskin back further than I could handle. 
                                Other than that I don't do all the other strange (not to make fun of 
                                anyone) things listed on your reference homepage. Although, I have 
                                gotten orgasms from a vibrating messager with my pants on. Just turn 
                                it on, and press it against yourself. I never tried this again due 
                                to lack of enthusiasm. And of course I've masturbated against a pillow 
                                and mattress when I was young but not anymore...it wastes too much 
                                time. By the way...I really hate ejaculating during a restful sleep. 
                                It's enough that we have to deal washing our faces in the morning. </P>
                              <P>As far as the foreskin opening, when flaccid, I'm able to pull the 
                                foreskin almost behind the glans but not quite (with the frenulum is 
                                at maximum stretching capacity). I recently tried this about a few 
                                days ago for the first time in my life. However, in an erect state 
                                the foreskin opening is just too small and the glans bearly shows (about 
                                20% of the glans are exposed and the frenulum is not even visible hiding 
                                under the foreskin). Trying to pull back the foreskin during an erect 
                                state would be very painful if not impossible.</P>
                              <P>(RS first operate the frenulum and then see if theres any phimosis)

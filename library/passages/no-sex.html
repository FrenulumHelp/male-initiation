        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P>Hi Robin,<BR>
                                I hope you dont mind me writing to you, but the nature of my condition 
                                embarasses me greatly.</P>
                              <P>I'm 40 and married. </P>
                              <P>My foreskin has been tight for as long as I can remember. I do remember 
                                once (about13 years old I think ) being taken to my doctor about it, 
                                and the outcome I think, or his opinion, was - "it will stretch".</P>
                              <P>When my penis is soft, my foreskin does retract all the way - very 
                                easliy in the shower, but not so easily when dry out of the shower, 
                                and I've always been worried that it may get stuck when dry. When erect, 
                                its not comfortable to retract the foreskin all the way. Maybe about 
                                75% but beyond that it feels as if the skin will rip. In the bath, 
                                I can retract it whilst erect.</P>
                              <P>Sex has usually been stressful (rather than uncomfortable) to the 
                                point where I dont have it now. I found wearing a condom (with the 
                                forseskin about 75% retracted when i placed the condom on ) has reduced 
                                stress.</P>
                              <P>Recently, each morning, I have been gently pulling the foreskin 
                                back further in the shower and after a month now, it does seem to have 
                                responded by being easier to retract and it goes back further. I have 
                                also noticed that it seems to travel back further when erect too, but 
                                not (comfortably ) all the way. If I do get it back all the way, the 
                                head looks big and I tend to return the foreskin.</P>
                              <P>I have looked at your www site, and I dont appear to have this "ring" 
                                you speak of.</P>
                              <P>This has been going on so long now, I DO want to to something about 
                                it - if only to talk through what has happened to me, and discuss my 
                                options. However, the thought of a doctor tugging at my penis and examining 
                                me - fills me with dread.</P>
                              <P>---------------------<BR>
                                My first suspicion is that it must be frenulum breve ... the ideas 
                                on "comfort" and "stressful" are typical for frenulum breve ... </P>
                              <P>Hummm now ... I&laquo;ve read your letter 2 or 3 times, and I&laquo;d like you 
                                to check out if its frenulum breve before we go any further<BR>

                              <P>>I've always >been worried that it may get stuck when dry.</P>
                              <P>but it never did get stuck? .. I think its a short frenulum, if 
                                not I promise I&laquo;ll think again</P>
                              <P>first things first<BR>
                                and good luck<BR>

                                Thanks so much for your reply. It was a big step for me to actually 
                                write that first letter to you after living with this for so long, 
                                and I very much appreciate your reply.</P>
                              <P>On to business...<BR>

                              <P>I've studied this page and the related ones and taken a good look 
                                at my penis, here's what I find. Honestly, I find it difficult to "diagonse" 
                                but here are some points which may help.</P>
                              <P>My foreskin, when fully forward, does not entirely cover the glands 
                                - ever. The Uretha is always exposed as is a small area of the surrounding 
                                glands .</P>
                              <P>If I gently pinch the forsekin and pull upwards with a finger and 
                                thumb, I can see my frenulum - a thin strip of skin. It looks short 
                                - perhaps from the glands, about 2-3mm before it gets thicker and joins 
                                to the foreskin.</P>
                              <P>This area has ripped before during intercourse a couple of times. 
                                Small amount of blood, a lot of worry, and a quick heal i seem to remember.</P>
                              <P>When erect, and my foreskin is back about 75%, the frenulum looks 
                                very stretched and shiny, but the foreskin is not fully retracted. 
                                A feeling of tension where the frenulum is? YES !! It "feels" as if 
                                I want to "roll" back (as apposed to pull back ) the remainder of the 
                                foreskin over the glands without stretching the frenulum any more.</P>
                              <P>When erect, if I do attempt to retract the foreskin further (during 
                                masturbation), I have had a couple of re-curring results which may, 
                                or may not be relevant. 1) My penis softens (perhaps cos I'm thinking 
  "this is gonna rip! and 2) I become very aroused and have a experienced 
                                a short dry orgasm where the glands appears to be pumping like a regular 
                                orgasm but no semen is expelled. After this, I can continue to masterbate 
                                and orgasm normally, but with the foreskin going back to its more "comfortable" 
                                position.</P>
                              <P>During masterbation, my foreskin slides back and forth over the 
                                glands - rarely retracting more than, as I have said, about 75%.</P>
                              <P>> >I've always > >been worried that it may get stuck when dry. > 
  > but it never did get stuck? .. I think its a short frenulum, if not 
                                I > promise I&laquo;ll think again</P>
                              <P>No - its not ever got stuck as I recall. Just the feeling that it 
                                will.</P>
                              <P>I have to be honest, i know it will take much courage to breeze 
                                into my GP's surgery and let him examine me. Knowing more about the 
                                procedure and options will help me with this.</P>
                              <P>---------------------------<BR>

                              <P>this sounds like a skinbridge - is the thin strip of skin above 
                                or below the glans?</P>

                              <P> -the frenulum op.</P>
                              <P>>Please tell me... your op.... how did they numb you up? Did you 
                                have a <BR>
  >local or general? And, did it hurt? How long to heal? </P>
                              <P>In Germany its easy 1 week waiting for the op., no pain local anaesthetic, 
                                two weeks healing, very blue and bruised for 2 days after the operation 
                                ... </P>
                              <P>>I presume to see a urologist I will have to be referred by my general 
  >practioner?? He is always rushed and not particulary approachable. 
                                Do you >have any thoughts on this??</P>
                              <P>oh dear the UK national Health system, .. in some areas it can be 
                                a good idea to ring your local hospital ... urology department ... </P>
                              <P>the operation is simpler than circumcision, the only mistake I often 
                                hear is that the docs cut any remaining "dissolving" stitches ... this 
                                is probably a rather silly habit among surgeons after ops. on legs 
                                and arms etc. ... however it gets rather itchy under a foreskin ... </P>
                              <P>anyway if he starts snipping around 2 weeks after the op. then probably 
                                best not to disturb him, just get a pair of tweezers out afterwards 
                                and pull the sharp bits out ...<BR>
                                cheers<BR>

        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                                At the beginning of puberty when I first started masturbating I did 
                                this in the flaccid state (ie. without erection) till ejaculation. 
                                At night, I would half-wake from deep sleep with an erection and without 
                                even thinking I would quell it and then go back to sleep. Erections 
                                were possible but somehow they just didn`t interest me. 
                              <P>I was open enough emotionally to enjoy a number of intimate affairs 
                                and to fall in love fairly often. And here, though penetration was 
                                often difficult, I enjoyed every moment of intimacy. One remarkable 
                                symptom was that no girl-friend could touch my erect penis, well, all 
                                except one and she pulled forward on the foreskin, - when she tried 
                                to hold the phallus I lost my erection, she was disappointed and I 
                                had to explain, as always, "Yeah that always happens". Over the years 
                                my sexual appetite became more amd more limited, distanced (voyeuristic) 
                                and frustrated, and still when alone, embarrassingly, the most enjoyable 
                                way of masturbating was in the flaccid state. </P>
                              <P>I went through several long periods of questioning my behaviour. 
                                I generally did this from the standpoint of our cultures usual understanding 
                                that such behavioural patterns are due to early environment and upbringing. 
                                Psychologists confirmed this approach. I questioned every possible 
                                situation. My behaviour was most certainly all mixed up with repressive 
                                patterns from my parents (as could be expected in any integrated personality), 
                                but generally I could "forgive" my parents because even if they had 
                                supposedly undermined my sexuality they had given me enough emotional 
                                health to build relationships, trust, fall in love and surely this 
                                was more than most young men and should have given me ample opportunity 
                                to re-learn.</P>
                              <P><B>Discovery</B><BR>
                                At 43 (In 1994) I`d questioned everything which seemed possible or 
                                logical and decided quite rationally to consider impossible questions. 
                                I believed my anatomical equipment was normal, as every self respecting 
                                male believes but nevertheless, I asked the ridiculous question: could 
                                it be anything anatomical?</P>
                              <P>During the examination of my erection I pulled back the foreskin 
                                and it sprang forward again as it always had, I scientifically continued 
                                to experiment - pulling back even further, and noticed first a white 
                                ring, when I saw how the glans was being pulled at an angle I was still 
                                unsure if this was normal! Then suddenly I remembered the first time I`d 
                                retracted my foreskin at the beginning of puberty: first releasing 
                                the painful adhesive layer between the glans and foreskin, then the 
                                phimotic ring scraping over the previously unexposed glans and latching 
                                behind the glans for a brief moment before the foreskin was catapaulted 
                                forward by the frenulum breve - I had grasped myself in horror scared 
                                that I had damaged my future manhood for ever. I had learnt without 
                                any shadow of doubt, that my foreskin was not meant to be retracted.</P>
                              <P>I had adapted to love making always holding the foreskin forward 
                                and controlling the size of my erection. (it is generally thought that 
                                men cannot control the size of their erection, the fear of pain can 
                                obviously exert a stronger influence). Those times when I did masturbate 
                                with an erection, I repeatedly made quick pulls at the end of the foreskin 
                                to keep it forward, this happened as a continuation of the forward 
                                movement during masturbation and I was only dimly aware of the habit.</P>

                              <P>How embarrassing! - I myself felt amazed that I hadn`t discovered my curious condition 
                                earlier - I felt like a joke figure. I was frequently asked: "Why did 
                                it take you so long to discover?" I was stumped, it was so obvious 
                                to me, yet so hard to explain in words : now I can explain it<B> :</B> the subconscious impression of pain before puberty, the conscious but 
                                repressed experience at puberty, confirmed by every experience in adolescent 
                                and adult life ... people avoid pain ... people develop habits.                              </P>
                              <P>It often takes a long time for anyone and
                              everyone to discover things, and this happens with lots of people in lots of different walks of life, even when
                              there is adequate available information ... and often the answers are obvious (e.g. the earth goes round the sun) but first, someone needed to ask the right question. </P>
                              <P><B>Afterwards</B><BR>
                                After the operation I could enjoy full erections for the first time 
                                and my erection was 2 cm longer than previously. I masturbated only 
                                erect and had no interest in doing it flaccid for the next six months, 
                                long after the secondary injury.</P>
                              <P>On around the 20th. full erection an intensive pain shot through 
                                one side of my erect penis ... Urologists had no idea what it was and 
                                when hearing the sexual effects of my previous condition diagnosed 
                                psychosomatic causes. The pain continued, I was traumatised and it took 
                                several years of research to find similar cases in the medical literature 
                                and internet. It seems a great rarity and <A HREF="http://members.lycos.co.uk/nervefracture/" TARGET="_blank">a nerve must be ripped or 
                                trapped</A>. 
                              <P>And thus I developed a second reason to get involved with the impolite 
                                subject of male genital pain.</P>

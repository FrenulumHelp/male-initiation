        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                      <TD><P><B>CURIOUS TO GET CLEAR ANSWERS ONLY WHEN ONE IS 47</B>
                        <P>Some personal information : Living in Switzerland, born in Italy, 
                          46, married, no children, circumcised.</P>
                        <P>Since 10 days, I have access from home to Internet and I found on 
                          the Web a lot of information on circumcision issues. </P>
                        <P>Among other sites, I found your site and your essay "From Innocence 
                          to Ignorance" and I would like to give you my feedback and my personal 
                          experience.</P>
                        <P>I agree that circumcision is a cultural taboo. I have learned much 
                          more in ten days than in 40 years and I need to exchange experience. </P>
                        <P>I was circumcised when I was 10 months old because of a phimosis. 
                          For reasons which I still don't know, the surgeon left on the penis 
                          some seven skin bridges on the right side of the shaft near the frenulum 
                          connecting the glans with the shaft. Some were positioned exactly on 
                          the edge of the scar in connection with the glans, some between the 
                          scar and the corona. As a young boy, I never understood where these 
                          adhesions were coming from. For many years, I thought that they were 
                          the rest of the foreskin attached to the glans on purpose ! I was wondering 
                          how a circumcision is done, especially when I realized that other circumcised 
                          boys had no such skin bridges. </P>
                        <P>My erect penis was a little bit curved on the right, but without 
                          any pain or trouble. One of the skin bridges broke during love-making 
                          (when I was 26). When I was 32, during a check (for other reasons), 
                          an urologist proposed me to remove these skin bridges for esthetical 
                          reasons, which I accepted.</P>
                        <P>Since then, I am very satisfied to be circumcised for esthetical 
                          reasons. We are, my wife and myself, naturists. My evaluation is that, 
                          in Europe, about 50% of the male naturists are circumcised. I don't 
                          know, of course, why, but I am sure that it is because of the aesthetic. </P>
                        <P>I would like to thank you for the excellent information which I 
                          found on your site. It helps me to found the answers to a lot of questions 
                          ! </P>
                        <P>I would appreciate also to get your opinion : as mentioned in the 
                          beginning, to break this cultural taboo is necessary to exchange experience 
                          with other people. I know that I do not fit with your approach to "check 
                          uncircumcised boy before puberty". In my case, a check before puberty 
                          could have solved some "troubles" with clear answers to my questions 
                          and with the removal of the skin bridges earlier.</P>
                        <P>Your question :<BR>
  >Did the skin bridges cause the curve? i.e. after they were removed 
                          did the phallus straighten out ?</P>
                        <P>The answer is yes.</P>
                        <P>______________<BR>
                          I particular appreciate your description of treatment of phimosis and 
                          of skin bridges. As mentioned before, I was circumcised as an infant 
                          because of a phimosis and the left skin bridges were removed when I 
                          was 32. I finally get the answers to questions that were without any 
                          clear answers during years. In one of your previous answers, you wonder 
                          that "a circumcised boy is able to see everything and thus be aware 
                          of any problem". I was really asking myself - especially during puberty 
                          - what are these "skin bridges" ?, are they normal (i.e. are skin bridges 
                          also present under the foreskin) ? are they a consequence of the circumcision 
                          ? It is curious to get clear answers only when one is 47         </TD></TR></TABLE></TD>

        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P>I read your essay with great interest. I'm 22 and I have a problem 
                                that ressembles the one you described. The problem almost ruined the 
                                relationship with the woman of my life. I'm going to consult a physician 
                                next week and reading your essay helped me to understand what I'm going 
                                through.</P>
                              <P>Thank you very much. You don't know how much I needed to read this! </P>
                              <P>Hi Robin. I'll try to help you the best I can, but there are two 
                                obstacles that will restrain me from giving precise details. First, 
                                I'm not sure I fully understand my problem and I can't definitively 
                                say that all my problems are related to the fact that my foreskin is 
                                too tight (even tough I'm pretty sure they are). Then, I have to mention 
                                to you that because of the fact that English is only my second language, 
                                I won't be able to use the proper biological terms (but I hope you 
                                will still understand what I want to say).</P>
                              <P>I can fully retract my foreskin at normal times, but I most definitively 
                                can't when I have an erection. I dont feel any pain at times of erection, 
                                but I feel a big discomfort when there is pressure to retract the foreskin. 
                                I also have a major difficulty in getting and keeping an erection (it 
                                goes away very quickly - sometimes as soon as the penis is touched) 
                                - but I don't know to what extend this is related to the tightness 
                                of the foreskin. Because of these two problems, I didn't experience 
                                too many real sexual experiences (with penetration). During the experiences 
                                I had, some were relatively painless, even though I could feel a certain 
                                discomfort for hours after. Some other experiences were more painful. 
                                I guess it depended on the level of lubrication of the female organ 
                                (?). </P>
                              <P>The problem had big psychological repercussions. I experienced a 
                                big lack of self confidence and self esteem. It probably also contributed 
                                in part to the use of soft drugs and alcohol (to forget the problem). 
                                I also rarely tought of the problem, trying to forget it as soon as 
                                it came to my mind. There was also one or two times when there was 
                                a cerain bleeding (during my first experiences), but I couldn't tell 
                                exactly where it came from, because I only noticed it the morning after. </P>
                              <P>I don't recall having any infections (except when I was 5 or 6 years 
                                old) or any other more serious problems that you mentionned in your 
                                essay. </P>
                              <P>If you have more specific questions, feel free to send them. I would 
                                appreciate it, though, if you could ask the more specific questions 
                                at the end of your message, since other people can have access to my 
                                account.</P>
                              <P>I hope the few details I'm sending you will be able to help you 
                                in your project... </P>
                              <P>________________<BR>

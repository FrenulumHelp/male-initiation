        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P>Dear Robin, 
                              <P>I have recently dicovered that my nine year old son has phimosis. 
                                We went along to see the urologist who had a quick look at the problem 
                                and promptly asked the nurse to arrange for a circumcision. </P>
                              <P>When I asked what options were available, I was met with what can 
                                only be described as a 'blank look'. I left his consulting room, not 
                                reassured as I'd imagined, but frustrated and as much 'in the dark' 
                                as I had been previously. </P>
                              <P>This is where you come in, it occurred to me that if I looked at 
                                'circumcision' on the internet, I might at least know more about what 
                                was going to happen, and be able to help my son through it all. </P>
                              <P>This was pricisely how I stumbled upon your website and after spending 
                                some considerable time absorbing the relevant information, I revisited 
                                our doctor. It never ceases to amaze me just what a difference it makes 
                                when you sound like you know what you're talking about - I was not 
                                treated like some over-fussing mother, nor was I treated like an idiot 
                                who cannot absorb information. </P>
                              <P>The doctor will now refer my son to anyone I choose, and herein 
                                lies my problem........I can't find a surgeon who has performed a partial 
                                circ. or even one who has heard of this method of treatment. Am I going 
                                mad? How hard can it be? </P>
                              <P>In the meantime, my young chap is stressing out, can you point us 
                                in the right direction? Perhaps you have a list of urologists who are 
                                familiar with this treatment. We live in Manchester, England. I hope 
                                you can help us, Robin - any advice would be most welcome. </P>
                              <P>Yours sincerely, <BR>
                              </P>
                              <P> - it seems betamethasone 0.5% is the optimal treatment in 85% of 
                                all childhood cases of phimosis - a dermatologist (skin specialist) 
                                would be the optimal doctor. Cheers Robin</P>

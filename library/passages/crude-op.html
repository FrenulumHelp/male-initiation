        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P>Scarring as a result of phimosis poorly corrected? <BR>
                                I am an adult male who has a scarred penis, and I am not certain what 
                                caused the problem. I am guessing that I had phimosis as a young child 
                                that was crudely delt with by surgery. My penis looks like an orange 
                                that was crudely pealed about 3/4 of the way down from the top leaving 
                                a jagged edge much like the remaining peal on an orange. I have never 
                                had an opportunity to speak with anyone who has experienced such scarring. 
                                As a child my foreskin hung down over the scarred area. As an ault 
                                it has now retracted all the way back and leaves the scarred area exposed. 
                                As well, as a teenager a urologist crudely enlarged my meatus leaving 
                                me subincised from the tip to the foreskin on the underside. In both 
                                cases I feel mutilated and would like to know if other men have experienced 
                                such mutilation and how they have dealth with it. 
                              <P>Very sorry to hear of your experience, yes there are many others 
                                who have suffered at the hands of inexpert doctors chopping around 
                                on their penis at a young age ... ... , Now, my site , and my theme 
                                is to do with anatomical difficulties and the need to cure them appropriately, 
                                I`m not such an expert on treatment itself, I feel once the medical 
                                profession is aware of its importance then well really thats their 
                                job ... in the meantime, there is a large group of people like you 
                                who were badly operated in the anti-circ. groups in the USA, .... its 
                                true some of these men are fanatics, but the most of them are OK guys, 
                                ... I dont know the exact address of the anti-circ. mailing list ... 
                                sorry - but it cant be too hard to find, - write a note to<BR>

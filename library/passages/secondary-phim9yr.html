        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P>I have a 9 year old son who is not circumcised and until a few months 
                                ago there was no problem retracting the foreskin. Today when I was 
                                bathing him I asked him to pull his foreskin back and he could not, 
                                at all. It was completely tight as would be a turtleneck sweater pull 
                                over your head and tied at the top. When I tried to retract it, I was 
                                unsuccessful actually his penis wound up going into his body not out 
                                of the foreskin. Does this sort of thing happen so rapidly? Is this 
                                a fluke? 
                              <P>----------<BR>
                                First, its not a fluke it happens often particularly around puberty, 
                                well actually through the whole childhood till when boys stop growing, 
                                ... 
                              <P>There is insufficient research on the causes and cures, and if you 
                                surf around a bit, you'll notice merely a variety of opinions on what 
                                to do about this situation. 
                              <P>My opinion is offered on<BR>
                                  <A HREF="../../phimosis_treatment.html#start">http://www.male-initiation.net/phimosis_treatment.html </A>
                              <P>In short in your case, anatomically speaking your son needs a partial 
                                circumcision, ... ask if you want a short justification of why, the 
                                full reasoning is on my phimosis treatment file ... the relevant point 
                                is that at 9 yrs. old your son can make his own decisions about this 
                                sort of thing, so maybe you suggest it to him ... 
                              <P>Generally speaking I'd say yours is pretty good timing, a few years 
                                later after puberty begins, is when it could start causing problems, 
                                and then your son might probably feel a bit private and never talk 
                                with you about any problem ... so, you can get it fixed before puberty, 
                                or at least your son is aware of the possibility of getting it fixed, 
                                ... an almost ideal modern initiation ...

        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                            <TD><P><B>SKINBRIDGE at 30 yrs. old</B>
                              <P>Hello Mr. Stuart. I just want to let you know that I am glad I stumbled 
                                on to these web pages. I am 30 years old, and have been sexually active 
                                since the age of 15. I always knew i was "different", but didn't know 
                                why. In recent years sex has become a "chore" rather than pleasurable 
                                due to the constant tension, ripping and pain. The psychological impact, 
                                the feelings of sexual inadequacy are,in my mind, a big part of my 
                                lack of self esteem. My wife doesn't understand the whole" male pride 
                                thing". 
                              <P> I've seen two urologists. The first one didn't even have a "name" 
                                for what was wrong. But simply pointed out how I was circumcised incorrectly, 
                                and how I dont have the "mushroom" appearance of a normal male and 
                                he wanted to do an "extensive plastic repair in addition to removing 
                                atrophied tissue". He made it sound like brain surgery. The next guy 
                                took one look and said"oh, that's nothing, just phimosis,we'll just 
                                open it up and you'll be fine." That was a year ago. I am confused 
                                to the disparity between the two opinions. After further research on 
                                my own, I am taking a guess that I simply have adhesions and skin bridges 
                                (which cause my glans to bend downward upon erection). I am visiting 
                                a 3rd urologist today. I am printing out all of your pages and bringing 
                                it to him. I am extremely afraid of ANY surgery, let alone surgery 
                                on my penis. However, I am at the point that sex is so unenjoyable,and 
                                it is starting to have an effect on my marriage,that doing nothing 
                                is worse. The problem is that doctors (in my opinion) treat diseases, 
                                not patients. I need a doctor who understands that the psychological 
                                effects are as bad, if not worse than the physical. Wish me luck today. 
                                If you have any advice for me, I would really appreciate a response. 
                                If there is something I am not doing, I would like to know. </P>
                              <P>I am also going to leave the literature for the doctor to leave 
                                in his waiting room. There are plenty of brochures about prostate and 
                                other problems, but nothing on this subject. Maybe because the pharmaceutical 
                                companies can't make any money on it. </P>
                              <P>Thanks to you for having the desire to help people and putting this 
                                info on the web. </P>
                              <P>Sincerely, _____ </P>
                              <P>I visited the third urologist. I do not have phimosis...(I am circumsized). 
                                My diagnosis is simply "Glanular adhesions" and he is going to do a 
  "circumcision revision" using a laser surgery (the name of the laser 
                                starts with an "H" (holuum or something like that). He is going to 
                                use a "ring block" local anesthetic and he said the surgery will take 
                                at the maximum 20 minutes (i might need a stitch or two). He is very 
                                understanding, he says while to him "nothing is minor" in the scope 
                                of things it is a relatively simple procedure and he expects a full 
                                resolution of the problem after surgery. wish me luck </P>

        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P>From Newsgroups<BR>
                                My son was born with phimosis -- foreskin too tight and sealed from 
                                the inside with skin adhesions. He was able to pee ok but his pediatrician 
                                told me from day 1 that he likely would start to have problems as he 
                                got older. They suggested I try to stretch the opening gently. This 
                                is a very delicate part and I did try for a few months when he was 
                                a baby but it didn't make any difference. (IMO you'd need to fit an 
                                instrument in there to have any chance at stretching it and I was not 
                                about to try anything like that.)</P>
                              <P>A few months ago, at age 3.75, he started having itching and irritation. 
                                I did not want him circumcized for all the usual reasons. Instead the 
                                pediatric urologist did a "dorsal slit procedure." Richard was put 
                                under a general anesthetic in the hospital and a small, straight incision 
                                was made along the top of his foreskin and then it was stiched up. 
                                They gave him a caudal block (in the caudal space of the spine) and 
                                that did not wear off for 10 hours (approx.) so he never complained 
                                of pain. He had a lot of swelling but did not complain of pain and 
                                was back in daycare a few days later. Now the swelling has gone down 
                                and the stitches have fallen out. Cosmetically he looks very good IMO 
                                -- like a normal foreskin only with a bit of a "notch". Most of his 
                                glans is covered. The pediatric urologist had hoped not to cut so far, 
                                but he tried 2 times and there were so many skin adhesions he could 
                                not retract the fireskin so he had to try a 3rd time and make the incision 
                                longer. If he had been able to make the usual sized dorsal slit I think 
                                Richard would have looked untouched, as even now you can hardly notice 
                                it. The pediatric urologist mentioned that the foreskin must be cut 
                                evenly on both sides, and that there is a technique to doing it right, 
                                so that there will not be any tearing or bleeding of the incision later.</P>
                              <P>I did learn that very frequently boys are re-circed because the 
                                pediatrician or ob/gyn does it in the hospital and they are not surgeons 
                                and often do not do a good job. I talked to a few moms in the waiting 
                                room who were taking their sons in to be re-circed due to ragged or 
                                uneven circing. This is usually done under general anesthetic. My advise 
                                for anyone having surgery done on a child's genitals, including circumcision, 
                                is to have it done by a pediatric urologist. My insurance would only 
                                have covered circing by my ob/gyn, if we'd had it done, so that might 
                                be a problem for many people as well. The insurance companies maybe 
                                don't want to pay for a specialist to do it.</P>
                              <P>I feel the same way about the circumcision wars. They are ridiculous. 
                                Two people emailed me, berating me for having it done! As if they were 
                                there! I mean, I had been worrying about it since he was born and tried 
                                gently stretching (not pulling it off the glans just stretching the 
                                bottlenose part). It was no use as the bottlenose part was loaded with 
                                adhesions. The doctor made a small incision then a bigger one then 
                                on the third try a bigger one. Each time he tried to retract but there 
                                were so many adhesions that he had to do a bigger dorsal slit than 
                                usual. So a bit of the glans is exposed, as opposed to no glans exposed. 
                                But it cosmetically look good and Richard is a lot more comfortable 
                                and I think he got the best treatment available. </P>
                              <P>Anyway, the doctor is a pediatric urologist named Dr. Julian Wan. 
                                He works at Childrens Hospital in Buffalo for their urology department. 
                                I am not at work now but will get you the phone number tomorrow ( or 
                                if I forget remind me). I don't know if he has anything written down 
                                or not, but it was clear that there is a technique to the dorsal slit. 
                                Also, from talking to moms in the waiting room I get the impression 
                                that a lot of circumcisions are sloppily done and have to be redone. </P>

        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P>Hello,<BR>
                                I think I may have a form of Phimosis. I am a 24 year old circumcised 
                                male. When I am erect, I have a band of skin on the bottom of my penis 
                                that connects my head to the shaft. It becomes very tight and kind 
                                of angles my head in a downwards degree. I'm not sure if this can be 
                                operated on or not. But it makes me feel very uncomfortable and I am 
                                shy about showing it to woman, because I'm afraid they might think 
                                it's weird or gross or something. Should I book an appointment with 
                                my Dr. and ask him to reffer me to a urologyst (sp)? I live in Ontario, 
                                Canada, so would this be covered by the OHIP? I hope you can help. 
                                I would send you a picture with my scanner, but I don't think that 
                                would be a good Idea. Anyways any info would greatly be appreciated!<BR>
                                Thank you, 
                              <P>---------------<BR>

                                male.<BR>
                                Do you mean uncircumcised? is this a typo?, or really ? when were you 
                                circumcised?<BR>
                                From your description it sounds like frenulum breve, if so this will 
                                require a very simple operation, not a circumcision <BR>
                                ... go to <A HREF="../../frenulum_breve.html#start">http://www.male-initiation.net/frenulum_breve.html</A><BR>
                                Robin<BR>
                              <P>---------------<BR>
                                Yep, that's right I am circumcised. I was circumcised at birth. I checked 
                                out the Frenulum Breve section and that's what I'm pretty sure I have. 
                                .... Also what is a good way to clean underneath the Frenulum Breve? 
                                I read on the website using a cu-tip, is this accurate? Should I add 
                                any water or disinfectants to it? Is there another way of cleaning 
                                it? 
                              <P>I also have another question, when I ejaculate, I sort of just drizzle 
                                or drip out. I don't shoot. I there anything that can be done to help 
                                me shoot? Should I start eating healthier and exercising? Is there 
                                an operation for this? Or is this something that I have to live with? 
                              <P>---------------<BR>
                                Go to the frenulum treatment section for a few ideas on treatment, 
                                there's various methods, all of them are OK, ...<BR>
                                I'd very much appreciate a pic if you manage to take one, ...<BR>
                                using a q tip refers to uncircumcised men who cant retract to clean.<BR>
                              <P>>I also have another question, when I ejaculate, I sort of just 
                                drizzle<BR>
  >or drip out. I don't shoot. I there anything that can be done to help 
  >me shoot?<BR>
                                This is one of the effects of frenulum breve ... it requires a very 
                                simple operation, .... read "Frenulum Treatment"<BR>
                                Hummm ... ask if there's any other questions, ... keep in touch and 
                                tell me what happens<BR>

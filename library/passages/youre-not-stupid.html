        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P>Subject: I&laquo;m Stupid<BR>
                                After reading your site I broke down and cryed, I'm a 23 year old male 
                                that never knew that my foreskin was meant to go back, I also suffer 
                                from impotence and after being to see 5 different doctors they could 
                                not tell me what was the cause, is it possible that my problem with 
                                the foreskin is related to the impotence? 
                              <P>I really need some help here, I'm ready for giving up, I'm so glad 
                                I found this web site, a lot of the problems you had are what I'm going 
                                through and let me tell you I can't take much more 
                              <P>please please please help me I don't know what to do. 
                              <P>-------------------<BR>
                                I'm pretty sure you're not stupid, if so then that means I was (for 
                                43 yrs.) <BR>
                                There are a hell of a lot of us who never realised that the foreskin <BR>
                                retracts ... <BR>
  <BR>
                                It seems to me that a foreskin problem will lead to late development 
                                and can <BR>
                                easily be related to impotence.<BR>
  <BR>
                                firstly there's usually/always a simple cure for foreskin problems, 
                                so try <BR>
                                not to feel desperate .... the only real problem is getting an accurate <BR>
                                diagnosis so that you can get an appropriate cure ...<BR>
                                ---. 
                              <P>So, whichever way you decide, the next important question is the 
                                DIAGNOSIS <BR>
                                .. what is the reason your foreskin wont retract, what is stopping 
                                it??<BR>
  <BR>
                                take care god bless<BR>
                                Robin<BR>
                              <P>Unfortunately this was when my PC broke, and I lost contact with 
                                the guy.

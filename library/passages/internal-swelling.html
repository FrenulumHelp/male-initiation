        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P>I read your letter, and its probably not the sort of thing anyone 
                                on the forum could answer, ... also I am not a trained Urologist ... 
                              <P>You need a real specialist ... I am afraid your situation might 
                                be something of a rarity, hope an expert could help. 
                              <P>>Dear Sir 
                              <P>>I am writing in desperation and request your assistance.<BR>
  >I had a circumcision back in Feb 1999 due to excessive infections 
                                at the base of the glans and a swelling of the foreskin after sexual 
                                intercourse. The swelling must have started during the intercourse 
                                but after ejaculation and retraction the swollen area became very painful 
                                and raw. Cold water was splashed onto it in an attempt to prevent further 
                                swelling and to reduce the burning sensation. After a while this became 
                                the usual chain of events except that it started to happen after masturbation 
                                and then when I woke up with an erection. 
                              <P> >The operation was performed in the February of 1999. After a couple 
                                of days I noticed that the swelling, that the doctor informed me would 
                                subside, was more defined and larger. The doctor was not aware, until 
                                my re-examination, of this problem which was a large swelling just 
                                on the scar tissue at the base of the glans where the slip of skin 
                                connects. The opposite area to this had become tight, with no swelling, 
                                due to the swelling on the other side pulling the unswollen skin tight, 
                                as it is to this day. 
                              <P> >I had blood tests performed searching for Melkersson Rosenthal 
                                Syndrome, by the refered Dermotologist, and nothing was found. I am 
                                now under going steroid injections which are leaving the area bruised 
                                sore and painful during erection. The area is semi fluid in that one 
                                day it feels spongy and the next it is rock hard even whilst flacid. 
                              <P> >Have you any ideas as to a treatment or cause as this problem 
                                is now affecting my psychological life as I have been unable to approach 
                                women due to the ugliness of my ailment and my last relationship broke 
                                down due to my inability to want sex, undress infront of her or talk 
                                about it through embarrasment. My dermotologist is reluctant to remove 
                                the area by surgery as he it is not sure that it would cure the problem. 
                              <P> >I sincerely hope you can help, as your article suggests you have 
                                done extensive research into this part of the anatomy. If you are unable 
                                to assist me in my plight, would you know of any one who might be able 
                                to assist.<BR>

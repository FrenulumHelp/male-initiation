        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                            <TD><P><B>RING RECURS SINCE 2 YEARS</B>
                              <P>I am 58 years old. Approximately 2 years ago, the onset of phimosis 
                                was noticed. Retraction is possible, though painful with the "ripping" 
                                of the foreskin when it is at its tightest.. 
                              <P>The situation began 2 years ago, lasted for a few months, then left. 
                                Approx. 1 month ago it returned, coinsiding with the wife having a 
                                yeast infection. Connection ? The situation follows a close 2 week 
                                period. ... Then it starts over again. I fully expect it to cease to 
                                be a problem in a few weeks, but also expect it to return at sometime 
                                in the future. 
                              <P>No matter how tight, I always succeed in full retraction in the 
                                shower and am very careful to clean well. When at the tightest, I will 
                                have a small "seepage" of blood from the tears. Only enough to notice 
                                on tissue. 
                              <P>My father had to have a circumcision when he was about my age, but 
                                I don't know why and all are gone, so no one to ask. 
                              <P>I should also mention that I have never had any surgery or even 
                                been in the hospital except for the occasional x-ray or simple test. 
                                So I am quite frightened concerning the probable circumcision. According 
                                to most I have read in books, or on the internet, this is usually the 
                                cure. I do not look forward to that. 
                              <P>Thanks for any help you can provide. 
                              <P>RS no infection, so probably a fibrotic (old age) phimosis, so preferable 
                                options are dorsal slit or partial circumcision of only the last 1cm.

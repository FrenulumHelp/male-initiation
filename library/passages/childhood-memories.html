        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P>The first 10 years of my life were punctuated by occasional episodes 
                                of pure hell (painful infected penis, or embarrassment & terror caused 
                                by clumsy, insensitive doctors who yanked the foreskin back while muttering 
                                about smegma & my need to be circumcised) followed by months of inattention 
                                (benign neglect?). At last, by age 10 years and 3 months, I managed 
                                to stretch & loosen my foreskin so that it became easy to retract at 
                                any time. 
                              <P>That was the end of any physical problem but by then the idea had 
                                been firmly implanted that there was Something Wrong With Me that would 
                                have to be remedied some day by circumcision. (I eventually got it 
                                done--after having tried dorsal slit which several of my college roommates 
                                had experienced and lived with quite happily--but by then the psychological 
                                harm had been done.) I believed that as "damaged goods" I would never 
                                be able to make a successful marriage. 
                              <P>I truly feel that this had an inimical effect on my psychic makeup, 
                                and I am convinced that without the wrongly-treated foreskin problems 
                                of my early life, my later life wouldn't have been the emotional mess 
                                it often has been.

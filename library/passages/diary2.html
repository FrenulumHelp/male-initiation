        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P>The specific mixture of foreskin malformations which I grew up with, 
                                led to a bizarre initiation into manhood and were an underlying influence 
                                throughout my post puberty life. </P>
                              <P><B>Puberty</B><BR>
                                The first time I remember masturbating was around the age of 11 when 
                                I still had adhesions. I have a vivid memory of the occasion, it was 
                                after a bath when I discovered my erect penis. I remember that nothing 
                                was movable (due to the adhesions), and I worked the erection down 
                                until it was flaccid, and as this was good fun, I simply continued 
                                manipulating without any erection - and shortly afterwards ejaculated.</P>
                              <P>The next erection was in all probability on the following night, 
                                when I was lying in bed and the lights were out. On this occasion, 
                                I peeled back the adhesions. They were stuck evenly and it was like 
                                peeling off elastoplast, it was painful but intriguing. Then, all at 
                                once, the phimotic ring of a relative phimosis scraped unlubricated 
                                over the coronal ridge, latched behind the glans for a split second, 
                                (creating a spring mechanism with the frenulum breve); and then shot 
                                forward again.</P>
                              <P>I held my phallus in panic thinking I'd done myself a permanent 
                                damage: I'd obviously done something which I shouldn't have done! This 
                                had been an experience like putting your hand in fire, or rather, more 
                                like an electric shock - I had learnt without any shadow of doubt, 
                                that my foreskin was not meant to be retracted. </P>
                              <P>I forgot (repressed) this frightening experience. School and family doctors put me through every required check, I was certified 100% healthy and normal. </P>
                              <P>Throughout at least the first two years after puberty, I masturbated 
                                in the flaccid state, and this was the foundation of my own experience 
                                of my male body. Though soft masturbation is often thought to be impossible 
                                it is not a total rarity: though reported in old age, it was the reports 
                                during adolescence and one medical study on the curious masturbation 
                                methods used by men with phimosis from <A HREF="../medicus/beauge.html#start">Beauge</A>, 
                                which gave me the extra courage needed to start writing this diary.</P>
                              <P><B>Wet Dreams</B><BR>
                                For as long as I can remember, and probably every night, I would half 
                                wake up with a dream time erection. My automatic reaction was to hold 
                                this firmly to suppress it. As the erection subsided, I'd return to 
                                sleep. The process took maybe 15 seconds, a sleepy semi conscious experience 
                                which I grew accustomed to and could recall when waking. This behaviour 
                                precluded any spontaneous wet dreams.</P>
                              <P><B>&quot;Normal&quot; Masturbation</B><BR>
                                I must have been around 13 or 14 when I discovered that I could also 
                                masturbate &quot;normally&quot;. On these occasions, I didn't grasp 
                                my erect penis, I held it at finger length between my finger tips and 
                                thumb.</P>
                              <P>As I neared full erection, I started making quick pulls at the end 
                                of the foreskin to keep it forward, I was only dimly aware of this 
                                pulling sensation. It was a very quick automatic action which slowly 
                                became more regular until, previous to ejaculation, every two strokes 
                                I would quickly pinch and pull on the foreskin, to keep it forward; 
                                this happened as part of one continuous motion. I had been largely 
                                unaware of this process for around thirty years. It had become so natural, 
                                that in the period of time before my operation I was able to observe 
                                with some amazement the habit which had developed.</P>
                              <P><B>Love Making </B><BR>
I was emotionally very fit, happy, open hearted and good looking, and 
my first sexual relationships started at age 15. The first two were 
foiled on penetration. Particularly entertaining was trying to use 
a condom for the first time. Though this may be a precarious manoeuvre 
for the normal youth, consider the extra practice needed by those who 
must put the condom on while holding the foreskin forward, ... I wonder 
if any other boy has had the experience of the condom flying a good 
few feet across the room, or if this was my spring mechanism in action. </P>
                              <P>With my third girl friend after extended practice together, I succeeded 
                                in penetrating the gates of heaven by kneeling and holding my foreskin 
                                forward and guiding the phallus into her, a procedure which took both 
                                hands and an amount of acrobatic ability. I felt very pleased with 
                                myself and celebrated this successful initiation process and realised 
                                the secrets of manhood, ... and reinforced my rather suspect behavioural 
                                patterns.</P>
                              <P>It is generally considered impossible, during intercourse, for a 
                                man to control the size of his erection. I maintain that the fear of 
                                a potential pain exerts a predominant influence and that this can teach 
                                specific and even unnatural behaviour.</P>
                              <P>The fullest erection I could experience was by pulling the foreskin 
                                forward, this also allowed me to use &quot;the floppy bit&quot; (the 
                                overhang) as a tickler, (very enjoyable for both!) ... Making love 
                                was easier when I was not fully erect. (This was another fact which 
                                I only half recognised and was uncomfortably guilty about).</P>
                              <P>With later girl friends I experimented within the bounds of my limitation, 
                                grew somewhat acrobatic, but I always needed to hold the foreskin forward. 
                                I can only remember isolated moments when I 
                                was erect, inside a lover, and these were cuddle moments, holding her with both my hands, 
                                but without any pumping movement.</P>
                              <P><B>Untouchable</B><BR>
                                When my girl friends held my phallus I always lost my erection. There 
                                was one exception to this and she used to pull the foreskin forward 
                                (i.e, away from the problem area). When once she tried to hold the 
                                phallus I lost my erection, she was disappointed and I had to explain, 
                                as always, "Yeah that always happens".</P>
                              <P>Regardless of the love and trust in a relationship, when such a 
                                problem is unconscious there is bound to be a degree of anxiety about 
                                one's phallus being touched. Controlling my erection with my own hands, 
                                was indeed a most appropriate and natural response to my circumstances 
                                and this behavioural response was the expression of my sexuality.</P>
                              <P>I experimented twice with men but this also revealed nothing due 
                                to losing my erection when held - (There was no thought of comparison and also the lights were 
                                out).</P>

                              <P><B>Emotional Health and Adaptability</B><BR>
                                I believe it was my basic emotional and psychological health which 
                                led me to sleeping and cuddling with a wonderful variety of women. 
                                Often these relationships were not of a sexual nature, however among 
                                them were around thirty sexual adventures, of which around ten were 
                                non starters, but around ten lasted over six months.</P>
                              <P>The intimacy of melting in love by cuddling was an experience which 
                                often left me feeling confirmed as a person, and I am certainly not 
                                complaining about this. Within the bounds of my possibilities, I was 
                                experimental enough to have enjoyed a relatively enviable amount of 
                                intimate female sensuality. With a few of my girl friends the erotic 
                                fun lasted regularly three hours.</P>
                              <P>Some people may now be asking what on earth the problem was. When 
                                we compare my &quot;success rate&quot; to any number of men with emotional 
                                problems, then it is clear I &quot;scored&quot; relatively well . . 
                                . What I'm complaining about is among all the hundreds of other complicated 
                                (emotional and psychological) influences which confuse relationships 
                                . . . could there be anything else so simple?, obvious?, preventable? 
                                . . . and so completely ignored by our culture?</P>
                              <P>As a teenager there was obviously no significant or severe emotional 
                                or psychological problem. It is very probable that if I hadn't have 
                                been so open emotionally with cuddling etc., I would never have so 
                                clearly noticed my sexual limitations. The type of sexual intimacy 
                                I experienced, was literally &quot;conditioned&quot;.</P>
                              <P>Added to this was the guilt and embarrassment, wondering why I masturbated 
                                soft, wondering if I'd ever grow out of it, slowly coming to terms with 
  &quot;my&quot; sexuality ... Every girl friend, and this was especially 
                                traumatic with those who I loved, I thought this cant be the right 
                                one, because I was convinced that the right one would surely resolve all my sexual fears.</P>
                              <P>I could describe more of the tendencies I developed in intimate 
                                relationships, but I do cherish these times and do not believe that 
                                any further example would convince the sceptic. My general argument 
                                is in <A HREF="../../passages.html#start">&quot;The Passages to Manhood&quot;</A>.</P>

                                It was partly because of reading that herpes could be cured by circumcision, 
                                and partly in my never ending search for ideas about what could be 
                                wrong with my sexual identity and behaviour, that at the age of twenty 
                                eight I consulted the literature on circumcision, ...</P>
                              <P>I remember being a little surprised that the first two books I looked 
                                in on male sexuality said nothing on the subject. The third gave the 
                                classical medical description that: circumcision is indicated when 
                                the foreskin cannot be retracted without pain or difficulty (with the 
                                classical omissions of the fact that this applies to both the flaccid 
                                and erect states or that often when erect the foreskin remains retracted 
                                and rarely a mention of the frenulum). I checked myself, when flaccid 
                                and there was no problem: I thought maybe it refers to being erect. 
                                On this occasion, because the area was lubricated the foreskin retracted 
                                without any pain or difficulty... and naturally sprang forward again!</P>
                              <P>It required far clearer information than this, to break the belief 
                                (which had been established over a period of 17 post puberty years), 
                                that I was normal and in good health. The idea that my condition was 
                                a healthy one was confirmed by the traditional medical description: 
                                Yes! I was able to retract the foreskin without pain or difficulty,... 
                                but I didn't wish to do this... and I certainly wouldn't ever dream 
                                of holding it retracted, especially when erect!.</P>
                              <P><B>Parents</B><BR>
                                Since I had been a youth I had felt uneasy about my sexuality. Our 
                                cultural understanding, and the best professional advice, was and still 
                                is, that such problems are always the result of upbringing and environment. 
                                Thus I spent around 25 years post puberty, questioning what on earth 
                                it could be in my upbringing which had caused such problems in my sexual 
                                behaviour and attitudes.</P>
                              <P>My parents didn't beat me, they didn't lie, they are normal to good 
                                human beings, they fed me three times a day, helped me with my homework, 
                                kept me in after ten, .. and did exactly what our culture wants good 
                                parents to do and naturally took me to all the prescribed early medical 
                                checks. ... I doubt if an upbringing could be more culturally acceptable 
                                than that which I received.</P>
                              <P>However, because of our modern psychological understanding of sexual 
                                problems, I believed my parents must be to blame. I attempted for years 
                                to come to terms with this, eventually I &quot;forgave&quot; them by 
                                accepting that even if they had subverted my sexuality they had given 
                                me enough love and trust to enjoy emotional relationships with the 
                                opposite sex, and thus I really wasn't so badly off in comparison to 
                                most of the other men who I knew.</P>
                              <P>During my thirties, I visited two psychologists and presented the 
                                symptoms of soft masturbation and waking up just before a wet dream 
                                and quelling the erection. Both suggested deep rooted childhood problems, 
                                neither of these mentioned avoidance of potential pain from foreskin 
                                conditions. How could they have been expected to? Even the experts in psychosexual 
                                research who I have consulted during the past three years since my 
                                discovery, have rejected the ideas. </P>
                              <P>Psychologists are firmly 
                                of the opinion that adult sexual problems are always based on environmental 
                                and parental problems ,... I used to believe this as well ... </P>
                              <P>Whatever influences there were from my parents which may have inhibited my sexuality - the influence of pain from infant adhesions 
                                during the first 11 years of life is a far more basic influence. It is clear that psychologists and sexual researchers have never even considered this. </P>
                              <P><B>EARLY LEARNING - A Resum&eacute;</B> (Added in 1999 and is it 
                                relevant?)<BR>
                                Against the background of the two primary behaviour patterns, (the 
                                soft masturbation and quelling my night time erections), any subsequent 
                                disorientation in my sexuality seems pretty logical. So let's go back 
                                a step further, from the ease with which these two habits became established 
                                it is obvious that they had developed previous to puberty and possibly 
                                even in infancy. It is clear that the frightening experience with my 
                                condition at puberty confirmed these pre puberty behaviour patterns, 
                                the question is why did these behaviour patterns start, what was their 
                                origin?</P>
                              <P>Those of a psychological leaning might again suspect that environmental 
                                parental or educational factors played a part, so lets consider the 
                                possibilities and implications.</P>
                              <P>Firstly yes, there is an almost complete unawareness and lack of 
                                education on problem foreskins. The fact that foreskins only work if 
                                they retract is not recognised as one the facts of life ... it should 
                                be ... Even these days parents themselves receive no adequate education 
                                on foreskin conditions, how can they be expected to care for their 
                              sons?</P>
                              <P>                                But this lack of education is not the essential problem, .... if my 
                                parents or culture had told me that the foreskin should comfortably 
                                retract, knowing this in itself would not have changed my physical 
                                condition. I would suggest if education is needed then surely firstly the medical profession need to research this and understand it.</P>
                              <P>Regarding environmental or parental influences, it is very easy 
                                to find all sorts of funny quirks in ones own childhood once you start 
                                looking <BR>
                                We could imagine that my Mum was embarrassed by my infant erections, 
                                she may have had me always in nappies, and it is even possible that 
                                she stopped me playing with myself. Possibly most feasible would be 
                                an interpretation along the lines of the soft masturbation being a 
                                subconscious response to my mother's embarrassment and simply in order 
                                to please her I may have learnt to quell my erections and enjoy myself 
                                in secret. But where would I have learnt to quell my night time erections? 
                                My Mum maintained no supervision over my private sphere and after the 
                                age of 2 or 3 she would in all probability only have seen my erections 
                                during bath times.
                              <P>From my ability to be open emotionally, and from the integrity and 
                                love which I was able to enjoy and to a large extent establish in my 
                                relationships, it seems highly unlikely that there was any significant 
                                parental problem which inhibited me emotionally or psychologically. 
                                A healthy basis for manhood certainly had a fair chance of developing.
                              <P>On the other hand, it is undeniably true that from birth through early infancy 
                                until puberty, during every subconscious erection every time I tried to move my 
                                foreskin, the infant adhesions caused pain, ... and similar to twistingyour own arm or hitting your own head, every healthy non-masochistic pre-puberty boy, learns to avoid pain.

                                The initial and the basic stimulus for my behaviour must be seen as <A HREF="../../early-learning.html#start">the &quot;natural&quot; pain 
                                  from infant adhesions.</A> The basic inhibition must be seen as avoidance of a potential anatomical 
                                pain; any lack of appropriate preventative measures from my mother 
                                can only be secondary.</P>

                                I was amazed by the number of psychologists who wished to put the blame on my parents (&quot;its not a question of  blame, we only want to help you understand the causes&quot;)</P>
                              <P>Books on the first years of a 
                                child's life are full of ideas on Oedipal and anal stages, but they 
                                miss out any consideration of the relationship between an infant boy's 
                                erections and the development of his sexuality!</P>
                              <P>The omission of research on this aspect of early male body/touch 
                                self experiment and behaviour patterns is astounding, ... The effects 
                                of pain from infant adhesions have (to my knowledge) never been questioned 
                                by medical researchers.</P>
                              <P>It is clear that psychologists specialising in sexual research 
                                have no awareness of any of the more obvious effects of foreskin 
                                conditions, e.g. they are unaware how a partial phimosis hinders intercourse or they 
                                imagine that frenulum breve pulls the glans downwards <A HREF="../xtras/refs.html#ref93">(93)</A>. 
                                One psychologist had seen many men who complained of foreskin 
                                conditions and he said he always considered them to be perceptual problems <A HREF="../xtras/refs.html#ref61">(61)</A>. </P>
                              <P>I would argue the essential responsibility for this problem rests 
                                not with my parents but with modern psychology, for confirming the taboos 
                                in our cultural education and attitudes, by sustaining the myth that 
                                all adult sexual problems stem from parents, environment and education.</P>

                                research, I have very recently uncovered a number of veterinary studies 
                                which clearly recognise that sexual dysfunction due to physical malformations 
                                are a fairly common occurrence among bulls, boars, cats and dogs, - 
                                Ah! ... since the development of psychology, the human being must have

                                <B>Discovery</B> - July 1994, age 43<BR>
No one has ever asked me &quot;How did you eventually discover?&quot; 
I consider it a far more interesting question than the usually asked: 
&quot;Why did it take you so long to discover?&quot;
                              <P>Over the years I had been involved in a long process of different 
                                directions of enquiry into my sexuality. The final point of this last 
                                phase was crucial, and I believe a very important general lesson in 
                                life: - The answers are easy - its getting the questions right which 
                                is the tricky part!</P>
                              <P>I had reached a point where it was useless to repeatedly think through 
                                everything which appeared logical and possible. There must always be 
                                new possibilities, there is no such thing as an unsolvable problem. 
                                Thus, I rationally decided to start considering illogical and impossible 
                                questions . . . &quot;<I>maybe its something anatomical</I>?&quot; . . two weeks later 
                                I remembered the first traumatic experiences with erections at the beginning of puberty and had the answer.</P>
                              <P><B><A NAME="afterwards"></A>Afterwards</B><BR>
                                The subconscious problem which had influenced my entire post puberty 
                                development, and the main congenital foreskin inhibition (the frenulum) 
                                was removed at the age of 43. I then enjoyed the most amazing erections. 
                                Not only could I see the glans, and because of the diversity of skin 
                                surfaces the phallus looked far more interesting, but also I measured 
                                2cms. extra in length. Within the first ten erections, the coronal 
                                ridge had also clearly started to swell out.</P>
                              <P>I was amazed, this was truly a &quot;self&quot; revelation, this 
                                hidden part of my manhood had been discovered, recognised, confirmed, 
                                and celebrated. There was no bitterness at life, I was simply astounded, 
                                I wept tears of release as I recognised my potential manhood, and in 
                                understanding this, I felt made "whole".</P>
                              <P>I stopped masturbating soft - it just seemed pointless. It is interesting 
                                to note the psychological change after the op. this was the first time 
                                the erect penis started figuring in my fantasy, Ok so the libido was 
                                strong, but so was the erection - it took around a month before my 
                                fixated sexuality had matured, so that I became interested in ideas 
                                of intercourse or fellatio</P>
                              <P><B>Circumcision?</B><BR>
                                It was clear to me that our culture and the medical profession did 
                                not understand phimosis and the frenulum, their nature and their possible 
                                effects. The phimosis was not visible when flaccid, and so this was 
                                no real problem, (it was often referred to as a cosmetic problem). 
                                I briefly considered the possibility of having a circumcision from 
                                so called &quot;free choice&quot;.</P>
                              <P>My experience had proved the success of self experiment and so I 
                                decided to find out for myself the exact nature of this "phimosis", 
                                this constriction which is only vaguely described in any of the literature.</P>
                              <P><A NAME="ouch"></A>I discovered a thin band of gristly skin. By 
                                retracting the foreskin quite firmly, to spread out this thin band 
                                of gristle as wide as possible, I was able to see the nature of the 
                                problem quite clearly. This is fully described under the section on <A HREF="../../phimosis_research.html#start">Phimosis Research</A>. 
                                It became clear to me that a normal circumcision would be a rather 
                                inaccurate cure for this condition. However, I strongly and firmly 
                                advise no one to repeat any experiments which stretch the foreskin 
                                fully backwards during a full erection.</P>
                              <P><B>Kipling's Initiation</B><BR>
                                I believe to some extent, one could compare my situation to a leg being 
                                taken out of plaster after a number of years. It requires gentle therapeutic 
                                exercise. It had been on about the thirtieth fully expanded erection 
                                after the operation that I had made the examination involving the extremely 
                                strong retraction. The examination had lasted approximately five minutes 
                                and it must have had some sort of decompressing effect on the erectile 
                                tissue. Afterwards, I continued masturbating. A few seconds later, 
                                something shot with an intense pain internally through one side of 
                                the phallus.</P>
                              <P>I was shocked, even traumatised, I held myself for consolation and 
                                hoped the pains would go away. They didn't</P>
                              <P>So, this really put the lid on the soup: first I have a foreskin 
                                problem which is a delusion, it is only logical that this should be 
                                followed by pains which are imaginary. The pains were diagnosed as 
                                psychosomatic, and urologists referred me to psychologists.</P>
                              <P>It seemed that until a psychologist would give me the backing on 
                                the effects of frenulum breve and relative phimosis for over thirty 
                                active sexual years; the urologists wouldn't start to take my case 
                                seriously and consider what could have gone wrong. The psychologists 
                                referred me to the experts on sexual psychology - and the experts (as 
                                already mentioned) are convinced that such problems are parental.</P>
                              <P>It is something of a challenge not to get overwhelmed by the situation 
                                ... trying to keep my head, when everyone around is sure I've lost 
                                it, I am reminded of Kipling's initiation in &quot;If&quot;: &quot; 
                                ... And then my son you'll be a man&quot;.</P>
                              <P>To argue I'm correct on both points, is the certain proof for most 
                                people that I'm wrong on both points. There are similarities between 
                                my previous foreskin problem and my present symptoms: both involve 
                                genital pain, both have psychological aspects, (as can be expected); 
                                both have been taboo subjects for centuries; both are unstudied - but 
                                here the similarity stops.</P>
                              <P>Atypical penis fractures and nerve ruptures are unstudied because 
                                they involve internal and very subtle functions and the doctors have 
                                only had the technology to study them recently. Foreskin conditions 
                                are part of the external body, and I bet my bottom dollar that even 
                                our primitive ancestors had recognised the problems (and the possible 
                                problems) and treated them (<A HREF="../../origins.html#start">by introducing 
                                  routine circumcision</A>).</P>
                              <P>I believe in myself. I know that what I say is real and true (and 
                                correct). And, I do hope and pray that the great celestial hand will 
                                continue to reach down and tickle me under the chin, ... (worry is 
                                probably a good modern word for the devil).</P>
                              <P>And I`ll cut it at that point, this is where the original version 
                                ended (1996).
                              <P>-<A HREF="http://members.lycos.co.uk/nervefracture/" TARGET="_blank"> it seems a nerve has ripped, probably a form of sports injury</A> walking often hurts, and sex is 
                                impossible, ... I put up a couple of pages on my <A HREF="http://members.lycos.co.uk/nervefracture/" TARGET="_blank">post operation pains</A>, 
                                6 or 7 men contacted me (by year 2000 this was over a hundred men) with similar problems, but none had anything 
                                to do with foreskin conditions. So it seems rare and coincidental 
                                that I have had two genital problems neither of which the doctors understand. 
                              <P>Thanks for reading <BR>

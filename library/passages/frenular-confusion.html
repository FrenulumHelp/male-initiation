        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

  >Enjoyed your informative website greatly. I am a 27-year old who experiences <BR>
  >difficulty in retracting my foreskin, but I'm not sure if the phimotic 
                                ring <BR>
  >you describe exists. The problem seems to lie more in the frenulum, 
                                which <BR>
  >does not seem to allow the foreskin on the underside of the penis 
                                to pull <BR>
  >back as far as that on the topside. The frenulum is connected not 
                                so much at <BR>
  >the base of the head (as pictures seem to indicate) but more towards 
                                the tip <BR>
  >of the penis. I do not experience much difficulty pulling the foreskin 
                                back <BR>
  >when flaccid, but it's near-impossible when erect. It hurts a hell 
                                of a lot, <BR>
  >to say the least. Any insights into this you might offer would be <BR>
  >appreciated. <BR>
                                Thanks.

                                your self diagnosis is accurate you have frenulum breve, 
                              <P>most pics and most frenulums do join at base of the glans a picture 
                                of one joining at the tip of the penis may be helpful for the general 
                                information if you`ve got a web cam, and could endure the pain while 
                                retracting for a quick shot, ... before getting an op.<BR>

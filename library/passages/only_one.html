        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

<TD> <B>WHAT A RELIEF! I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE!<BR>
I think I suffer from Phimosis. Help!</B> 
<P>forum letter 217 
<P> Hello all,<BR>
What a relief to have found your site! I would appreciate very much 
any help you could all give me, or perhaps refer me to another source 
of advice for my problem. Thank you in advance for spending the time 
considering my problem. 
<P> I am a 32 year old male. I have a 6" penis. Since a child I have 
had an incredibly tight foreskin. 
<P>When my penis is flaccid my foreskin covers my penis completely 
and comfortably. In the flaccid state I can withdraw the foreskin completely 
to reveal the head with no problems, and often do for hygiene purposes 
etc. 
<P>When my penis is fully erect I can only reveal about 10% of the 
head before the foreskin tightens too much. If I try to force the foreskin 
back in an errect state my penis/head becomes almost unbearably painful, 
and sex in this condition is agony.<BR>
With my penis semi hard I am able to withdraw the foreskin back to 
the base of the head, if I then progress to full erection with the 
foreskin behind my head, the foreskin constricts to an extent that 
my head becomes deep purple as the blood flow is being constricted. 
I can have some sex like this but unless I have abstained form sex 
for weeks, I can only tolerate a few minuets of sex before the pain 
overrides any pleasure. Whenever I have done this the foreskin gets 
slightly stuck behind my head, but not in an unconfortable way, and 
will take a few days before returning to normal. 
<P> After all these years my head has become incredibly sensitive due 
to the lack of exposure and the whole thing is affecting my sex life 
adversely, as I am very unconfident about being able to have pleasurable 
sex, which in turn has limited the opportunities and pleasure I can 
experience. 
<P> I have been to my local GP (doctor) for advice who very quickly 
told me that circumcision was the only answer. I do not think this 
is right as everything I have read about circumcision seems very negative 
and it does seem such an extreme solution.<BR>
Finally I began trawling the web and found you guys and the Tripod 
(<A HREF="file:///C|/welcome.html#start">now: Male Initiation.net</A>) & 
Cirp sites.<BR>
I read about Michel Beauge and began to hope there was a solution other 
than surgery.<BR>
Having absorbed about as much as I can from the web I would like to 
try stretching as a remedy, but despite all the articles on it I am 
still a little uncertain how to go about stretching my foreskin. 
<P>Should I do it when flaccid, or erect?<BR>
How long should before I see some results?<BR>
Should I use Astro Glide, and if so how easy is it to obtain in the 
UK? (Over the counter at a chemsit?)<BR>
What technique is best?- When masterbating I always keep my foreskin 
over my head, and have never had any problems ejaculating. Mr Beauge 
mentions adopting a different technique when masterbating. Does anyone 
know what this technique is?<BR>
I have just read Roxane mention Topical Sterod Cream. <BR>
Can this help in an adult? How would one obtain it in the UK? 
<P> Sorry for all the questions, I am just desperate to find a solution 
I can live with. Many thanks- Ed Recio.<BR>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"> Beauge technique - Ed and any others who may be interested 
- it seems to be teaching a man with phimosis, who is perhaps also 
using a topical steroid, to masturbate gently drawing the foreskin 
back, instead of keeping the head covered. It takes a while, because 
a man has to learn 'pleasure' through this means of masturbating rather 
than a method he may be more used to. And again, it's so important 
to avoid tears and ripping and any form of roughness. Gentleness is 
of the essence. And you don't want to get the foreskin stuck behind 
the head! (paraphimosis) 
<P ALIGN="LEFT"> Once the foreskin is loose enough to slide back and 
forth easily, phimosis and painful sex should be a thing of the past. 
But it takes time, and you could possibly help it along by using a 
topical steroid. Perhaps three to four weeks?

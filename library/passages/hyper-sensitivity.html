        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P>Hi. <BR>
                                I only recently found out i have Phimosis, by looking on the health 
                                pages on Yahoo! I'm 24, and all this time, i thought my condition was 
                                normal, i didn't think the foreskin was supposed to retract. So, when 
                                i found out, i was less than joyous. :-) But, that was about 4 weeks 
                                ago, and after using the stretching technique, i can now retract my 
                                foreskin over the head of my penis, it is painful (slightly) when fully 
                                erect, but i'm sure that will get better as i keep stretching, after 
                                all 4 weeks isn't long, and >from what i've read, it usually takes 
                                nearly half a year before people get as far as i have. But, what really 
                                does upset me, is, now that i can retract my foreskin, and expose the 
                                glans, i've found out that the glans is HYPER-sensitive. And i can 
                                barely touch it, i've looked up many documents on the subject of phimosis, 
                                but nothing i've found mentions this, so i'm guessing it's abnormal. 
                                I usually wouldn't write this sort of email, but there is no way i 
                                would go to my local doctor about this, and i don't know anyone else 
                                with the condition, so i found your pages, and here i am. All i want 
                                to know is...</P>
                              <P>Is it normal for this to happen after finally gaining retraction? 
                                - if so, will it get less sensitive? Is there any way to speed this 
                                up?</P>
                              <P>Thanx in advance, for taking the time to answer my questions. </P>

                              <P>where have you read this,? </P>
                              <P>Yes it is normal to be sensitive, but usually not so "hyper sensitive"</P>
                              <P>> - if so, will it get less sensitive? </P>
                              <P>yes over time quite quickly it settles down, - but some men have 
                                very sensitive glans others not at all, we are very very varied in 
                                our genital sensitivity </P>
                              <P>>Is there any way to speed this up?</P>
                              <P>interesting question, if you wanted a quick temporary method try 
                                an aneasthetic cream, they make it numb, ... as a permanent method, 
                                ? *thinks* you need a cock bath .. :-) ... (Nescafe jar, full of warm 
                                water insert cock and hang loose for ten minutes ... we need a secret 
                                ingredient, there must be something, but I have no idea what - how 
                                does one speed up keratinisation i.e. hardening up the glans, I believe 
                                that the most sensible may be to bathe your glans in your own fresh 
                                urine,... for further stimulating discussions on the subject I would 
                                suggest you check out and write to us on the mailing list or Forum<BR>

                              <P>good luck,... if you find the secret ingredient please tell me <BR>

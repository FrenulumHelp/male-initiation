        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P>... after my recent visit to a urologist, it's clear I have phimosis 
                                (I am 24). The extent of my problem is such that I once had the foreskin 
                                retracted (with pain) while in the shower, but backed out of more recent 
                                attempts. I've never had intercourse due to the difficulty this causes.</P>
                              <P>The doctor prescribed a half-strength steroid cream, "Celestone-V 
                                (betamethasone valerate equivalent to betamethasone 0.5 mg/g)", followed 
                                by a stronger cream if this doesn't work within 6 weeks, followed by 
                                circumcision if that fails.</P>
                              <P>I was interested to read "Dave's" experience with a hydrocortisone 
                                cream: "All this did was burst capillaries under the skin and made 
                                things worse." I had the same thought yesterday upon my first application, 
                                as the skin seems to be very thin around the blood vessels I can see, 
                                and they are hard to avoid in a thorough application. It seems only 
                                logical that if the cream is to have any effect at all on the foreskin, 
                                the thinnest skin will be the first to weaken. Also, Paul writes of 
                                'adverse effects' of topical creams, which has me wondering.</P>
                              <P>So now my dilemma is what to do? Should I continue with the cream 
                                and expect the veins to burst? Or should I hold off and try stretching 
                                (which my urologist didn't mention), or cream and stretching? I'm not 
                                really looking for a temporary solution (although consummating my marriage 
                                would be nice).</P>
                              <P>------------------------------------<BR>
                                From my understanding creams are always used or more effective with 
                                some sort of gentle stretching ... the other questions rely on feedback 
                                and communication with others who are experimenting or asking questions 
                                ... partial circ. and dorsal slits should always be considered as options 
                                before a full circ. </P>
                              <P>>(although consummating my marriage would be nice).</P>
                              <P>Isn`t it ridiculous? how long you been married? of course it is 
                                this sort of info. which doesn`t come out much on the public systems, 
                                anyway youre not alone, so keep on trying, I reckon that before we 
                                are both pensioners the docs will have sorted out what to do ...</P>
                              <P>cheers<BR>

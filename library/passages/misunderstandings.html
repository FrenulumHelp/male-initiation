        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P>This is a long letter Michael, and I just stumble on problems in 
                                your understanding - all the anti circ sites have been misinforming 
                                you </P>
                              <P>> But those of us (a wee tiny minority) without this blessing of 
                                retractability </P>
                              <P>RS -the anti circ sites use only one study of statistics- that of 
                                Jacob Oster, if you check out my site you will find 8 studies on phimosis 
                                statistics, well theres probably about 20 all together but most are 
                                on infants, anyway recognise that this is more than a tiny minority 
                                - dont let the anti circs scare you into thinking you are a rarity,- 
                                you are not </P>
                              <P>> may possibly never entertained any notion of cleaning the phallus 
                                anywhere but on the outside. It's like one of the writers somewhere 
                                (maybe a differnt web site)wrote that he kind of likened what was visible 
                                (the reddish tip) within the hollow of a small foreskin opening, to 
                                one's eyeball. You don't go about washing the eyeball, and little more 
                                does one address the eyelids - the whole area being so delicate. </P>
                              <P>RS - I splash my eyes with cold water because it freshens me up 
                                and rinses my eyes, - the writer of the letter (I`m sure on another 
                                site) sounds like he has a bad phimosis and probably bad eye sight 
                                as well - </P>
                              <P>> I have fathered 3 boys (all circumcised I must say) so the procreative 
                                pur- pose of the old oak tree has not been in question, though there 
                                has always been minor discomfort in the initial stage of sex - trying 
                                to actually make it inside the vagina cause if the tightness at the 
                                penis tip. .. I often reflect on the similarities to my most early 
                                sexual unions because of this element of preventative-like restriction. 
                                .... and I get the distinct impression that this frenulum affair is 
                                quickly going to prevent my being able to pull back the foreskin much 
                                farther at all. It just really seems to tug up around there giving 
                                a pain to about the same degree as that from pressing a pretty sharp 
                                fingernail into the palm of your hand with a few pounds of force. It 
                                is this pain I feel in the first stage of sex. Pulling it tight like 
                                that makes evident what possibly is this infamous phimotic ring. It 
                                basically appears a little more "reinforced" right at the actual foreskin 
                                fold. It is about there too, under the extra pressure exerted in my 
                                little retraction attempt, that I see quite a lot of vein work. So 
                                my questions are now these:</P>
                              <P> > 1) Can these various cortisone creams, while somehow thinning 
                                out the foreskin, have a bad effect on the appreciable vascular network 
                                so closely involved ? </P>
                              <P>RS - less than surgery </P>
                              <P>> 2) Can these creams have any loosening or stretching effect on 
                                the frenulum ? </P>
                              <P>RS - possibly - I speculate yes </P>
                              <P>> 3) If a dorsal slit is perfomed to create a relief mechanism to 
                                help facilitate retraction, how is it possible to avoid compromising 
                                the frenulum (which I understand is so chocked full of pleasure nerves, 
                                and should be respected at all costs (For after all, we here in the 
                                states may feel entitled to the pursuit of happiness, you know).</P>
                              <P>RS -Too much anti circ rubbish .. a frenulum which is too short 
                                causes pain - yeah OK if you want all those extra sensitive nerves 
                                to cause pain then go ahead - be at the forefront of the next generation 
                                of uncircumcised Americans, who will all be infibulated complete with 
                                all their special protected (painful) nerves and thanks to the present 
                                info will believe this is normal - note: almost certainly your frenulum 
                                needs cutting - </P>
                              <P>> 4) Is the slit often made in the dorsal area since the resulting 
                                loose tissue flaps (ostensibly undesirable in appearance) would be 
                                less apparent when the penis hangs in its flaccid state ? </P>
                              <P>RS - no, the phimotic ring runs near the front on top, underneath 
                                it curves round and joins into the frenulum, this is why the cut is 
                                only effective on top, - but anyway the cut would be less visible made 
                                ventrally --- but you haven`t researched my site, and you have simply 
                                too many questions, and they are very fine points, it is mainly simply 
                                your choice, I and no-one answering here is a doctor, the only doctors 
                                involved in this subject are either passionately anti circ, or fanatically 
                                pro-circ.- find me someone unbiased to answer your questions and I`ll 
                                give him a page </P>
                              <P>Most of the answers are on my site, but anyway my site is actually 
                                not primarily concerned with adult treatment, - .... it is concerned 
                                with the ridiculous rumours which the anti pro circumcision debate 
                                generate and how this hinders education and kids being checked ...! </P>
                              <P>You seem to have adapted to your pain and difficulty without complaining, 
                                I say life could have been more fun for you ... when you agree and 
                                wanna help with future and general education then get in touch </P>
                              <P>Robin <A HREF="file:///C|/welcome.html#start">www.male-initiation.net</A> read my site - at least the welcome page </P>

                              <P> Written by michael at 22 Jul 2000 08:32:27: 
                              <P> I've pretty much read all the previous conversations and am trying 
                                to put it all together. Here we have the human penis that comes with 
                                this sort of pro- tective glove which for most fellows is retractable 
                                past the glans (head) of the penis, if it hasn't already been cut back 
                                for any along a wide gamut of cultural reasons. Those who retain this 
                                retractable skin I would guess have long since learned to dutifully 
                                carry out some form of regular cleaning operation. But those of us 
                                (a wee tiny minority) without this blessing of retractability may possibly 
                                never entertained any notion of cleaning the phallus anywhere but on 
                                the outside. It's like one of the writers somewhere (maybe a differnt 
                                web site)wrote that he kind of likened what was visible (the reddish 
                                tip) within the hollow of a small foreskin opening, to one's eyeball. 
                                You don't go about washing the eyeball, and little more does one address 
                                the eyelids - the whole area being so delicate. The inside tip of my 
                                penis seemed like something to be left alone - it didn't seem constructed 
                                to tamper with. I assummed that with normal exterior washing the rest 
                                would somehow naturally take care of itself (think of how the ear canal, 
                                eyes, and nose are to a large extent self cleaning);indeed I have never 
                                had infections in 42 years (chlorinated pool H20 helped during years 
                                of swimming helped?) 
                              <P>I have fathered 3 boys (all circumcised I must say) so the procreative 
                                pur- pose of the old oak tree has not been in question, though there 
                                has always been minor discomfort in the initial stage of sex - trying 
                                to actually make it inside the vagina cause if the tightness at the 
                                penis tip. But once my wife's own tightness gives way and lubrication 
                                begins then we are good to go (heh,heh) I often reflect on the similarities 
                                to my most early sexual unions because of this element of preventative-like 
                                restriction. It's one of the things that keeps me young of mind in 
                                a strange way. But now I am kind of at a stage where I want to experience 
                                what added joys and pleasure may be experienced with a fully exposed 
                                glans - that's right folks I am looking forward to going for it !! 
                                This brings me finally (almost)to my questions. I have experimented 
                                somewhat, and can manage to pull the foreskin back only far enough 
                                to expose a structure about half the tip of your little finger - that's 
                                it - without any pain. At that point there seems to be my first clue 
                                about this frenulum that is supposed to attach the foreskin to some 
                                portion of the glans (to the sulcus?). There seems to be a little ridge 
                                of skin involved right there at the tip and I get the distinct impression 
                                that this frenulum affair is quickly going to prevent my being able 
                                to pull back the foreskin much farther at all. It just really seems 
                                to tug up around there giving a pain to about the same degree as that 
                                from pressing a pretty sharp fingernail into the palm of your hand 
                                with a few pounds of force. It is this pain I feel in the first stage 
                                of sex. Pulling it tight like that makes evident what possibly is this 
                                infamous phimotic ring. It basically appears a little more "reinforced" 
                                right at the actual foreskin fold. It is about there too, under the 
                                extra pressure exerted in my little retraction attempt, that I see 
                                quite a lot of vein work. So my questions arenow these: 
                              <P> 1) Can these various cortisone creams, while somehow thinning out 
                                the foreskin, have a bad effect on the appreciable vascular network 
                                so closely involved ? 
                              <P>2) Can these creams have any loosening or stretching effect on the 
                                frenulum ? 
                              <P>3) If a dorsal slit is perfomed to create a relief mechanism to 
                                help facilitate retraction, how is it possible to avoid compromising 
                                the frenulum (which I understand is so chocked full of pleasure nerves, 
                                and should be respected at all costs (For after all, we here in the 
                                states may feel entitled to the pursuit of happiness, you know). 
                              <P>4) Is the slit often made in the dorsal area since the resulting 
                                loose tissue flaps (ostensibly undesirable in appearance) would be 
                                less apparent when the penis hangs in its flaccid state ? 
                              <P>5) Is it within the realm of common sense that the relief cut is 
                                normally made in a dorsal location so that if the frenulum is involved 
                                it can be snipped a bit there so that now all little flaps are simply 
                                in a single area. 
                              <P>6) What is that frenuplasty (I know my spelling is way off here 
                                but I can't go back to check the right way at his point) procedure? 
                                I mean is there some real room for minimalism here (where you can barely 
                                notice operative cuts etc.). Or some creativity in the snipping and 
                                stitching that may be involved? 
                              <P>7) Given the fact that the glans itself is covered with some kind 
                                of mucosal- like tissue, how do you get this helmet-like protuberance 
                                willing to exist in the cruel abrasive environment - open hair, rough 
                                clothes, etc. - for the first time in over 40 years ? 
                              <P>8) (6) and (7) having been asked, is there any possibility in this 
                                fantastic technologically miraculous age of ours to install a very 
                                thin micro-zipper so that one could unzip ones foreskin zipper either 
                                for sex or for washing than zip back up? Thus any flaps that may have 
                                been a bit unsightly can be justed zipped shut. Sorta keep the skin 
                                fully intact (have cake and eat it too, if you will) 
                              <P>9) Have any the visitors reading the dialogue in this section, had 
                                any experience, using cream and pull-back exercises, where some ripping 
                                or tearing of the skin occurred? Did you wait for more than a day to 
                                heal up before you tried again? (Or how long?) What about any scar 
                                tissue that could then develop? At what point does elasticity begin 
                                to be so compromised that diminishing returns ensue? 
                              <P>10) Is there any safe tool that a man can use to stretch the foreskin 
                                opening uniformly (around the the circumference) and gradually (over 
                                hours, days, weeks)? I thought I saw some such apparatus in my surfing. 
                                It definitely could make a lot of sense. Certainly there are various 
                                peoples about the world who practice various kind of skin stretching 
                                or hole expanding using some appliance over some appreciable length 
                                of time. 
                              <P> (!!) Hey thanks for everyone's time. Please answer what questions 
                                you can. I believe they are all pretty good ones - relevant and haven't 
                                really been raised before. I have visited and tried to deal with a 
                                few Urology groups here in the U.S. midwest and I am not really getting 
                                very straight answers. I hope to arm myself with enough good ideas 
                                so that I can deal with any of medical community proactively and effectively 
                                but tactfully as well. I had conjured up a few notions of documenting 
                                my efforts, in a way that could foster enlightenment. I did call the 
                                local paper at one point but they are not quite ready to bite. So please 
                                supply your best ideas, piecemeal or comprehensively in your responses 
                                which I very greatly appreciate, and look forward to applying towards 
                                the pleasures of lovemaking and providing a decent follow-up here in 
                                good time(Thanks).

                                and Veins written by michael at 22 Jul 2000 08:32:27: 
                              <P> Michael, it seems to me that you (and some of your midwestern urologist 
                                friends) are making what is essentially a fairly simple problem into 
                                something a lot more complicated than it needs to be. First off, your 
                                question about zippers reminds me of a story that was told on a man 
                                in Atlanta some years ago. He had married a Jewish lady and to please 
                                her had converted to her faith. There were two posh clubs in Atlanta, 
                                one with gentile members only, the other one with Jewish members only. 
                                The story was that at the time of his circumcision he had a zipper 
                                installed so that he could zip on his foreskin when he went to the 
                                gentile club, to which he already belonged, and zip it off when he 
                                went to the Jewish club, which he joined after his conversion. I met 
                                him once when he was quite old, but didn't ask him to confirm the story. 
                                (I seriously doubt that it's true.) 
                              <P>You ask about why the dorsal slit is where it is, and how it affects 
                                the frenulum. Placed at the top of the penis as it is, the slit does 
                                not affect the frenulum, which normally is located at the very bottom 
                                of the penis. You ask about the slit's affect on appearance, etc. The 
                                slit need not be very long as a rule, just long enough to relieve the 
                                tight foreskin so it can be easily retracted. I know a man born in 
                                Washington State who had such a tiny snippet made at the time of his 
                                birth. The result was that it was impossible to tell him from any other 
                                uncircumcised man, but his foreskin was totally free and easily retracted. 
                                Since you have lived 42 years without circumcision, it might be a bit 
                                of a shock to you to do it at this time, but it seems highly likely 
                                that a short dorsal slit could eliminate the tightness of the foreskin 
                                without having any other perceptible effect. Certainly there's no point 
                                in your putting up with uncomfortable sex any longer (and we haven't 
                                mentioned your long-suffering wife's right to having a clean phallus 
                                thrust into her vagina during sex!). 
                              <P>If you can find a conservative, sympathetic physician who isn't 
                                circumcision-happy but is willing to make a minimal slit at the top 
                                of your penis, you may eliminate all your problems in short order. 
                                The frenulum may not be involved at all; however, if it is found to 
                                be part of the problem, the conservative, sympathetic physician should 
                                be able to snip it with minimal trauma, followed by rapid recovery. 
                                Letters like yours make me wonder at how much some men have to put 
                                up with, and at the questionable help they sometimes receive from the 
                                medical profession. I wouldn't contact the newspapers about this at 
                                all; at best they may think you're some kind of nut instead of a citizen 
                                with a valid problem, which I accept that you are. I suggest you keep 
                                looking for a competent doctor who is willing to help you. There really 
                                are such people, and you can find one if you search diligently and 
                                are lucky! Best wishes, Bob.

        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P>I only recently discovered a reference to phimosis in an American 
                                publication, TOTAL SEX, published by Men's Fitness magazine. My former 
                                husband, with whom I've stayed on relatively good terms, was born in 
                                Scotland. We met at eighteen and married at nineteen. We divorced four 
                                years later. I've been struggling for years to understand the dysfunction 
                                we experienced. Having never seen an uncircumcised man before (or since), 
                                I put our difficulties down to this phenomenon. For the entire four 
                                years of our marriage, David suffered from what you described as 'long 
                                overhang'. I never did see the head of his penis as he had about an 
                                inch and a half of ragged loose skin that narrowed down to about half 
                                an inch in diameter. I never witnessed an 'erection' per se, and his 
                                only form of sexual performance was rigorous masturbation that took 
                                absolutely ages. Penetration was virtually impossible. If this wasn't 
                                phimosis I'd like to know how to define it. I've never broached the 
                                subject with him since our divorce but if it would help him to find 
                                some enjoyment in life by knowing what this is and how it is treatable 
                                I would sure like to give him that chance. We were so naive back then 
                                and I just assumed I didn't arouse him enough. I carried that emotional 
                                baggage around for years. But that, as they say is another story. Can 
                                you enlighten me at all? Thank you. 
                              <P>Dear ....<BR>
                                You've understood my site - this interpretation is probably correct, 
                                ... maybe for some other reason, he couldn't have erections... however 
                                I assume he had an anatomical problem with retraction, .... I developed 
                                similar habits, and there were a couple of American girls, who probably 
                                also wondered about this kinky Englishman, ... <A HREF="../../map.html#start">htttp://www.male-initiation.net/map.html </A>and click on "Diary of an Initiation" (in yellow) 
                              <P>On a practical level, it is not only phimosis which can inhibit 
                                the foreskin, frenulum breve can also do this. From the description 
                                of a "long overhang" I suggest this is frenulum breve. 
                              <P>I suspect because of their anatomical influences that generally 
                                a tight phimosis alone leads to a lack of interest in sex, whereas 
                                frenulum breve or a combination of fr. br. and phimosis leads to the 
                                kinky stuff. Whatever, the male foreskin can be inhibited by both and 
                                when the foreskin is inhibited then possibilities, appetite and behaviour 
                                are influenced. 
                              <P>Normally the uncircumcised man can retract his foreskin and expose 
                                the glans, a man with phimosis or frenulum breve cannot do this or 
                                it is uncomfortable and so he avoids doing it. 
                              <P>In Britain we are never checked, the pornography laws disallow pics 
                                of the erect penis, ... boys who avoid anatomical pain in their erection 
                                are likely to avoid a number of other situations ... thus "from innocence 
                                to ignorance" 
                              <P>I just had a letter from a mother of a kid with a painful foreskin 
                                condition, ... learning starts early .... this news might come as quite 
                                a shock to your old lover, ... I mean it involves a review of his life 
                                time beliefs that "I am normal" ... 
                              <P>Keep in touch, be nice to hear what happens<BR>

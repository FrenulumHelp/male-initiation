        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P>hi<BR>
                                i am an 22yr old male. </P>
                              <P>i have a problem with my foreskin that i hope someone can help me 
                                with at the end of my foreskin it is very tight and the opening isnt 
                                really big enough for the head of my penis to go through so i can retract 
                                it. </P>
                              <P>I can retract my foreskin so it is behind the head of my penis, 
                                but it takes a lot of effort to force it behind there. </P>
                              <P>Also if i happen to get an erection when my foreskin is behind the 
                                head of my penis it is painful and like the head of my penis is being 
  "strangled" </P>
                              <P>if i try to uriniate when it is in this state it hurts and not much 
                                urine will come out. </P>
                              <P>Sometimes it has taken me several hrs and much pain to get my foreskin 
                                back to its normal position after this, and if i have tried to urinate, 
                                when it finally goes back to its normal position urine comes out, i 
                                guess cause the pressure is released. </P>
                              <P>has anyone got a solution to this problem? </P>
                              <P>i am very scared of going to the doctor and i do not want to be 
                                circumcised.</P>
                              <P> I dont know if this will cause problems when having intercourse, 
                                because i am a virgin. </P>
                              <P>i can masturbate ok though </P>
                              <P>thanks </P>
                              <P>I feel here we see a fear of the unknown, as the initiate hesitates 
                                for months and years wondering whether the horrendous effects of his 
                                foreskin complex may possibly have an effect on intercourse, </P>
                              <P>Most of the answers are summarised on the welcome page --- check 
                                out phimosis and paraphimosis (and ways to control it), - yes I know 
                                theres a bit to read and understand and really the doctors should 
                                have taken care of it years ago, but then sigh - this is all part 
                                of being a man in the modern world ... (education/awareness is the 
                                best cure for ignorance) .. and if you learn a bit about betamethsone 
                                .. and then if you ask the doctor for some - he will probably thank 
                                you for making his days work easier </P>

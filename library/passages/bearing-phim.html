        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P>Hi there.. <BR>
                                Last night I was doing some research on circumsized / uncircumsized 
                                pensis's and I discovered that I have the condition called Phimosis... 
                                when I finally got the clinical name for my condition, I found your 
                                site. 
                              <P>I'm 22 years old, uncircumsized, and I saw in some pictures on a 
                                few sites that some men were able to retract their foreskin all the 
                                way behind the "head" of the penis. I've never been able to do that, 
                                and the few times that I tried, I experience pain... what is described 
                                on your site is exactly what I have. 
                              <P>I just thought I'd e-mail you in an attempt to get some additional 
                                info or advice on it. I don't want to become circumsized, mainly because 
                                of the pain that I think it will cause.... in addition, my fiance' 
                                doesn't want me to do it either. I can usually bear the pain of slight 
                                retraction during sex, but she knows it bothers me at times. I read 
                                on your site that the skin can be ripped as well. I'm lucky that it 
                                hasn't happened to me as yet. 
                              <P>Is there anything you can tell me in relation to this, I read about 
                                the creams and the stretching, the slitting of the foreskin, etc.. 
                                as far as you know, what would you recommend. Has anyone mailed you 
                                with similar scenarios before? I'm getting a little worried because 
                                I don't want to beleive its a serious problem. 
                              <P>Let me know what you think.. thanks for whatever input you can provide. 
                              <P>______________<BR>
                                I think you might have some success with stretching, ... 
                              <P>Beause yours is a childhood phimosis, (you say you could never retract 
                                it), ... then you should be able to stretch it, we have recently been 
                                researching this on ARC, and the 4 or 5 men I've advised in the last 
                                month, seem to fit the pattern, ... 
                              <P><A HREF="../../phimosis/stretching_lsa.html#start">http://www.male-initiation.net/stretching.html</A><BR>
                                is sort of a good start, but it seems stretching in showers (and thus 
                                steam?) might help ... 
                              <P>>Has anyone mailed you with similar scenarios before? <BR>
                                TONS otherwise I'd have never been able to get so far with research 
                                in the face of the ignorance which abounds on this subject. 
                              <P>>I'm getting a little worried because I don't want to beleive its 
                                a serious problem.<BR>
                                hummm I'm not going to get too inolved with answering this, you see 
                                if when you retract you experience pain, ... which you can just bear 
                                ... hummm ... ? ... the main consolation is theres possibly a very 
                                simple cure, and theres lots of other men like you.<BR>
                                Cheers<BR>

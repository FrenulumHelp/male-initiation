        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P>When my son was 2 years old he had balanitis, and I took him to 
                                his pediatrician who forcefully pulled back his foreskin and advised 
                                me to continue this practice. My husband did so twice but it seemed 
                                to cause my son so much pain that I insisted that we stop. I contacted 
                                the pediatrician again and he stood by his recommendation. We did not 
                                continue to pull the foreskin back however, because I found numerous 
                                sources which advised against it. My son is now almost 5 years old 
                                and I believe that his foreskin may be too tight for him to pull it 
                                back on his own. I have tried to encourage him to do so gradually but 
                                he says it hurts. I am worried that retracting the foreskin at age 
                                2 may have caused a true phimosis. How does one know if that is the 
                                case? I am actually afraid to go to another pediatrician because the 
                                one I went to is considered quite informed and he gave the wrong advice. 
                                What do you think? I would appreciate a reply as I am probably one 
                                of the only people in Kentucky who did not circumcise her son and I 
                                have no one to ask .</P>
                              <P> Thank you for answering my letter. I have already read everything 
                                on your site and after doing so, I feel somewhat better, but still 
                                it seems that by age 4 1/2 most boys have retractable foreskins. </P>
                              <P>I think my son experiences pain whether the penis is erect or flaccid 
                                if we attempt to push back the foreskin. He also says it hurts when 
                                his penis gets "happy" (erect), but I would say it might be a little 
                                uncomfortable, but it couldn't really be hurting that much or he would 
                                show more distress.</P>
                              <P>Since reading your info, I have encouraged him to pull forward on 
                                the foreskin and roll it between his fingers. I'm not sure why, but 
                                he says he is not going to "do the weenie thing." I have certainly 
                                never scolded him about self-manipulation, but as far as I know, he 
                                rarely does it.</P>
                              <P>There are no infections, and the balanitis he experienced at 2 was 
                                due to diapers I guess. That was the reason I took him to the pediatrician, 
                                and the pediatrician just forcfully pulled back the foreskin in the 
                                office and said, "His problem is that he is too tight." My son cried. 
                                The pediatrician told us to continue to do this at home, but I could 
                                not bring myself to do so even once. My husband did it twice. I wish 
                                I had never listened to the pediatrician because I felt it was wrong. 
                                You are correct when you say that most doctors in the states have never 
                                seen a foreskin. I called the local hospital for advice and they told 
                                me to just start pulling it back. This was the same avice I got from 
                                the pediatrician. </P>
                              <P>We are definitely in a minority. My entire family thinks I am crazy 
                                because I refused to circumcise my son. I have worried that maybe all 
                                around me were correct and I was wrong. I hope not.</P>
                              <P>I have examined him as much as I feel that I can without causing 
                                any pain. I feel bad enough about his earlier experience. I don't want 
                                to do that again. But it appears to me that the opening in the foreskin 
                                is too small. The opening is big enough for me to see part of the head 
                                of the penis, but not much. I have noticed though that the foreskin 
                                can be pulled forward very far away from the penis, and this causes 
                                no discomfort. One of the articles I read on your site said that the 
                                opening might at first appear as small as a pin hole but by the time 
                                the boy is 17 it would be big enough . That made me feel better, but 
                                should the foreskin be retractable at his age or can I relax about 
                                it and give it more time? I want to make sure that I do what is right 
                                for my son. I fear that if I take him to a pediatrician here they will 
                                either recommend forcfully pulling back on the foreskin, or worse and 
                                more likely, they will recommend that I have him circumcised now. </P>

                              <P>Notes: I think its crazy to tug around on baby boys foreskins and 
                                cause them pain, an adult would never cause themselves so much pain.. 
                                .... I argue against leaving an unretracted foreskins alone till the 
                                age of 17 This advice is given by many anti-circumcision sites. This 
                                figure comes from &Oslash;ster`s study which has been considerably 
                                misinterpreted. </P>

        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P>I am an Norwegian 45 years old male that as a child had a very narrow 
                                phimoses, that was compleetely cured by gradually streching. When I 
                                was 10 years old, my parents discovered the phimosis, which I actually 
                                had had from my early childhood, and brought me to a doctor that recomanded 
                                operation (circumcission or dorsal cleavage?). 
                              <P>Well, I got very angry, refused the operation, and actually showed 
                                That I was prepared to fight violently to avoid it. 
                              <P>Then I was taken to another doctor (actually a surgeon that really 
                                had some understanding of the problem). He recomanded that I gradually 
                                streched my foreskin dayly in order to solve the problem. He called 
                                my type of phimosis "soft". 
                              <P>That I did, and in three months the problem was completly solved. 
                              <P>Having my own experience in mind, I checked my sons penis for phimosis 
                                on regular intervals when he was young, regularly pulling in back, 
                                but without using force. I also instructed him to retract his foreskin 
                                and wash his penis. 
                              <P>When he was 12 years old I had not done this for some time, but 
                                thought it usefull to do it one more time. Then I discovered that his 
                                foreskin had become inflamed and he was developing a phimotic condition 
                                because of this. He had forgotten to pull his forskin back and wash 
                                it for a long time. 
                              <P>Well, I then smeard the tip of his penis with an antibacterial cream 
                                for some days, and pulled the foreskin gently back, some more each 
                                day. In some days the condition was reversed. I reinstructed him to 
                                pull back his foreskin every day and wash his penis. 
                              <P>Since then he has not had any problems. 
                              <P>My experiences has told me that it is important to check a boys 
                                penis in regular interwals, at least antill one can be sure the boy 
                                himself has developed a regular habit of doing this himself and was 
                                his penis. 
                              <P>My experience also tells me that a phimosis often is best treated 
                                with very simple methods, that can be done at home, either by the boy 
                                himself or a parent.

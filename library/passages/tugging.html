        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P>Dear Robin,<BR>
                                Today I was watching my husband pulling our son's foreskin, his delicate 
                                skin formed tiny tears and started bleeding. We were instructed to 
                                do this by our pediatrician. I was mortified, we argued. That is when 
                                I decided to look up foreskin on the internet. I came across your website, 
                                and am very happy to have found it. We have noticed our son naturally 
                                stretching his penis- we never knew why. Now we do. </P>
                              <P>We just want to thank you for voicing your opinions. Thank you for 
                                reaching out to others.</P>
                              <P>----------<BR>
                                Thanks for your letter, its ths sort of thing that makes my work worthwhile 
                                ...</P>
                              <P>>Today I was watching my husband pulling our son's foreskin in, 
                                his delicate skin <BR>
  >formed tiny tears and started bleeding. We were instructed to do this 
                                by our <BR>
  >pediatrician. I was mortified.<BR>
                              </P>
                              <P>So am I ---!!! natures_way.html and prevention.html are probably 
                                the central files for reference ... your son should maybe be encouraged 
                                to pull *forward* on his own foreskin - but maybe first just give him 
                                a break, do nothing for a few months - let him recover -</P>
                              <P>Such yanking painful methods are frequently advised, and then the 
                                normally gentle loving husband turns into a primitive monster. One 
                                father maintained that his son yelped but "a bit of pain never hurt 
                                anyone - he yowls when he goes to the dentist" - for some crazy reason 
                                (the macho image) grown men seem to feel that inflicting pain to their 
                                sons penis will make them better men ... I suspect this illogic wont 
                                effect any other aspect of your husbands care, but with penis-care 
                                he gets minus points with me. 
                              <P>If your son has any trouble when he's around 3 yrs. old then get 
                                in touch again .... </P>
                              <P>cheers<BR>

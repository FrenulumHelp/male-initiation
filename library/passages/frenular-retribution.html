        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                                before the operation: did anyone else ever masturbate you? . . No</P>
                              <P>I'm a 22 years'old French guy and I would like to thank you for 
                                yor web pages which have been of great information for me.</P>
                              <P>I have had sexual intercourse with my girl-friend for the past 3 
                                years and have experienced a series of problems to which I hardly found 
                                any help.</P>
                              <P>I have had other sexual experiences before I met my present girlfriend 
                                - I had not encountered problems.</P>
                              <P>Now that I have read all your materials, I now remember and recognize 
                                the symptoms of a frenulum breve: when I was masturbating as a teen, 
                                it was tight and if I pulled too much (maybe not too much for a normal 
                                man) my foreskin back, my glan would bend downward. My frenulum was 
                                always very tight but I considered it normal having nothing to compare 
                                with. Masturbating was a mix of thrill and slight pain, which I started 
                                to accentuate over the years : pleasure and pain, satisfaction and 
                                remorse/cupability - sometimes feeling that my penis was going to "break", 
                                to bleed as a punition for masturbating. I think I got used to it and 
                                it always remained easy to control pain as I was masturbating.</P>
                              <P> Penetration was a bit more complicated. I started to have regular, 
                                close-in-time sexual intercourse with my girlfriend... and maybe after 
                                one month my frenulum ripped during penetration...I was very ashamed 
                                and try to hide it...she noticed of course, the bed being full of blood...Going 
                                to a doctor never crossed my mind: first I thought I could never take 
                                down my pants in front of one, and I also thought that the only solution 
                                would be circumcision, which I did not want and was afraid of (it is 
                                still the case as I fear being mutilated). So I let cicatrisation go 
                                its way and after a few days of pains, it healed...My frenulum had 
                                lost a part of itself and it then looked as if it had been chopped. 
                                Some parts of skin were loose. I started to have sex again and it ripped 
                                again, this time maybe even more. The scenario repeated itself. It 
                                healed and my frenulum had got smaller. 3 or 4 months later it occured 
                                again.</P>
                              <P>A month after my third ripping I had a problem with the ring of 
                                my foreskin. It had lost elasticity and retracting the foreskin was 
                                getting painful even when flacid. I took the decision to go and see 
                                a doctor. I did not speak about my frenulum ripping because I thought 
                                I would look idiot not to have seen a doctor well before. He examined 
                                me and did not notice anything about my frenulum.What I feared to be 
                                a phimosis was a problem of mycosia which healed quickly thanks to 
                                some medicine.</P>
                              <P>I started asking questions myself about the ripping of my foreskin: 
                                maybe it was normal to rip this part of your penis (like the hymen 
                                for a women), that it should have occured well before and it was the 
                                proof of my lack of sexual experience. I thought for a time that I 
                                had not been told about something.</P>
                              <P> Today, when retracted, flacid or in erection, the lower part of 
                                what used to be the frenulum has disappeared (accros the three different 
                                rippings), then I have a tiny bit of skin which is still very tight. 
                                If retracted to the extreme when flacid , the glan still bends downward 
                                and it hurts.</P>
                              <P>I think I have get used to it whith time going by. I recently moved 
                                town and went to a new doctor for a cold. I felt at ease with him and 
                                told him that I had experienced a frenulum ripping. He told me it was 
                                normal and that it occured often, and that if it has healed then it 
                                is OK. He did not offer to take a look.</P>
                              <P>4 days ago, my frenulum ripped again, very slightly in fact because 
                                there is not much to rip, but still it has ripped. This is why I started 
                                to look for info. The only things I have found are your pages and pages 
                                from the dpt of sexology of the University of Montreal, Canada. Their 
                                position is that if it occurs and then heals, no need to see a doctor, 
                                nothing to worry about. I appreciate your position, because you take 
                                frenulum problems seriously, not like if it was a simple detail in 
                                any guy sexual life.</P>
                              <P>After reading your pages, I feel I was never informed about the 
                                condition and never properly examined by doctors I have met during 
                                my schooling. The years going by, I got used to the condition but I 
                                am now sure that this discomfort prevents me from an optimal sex life. 
                                Following the steps of your self-diagnosis (and following recent events), 
                                I think suffer from a form of frenulum breve which despite what it 
                                is said does not heal thanks to natural ripping. My frenulum, even 
                                after 4 rippings ( and truly speaking four mini traumas), is today 
                                still too tight.</P>
                              <P>Thanks again for your work which has helped me to reconsider my 
                                condition and at last to be convinced that if I am obsessed by my genitals, 
                                I have a reason for this.

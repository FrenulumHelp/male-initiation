        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P>I had a problem with my frenullum(however its spelt!). A month ago, 
                                i had painful sex but i got used to it and carried on. When we finished 
                                i went to clean up and i noticed my genital area was covered in....blood! 
                                I rushed to the batroom ands it was very painful but saw no sign where 
                                the blood was from. I had realised that piece of skin had torn, and 
                                now after 3 weeks all is well. It is no longer painfull and can be 
                                pulled back with ease. I had very painful times with this, so id be 
                                happy to help others in the similar situation. Gaz

                                it really hurt and in the end i had to ring soemone to find out what 
                                to do. I got it bac by pushing the head of my penis while pullin back 
                                my foreskin. Really I would like to know what the problem is?if there 
                                is one? and what I can do about it so that it wont hurt again. Any

                              <P>I am 20 years old and I've always had a tight forskin. As long as 
                                I can remember, I have had a problem. I cannot get my forskin over 
                                the head of my penis and recently my girlfriend has been suggesting 
                                that we have sex, but I keep putting her off because I don't know if 
                                you can have sex with your forskin forwards. Is it possible?! I don't 
                                want to put it off anymore cause she'll soon get the wrong idea and 
                                I'm too embrassed to talk about it with my girlfriend. Help!!! Is is 
                                possible for me to have sex with my forskin forwards? 
                              <P>RS. I feel here again we see the initiate hesitating with a fear 
                                of the unknown, his foreskin complex like every good problem <I>comfortably</I> repressed (probably resulting from years of fear about cirucumcision), 
                                has not read my site and has not yet heard of new miracle creams to 
                                end his torment.

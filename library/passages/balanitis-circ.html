        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                            <TD><P><B>BALANITIS and CIRCUMCISION</B>
                              <P>You mentioned somewhere that you are interested in input re experience 
                                following adult circ. I was cut in my early 20s following recurrent 
                                balanitis with corresponding yeast infection for my girlfriend. Creams 
                                didn't help over about 6-8 months. Finally, I agreed to the operation. 
                                Never had any problem since. I should note that I did have a frenulum 
                                breve that caused pain and bleeding for a couple of years but suffered 
                                through. The frenulum was essentially torn in two, centimetre by centimetre. 
                                It kept healing up, and by the time I was circumcised, it was already 
                                just a scar, if that makes sense. 
                              <P>My son is two and has Balanitis. The doctor has prescribed antibiotics. 
                                I'd concur that it looks bacterial, based on the swelling and pus discharging 
                                from the skin (externally). My conclusion is that the antibiotics will 
                                probably work, and we'll hopefully stop recurrence by emphasising hygiene. 
                                But, as he's my kin, skin very sensitive to soaps, etc., fungal balanitis 
                                and other conditions such as frenulum breve are likely to be problems 
                                that he may have to deal with in adulthood. Hopefully, I'll be able 
                                to discuss that with him at the time. Maybe it would be a mercy if 
                                the balanitis came back and he had to be circumcised young. 
                              <P>I'd be pleased if you could sound any notes of warning re these 
                                assumptions. 
                              <P>(RS: I replied confirming all his suspicions)

        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P>Grewel researched this and found no real anatomical connection.- 
                                Personally I think your urologist is about the most wacky I`ve ever 
                                heard. To change the subject a little ... </P>
                              <P>I recently was hearing about how in Bolivia, the youths describe 
                                themselves as "cartridged" and eagerly await their first intercourse 
                                when their frenulum rips, and they can claim to be "uncartridged" - 
                                interesting from our perspective is that in Bolivia (probably among 
                                the Indian population) the frenulum structure and its ripping are so 
                                predictable that this has developed a "meaning" and is considered on 
                                a par with breaking the hymen - </P>
                              <P>What should you do? - stop listening to wacky urologists and read 
                                my site, -the frenulum and its treatment are described in vivid detail 
                                - start at the <A HREF="file:///C|/welcome.html#start">www.male-initiation.net</A> welcome page- links are clear </P>

                              <P>Forum letter 601 </P>
                              <P>Hello. I went to see my doctor to ask him about my tight foreskin. 
                                Although it completely retracts there's that tight and a little painful 
                                feeling at the frenulum area. My doctor (without seeing my penis) thought 
                                it would be frenulum breve and sent me to the urologist. The urologist 
                                turned to be an old man who thought my frenulum wasn't that tight, 
                                and told me with normal sex practice it would eventually get looser, 
                                or rip. I didn't like the idea, but went home and started daily stretching 
                                of the area. After 2 months there was no visible gain in looseness, 
                                so</P>
                              <P>I went to the urologist again. He seemed a little bit upset for 
                                seeing me again there, and he explained that frenulum is the anatomic 
                                male equivalent to female himen, and added that women don't complain 
                                about doctors not taking their hymen out before sex. Well, that was 
                                the first time I ever heard something like that. In fact, I had read 
                                that there is absolutely no relationship between the frenulum and the 
                                hymen, in the way that there's no male loss of virginity by the ripping 
                                of the frenulum. Can anyone tell me who is right, and whether I should 
                                take a frenuloplasty? </P>
                              <P>Thanks a lot. PS: If you respond, please send a copy of your message <BR>
                                Thanks again. </P>

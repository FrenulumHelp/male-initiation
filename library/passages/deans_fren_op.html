        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P>>Ok. This is the problem. Ever since I was I child I relised that 
                                my foreskin didn't retract fully when erect (no problem when soft), 
                                but I thought it was normal. Masterbation was no problem, but when 
                                I become sexually active I noticed that something was wrong. I can 
                                now retract it when erect so that it is just no longer covering the 
                                head , but it is still painfull. I also noticed that my frenulum was 
                                very tight and was being pulled by the foreskin. My GP said I should 
                                stretch it in the bath, but I was the last patient on a Sunday and 
                                it didn't really seem like he gave a damn. After being with my girlfriend 
                                one day I noticed a tiny rip on my frenulum, so I believe I have frenulum 
                                breve. When soft, and I retract my foreskin fully (ie. not just past 
                                the head, but fully stretching the skin out), it pulls the head of 
                                my penis so that it is almost at a 90 degree angle... Is Frenulum Breve 
                                my problem? Does anyone else know what I mean? Do I need an operation? 
                                Please help...

                              <P>You certainly described what I had! it was a very simple operation 
                                in the Urologists office- deadened the area underneath and trimmed 
                                the frenulum away from the underside of the glans or head. absolutely 
                                changed everything! has been wonderful- can retract fully even when 
                                erect and it doesn't bunch up or form a tight ring behind the head 
                                when erect- of course some continued stretching is necessary- again 
                                -- yes it sure sounds like frenulum breve -<BR>

                              <P><B>What is the operation like?</B>
                              <P>>Hey Dean (or anyone else who has had this),<BR>
  > I was just wondering what the operation to correct frenulum breve 
                                is like. Is it painfull afterwards? Is it weird being under only local 
                                anesthetic? How long until it was fully funtioning again? Were there 
                                any signs that you had an operation? (ie. scars, etc.) Thanks...

                                Really this barely "qualifies" as an operation!! the local anaesthetic- 
                                is put in with a very tiny thin needle after some 'numbing cream' is 
                                put on so you really don't feel it- In my case- it was trimmed away 
                                from the glans so that when it healed- there is no sign it was ever 
                                connected there as I can not see a scar and I suspect there were few 
                                nerves that went into the underside of the glans at that connection 
                                because I don't think I lost any of the feeling in the frenulum- it 
                                merely retreated into the inner foreskin and forms a little bit of 
                                a ridge there now. On healing- everyone heals at different speeds and 
                                I drove 500 miles in sub-zero weather and was in and out of the car 
                                because I had a horse trailer and this was on the same day mine was 
                                done. I took about three weeks before it was completely healed even 
                                tho it was 'usable' in about a week!<BR>
                                You may get another bonus-- as I did with an extra bit of length! Hope 
                                this is helpful-<BR>

        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P> Hello!<BR>
                                I found your site very informative and helpful. I thought I would share 
                                my son's situation with you...and maybe receive your opinion on it. 
                                My son is 1 year old, and at birth was supposedly circumcised. Enough 
                                foreskin was not removed and he has continuously been suffering from 
                                adhesions. He was just seen by a pediatric urologist yesterday who 
                                has suggested not redoing the circumcision, but to release the adhesions 
                                (I believe he used the term "lance" the adhesions?) with my son under 
                                anesthesia. 
                              <P>In situations like this...where the infant suffers from preputial 
                                adhesions, do you feel it is best to completely redo the circumcision, 
                                or to only break the adhesions? I found it very frustrating to have 
                                to put my son through this since he was supposed to be circumcised 
                                at birth, but to look at him, as the doctor said yesterday, the appearence 
                                of my son's penis is that of a uncircumcised boy.<BR>
                                best wishes to you.<BR>
                                USA 
                              <P>Hello,<BR>
                                The ways of the US medic are in this respect something of a mystery. 
                              <P>I believe generally you can be thankful that your son received only 
                                a partial circumcision .. some infants with the full circ. have too 
                                much skin removed ... 
                              <P>Now humm ...adhesions can refer to two things: I believe what you're 
                                talking about is skin bridges, could you refer to the short summary 
                                on<BR>
  <A HREF="../../../../welcome.html#start">www.male-initiation.net</A>
                              <P>skin bridges would need cutting i.e. lancing .... , your urologist 
                                has in my opinion a good approach, in other words dont recircumcise 
                                your son ... 
                              <P>Please tell me if they are not skin bridges.<BR>
                                thanks --- good luck<BR>

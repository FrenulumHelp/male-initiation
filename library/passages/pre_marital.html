        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P>forum letter 10 
                              <P> I am a 26 year old male with an uncorected phimsosis since adolesence. 
                                I have a large overhang which I am not bothered about but I am also 
                                unable to retract my foreskin. I have never experienced any real problems 
                                with urination (apart from the requirement of a few extra shakes) so 
                                have never done anything about it. However I recently awoke with a 
                                fully retracted trapped foreskin (the first ever)(must have been a 
                                good dream) and after about 10 mins of panic managed to pull it back 
                                over by squeezing the blood out of the glans.<BR>
                                I never knew that I was different and am now developing quite a complex. 
                                I am a virgin for religious reason however I am due to be married next 
                                month and I am now quite concerned that I will not be able to have 
                                sex. I have previously tried to put a condom on with my penis hard, 
                                and of course the foreskin non retracted and it just slips off. I have 
                                tried to stretch the opening of my foreskin by inserting progresively 
                                large objects but it doesnt seem to be working and in any case I am 
                                concerned about the pressure that I seem to be exerting on the vain 
                                that goes right to the top of my foreskin. I have no visible opening 
                                but can get it to about 1.5cm when stretched. I think I am looking 
                                at surgery but do not really want to be fully circumcised also I do 
                                not want to visit my family GP are you aware of any clinics in the 
                                U.K where I can get the surgery I need.

                              <P> I would agree mostly with Robin- I don't think you should try to 
  "correct" this before marriage in less than a month. Frankly, I doubt 
                                if you will have very much difficulty having intercourse- especially 
                                if you utilize a good personal lubricant like Astroglide. You should 
                                let her be a part of the time when you are solving the issue. I cant 
                                understand why a condom would slip off even if you do not retract before 
                                putting it on. if you leave some room at the end for some movement- 
                                it would seem it should stay on. I did not have paraphimosis but had 
                                a very tight foreskin due to frenulum breve - I did not have that corrected 
                                until I was about your age- then just the frenulum was trimmed away 
                                from the glans. I have found that the best way for me to stretch is 
                                to slowly retract while hard- over the years I have been able to get 
                                mine all the way back along the shaft with no problem. If those without 
                                a foreskin can stretch enough to generate a simblance of one - those 
                                of us fortunate enough to have one should be able to stretch over time 
                                if carful- even if surgical intervention short of a full circ- you 
                                still need to keep it pliable. I for one applaud you for wanting to 
                                retain one- I have found much joy in having it.<BR>
                                good luck

        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P>I want to give you my heartfelt thanks for putting together the 
                                website about the problems of the foreskin of the penis. I was circumcised 
                                (as I thought, until now) when I was around 1 1/2 years old, and recently, 
                                while undergoing talk-therapy with a psychologist I discovered how 
                                bad I really felt about that. That made me search for information about 
                                circumcision on the internet. </P>
                              <P>However, talking with my mother, I learned that I was not circumcised, 
                                just 'cut' as she put it, bc they (my parents and my child doctor) 
                                where nervous about the fact that they could not force the foreskin 
                                over the head. I guess what the operation she mentioned must have been 
                                a Dorsal Slit, or Partial circumcision. I am not sure about which one, 
                                as my head is completely uncovered, and have been that way for as long 
                                as I can remember ( I am 30 years). Still I have problems believing 
                                I was not fully circumcised. Jugding >from what my mother have told 
                                me, I guess I had Phimosis. I will go to a urologist to get an accurate 
                                diagnosis.</P>
                              <P>Reading the information provided by you on the internet really enlightened 
                                me. I am understanding more and more how this operation probably affected 
                                me and my feelings of secureness and confidence and being a normal 
                                healthy male since I was a little kid. I feel mutilated, and I feel 
                                as if I am not whole. I also have some problems feeling like a real 
                                man, and following my male instincts. I also have a deep and hidden 
                                resentment for my mother, which I realized I have had since early childhood, 
                                possibly connected to this operation. It's a fucking shit!! I feel 
                                really bad about that.</P>
                              <P>Circumcision should be the last possible way out. It can be very 
                                traumatic for a little kid. For not to speak about the loss of the 
                                protection of the foreskin and the significant decrease in the sensitivity 
                                in the head, and the loss of special nerves cut away with the foreskin.</P>
                              <P>Thanks a lot for making the information available. It really helped 
                                me understand more about myself.</P>
                              <P>---------------------------------------------<BR>
                              </P>
                              <P>I see no reason for an operation so early, soft phimosis should 
                                stretch, and if only a simple dissolving agent was used on the adhesions 
                                then the child could stretch his own foreskin -- still with the cultural 
                                info. on the subject no individual parent or doctor can be blamed for 
                                anything, ... the info is the problem, ... I feel one of the biggest 
                                problem are the two opposed anti and pro circumcision groups on this 
                                modern information network, with both spouting diametrically opposed 
                                opinions its hardly suprising that other people get confused.</P>
                              <P>Practically the entire human race has problems following sexual 
                                instincts, -- I am obviously more concerned with male side of this, 
                                there is a tremendous pressure on young men to be passive active sensitive 
                                hard, etc. etc. and no due cultural attention to the anatomical fact 
                                of life which makes them male .. the erection. --- our culture believe 
                                that such considerations are all of a psychological nature -- which 
                                puts ridiculous extra presure on men who do in fact have anatomical 
                                problems ...</P>
                              <P>My problem is this, I have talked with men who were circumcised 
                                during infancy and they don't feel it as a mutilation, I have heard 
                                from others on line who say it is a mutilation, ---- could this difference 
                                depend on how the operation was done? ---- either the psychological 
                                preparation and attitude was wrong, e.g. maybe you were treated as 
                                a problem - even that somehow the foreskin problem was your fault. 
                                On the other hand a quick botched operation with e.g. too much skin 
                                cut off ... this is a mutilation</P>
                              <P>But what I noticed was this:<BR>
  >they (my parents and my child doctor) were nervous<BR>
  >about the fact that they could not force the foreskin over the head. </P>
                              <P>Trying to force the foreskin back will always be a traumatic experience, 
                                and this coupled with a nervous uncertain worry from the adults round 
                                you, will certainly leave scars on the personality ... and it seems 
                                to me more pertinent than anything you say over the actual operation.</P>
                              <P>So - You're obviously going through a questioning phase, I'd be 
                                intereted to hear more if you uncover any other long lost memory ...<BR>
                              </P>
                              <P>Cheers and thank a lot for the letter.<BR>
                                Robin</P>

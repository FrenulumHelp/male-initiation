        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                            <TD><P><B>PINHOLE PHIMOSIS and URINARY PROBLEMS</B>
                              <P>I was circumcised at age 14. After reading your essays I now know 
                                that the operation corrected a pin hole phimosis. The pin-hole was 
                                tiny and urination was accompanied by ballooning. 
                              <P>I had recurring incidences of Urinary Tract Infections for as far 
                                back as I can remember. During these incidences the UTI were accompanied 
                                by kidney pain and caused excruciating stinging when urinating. When 
                                cured of the UTI by large quantities of Penicillin I still needed to 
                                urinate often. I remember wetting my pants in Grade 4 - the teacher 
                                had refused to let me go to the bathroom during class - I tried to 
                                hold on but I couldn't. I was a frequent bed-wetter until about age 
                                9. </P>
                              <P>Up until age 14 my family doctor was aware of the Phimosis. I guess 
                                that he must have favored a wait and see approach. My urologist did 
                                extensive tests and even opened the hole surgically to about 3mm, but 
                                as far as I am aware did not suggest circumcision. Finally at last 
                                a new family doctor over ruled the specialist and recommended circumcision. 
                                This was carried out under total anesthetic by the new family doctor 
                                himself. All UTI problems stopped after the circumcision. </P>
                              <P>The Phimosis and its consequences have had a profound affect on 
                                who I am. The health issues are minor compared with the psychological 
                                impact of this condition. These issues range from the shame of wetting 
                                my pants in class, to being a spectacle at the urinal, to the embarrassment 
                                of the circumcision itself. This lead to shyness and reinforced my 
                                introversion and made me a loner. My shyness lead to questions being 
                                asked about my sexuality, which undermined my confidence still further. 
                                The up-side is that I focused on work issues which provided plenty 
                                of positive reinforcement. </P>
                              <P>Who knows who I would have been if I had been circumcised soon after 
                                birth ? I suspect a very different person to the one typing this e-mail. 
                                The most important question, "Would that other me be a happier person?". 
                                Who knows ? </P>
                              <P>My wife and I are about to have a son - our first. We already have 
                                3 wonderful daughters! This happy news led me to the web to research 
                                circumcision. During this research I came across your site and the 
                                answers to so many questions. It is so freeing to have facts. </P>
                              <P>You will understand that I am prejudiced strongly in favor of circumcision 
                                for my son. But I do fear my prejudices. This is a big issue and I 
                                don't want to make this call lightly. </P>
                              <P>Robin, I would be grateful if you could answer two questions: </P>
                              <P>1. Is phimosis a hereditary condition, and so is it more likely 
                                that my son will have this condition ? </P>
                              <P>2. I was a late bloomer. My first signs of the onset of puberty 
                                occurred just a few days before my 15th birthday, about 9 months after 
                                the circumcision. Is the late onset of puberty associated with phimosis, 
                                or is this an unrelated issue? </P>
                              <P>Many thanks, </P>
                              <P>____________________________</P>
                              <P>RS. I can understand that men like you are easy converts for the 
                                pro circ cause .... I believe you still retain an amount of clear rational 
                                thinking on the subject so I will attempt to win you for an unbiased 
                                attitude to circumcision and the priority of primary health-care. </P>
                              <P>Phimosis can be checked for, and the possibility of secondary phimosis 
                                (during puberty) can be educated about </P>
                              <P>&gt;1. Is phimosis a hereditary condition, and so is it more likely 
                                that my son will have this condition ?</P>
                              <P> If phimosis is hereditary then it is through the female, there 
                                are occasional reports from men where the whole male side of the family 
                                seems to have it, but it would be far more widely reported if there 
                                was any non-chance connection, - I`d have heard more about it </P>
                              <P>&gt;2. I was a late bloomer. My first signs of the onset of puberty 
                                occurred just a few days before my 15th birthday, about 9 months after 
                                the circumcision. Is the late onset of puberty associated with phimosis, 
                                or is this an unrelated issue? </P>
                              <P>very interesting: - many doctors (French and Russian ) have maintained 
                                this ... it certainly doesn`t speed the onset of puberty ...</P>
                              <P> I would suggest with your experience and worry/concern about your 
                                son that IF THERE IS ANYTHING WRONG that you get him circumcised (consider 
                                a partial circumcision) ... but if there is nothing wrong with him, 
                                then it is inappropiate to operate, -- during childhood you can check 
                                during his baths, so its easy to keep an eye on him, the only worry 
                                then is that in his pre-puberty years when his privacy is probably 
                                important that he gets some sort of education on the possibility of 
                                secondary phimosis and is not then too embarrassed to complain should 
                                this 1% chance occurr. </P>
                              <P>greetings <BR>

        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P> >hello there!<BR>
  >i'm 25 and i was recently circumcised because i had a forskin that 
                                was<BR>
  >non retractable(phimosis?) .it was only during the procedure that 
                                the<BR>
  >urologist discovered that the forskin was attached to the glands about<BR>
  >half way down.now i'm left with a half circumcision! the urologist 
                                told<BR>
  >me that its impossible to cut the forskin away from the glands as 
                                its<BR>
  >stuck like glue.my question to you is,is this true or are there methods<BR>
  >to take care of this? should i get a second opinion?your response 
                                would<BR>
  >be greatly appriciated as i have been having a hard time dealing with<BR>
  >this!!it seems to me that if you could give somone a face lift you 
                                must<BR>
  >be able to do this? perhaps a plastic surgeon?</P>
                              <P>> by the way i'm living in france at the moment (nice)so if you 
                                have<BR>
  >any urologists to recommend that would be great.<BR>
  > thanx</P>
                              <P>your description sounds crazy, from your description I do not believe 
                                this urologist knows what he^s talking about ... but then I also have 
                                no clear idea of what the problem is, ... Hummmm ... is the foreskin 
                                like this from birth, is it a true congenital deformity? ... (I doubt 
                                it and I^m sure even in this case a plastic surgeon could cure it) 
                                .. what I tend to suspect and the easiest most normal explanation - 
                                is that the infant adhesions have for some reason stuck together like 
                                skin bridges, ... </P>
                              <P>you should read<BR>
                                <A HREF="../../adhesions.html#start">http://www.male-initiation.net/adhesions.html</A></P>
                              <P>is there a hollow space under the remaining foreskin (possibly just 
                                behind the glans), or is it tightly bonded to glans and penis with 
                                no possible movement?</P>
                              <P>you should definitely get a second opinion (sorry no idea of doctors 
                                in France except for Brittany)</P>
                              <P> > thanx for your response!!<BR>
                                yes well its sort of hard to discribe but basically the forskin has 
                                bonded with the glans around the entier edge of the glans.there is 
                                about a 1/4 of an inch of skin left covering the rest of the glans.i'm 
                                not sure if there is movement?</P>
                              <P> the urologist said that when he tried to cut the skin away from 
                                the head that it started to bleed alot so he stopped.he also said that 
                                it could be dangerous if the glans were cut into.is this true?</P>
                              <P> wish i could send you a picture.i hope maybe i have made it more 
                                clear!just try and imagine that the remaining forskin is attached to 
                                the rim of the head all around.so that the skin is actually closer 
                                to the tip on the bottom side ,covering the frenelum breve,than the 
                                top! please send your advice as i would love to have this corrected!<BR>
                                thanx</P>
                              <P> >could be dangerous if the glans were cut into.is this true?</P>
                              <P>yes cutting the glans is very bad</P>
                              <P>>wish i could send you a picture.</P>
                              <P>send me one maybe I can help more but I&laquo;&laquo;ve said all I can</P>
                              <P>>i hope maybe i have made it more<BR>
  >clear!just try and imagine that the remaining forskin is attached 
                                to<BR>
  >the rim of the head all around.so that the skin is actually closer

  >the tip on the bottom side ,covering the frenelum breve,than the top!</P>
                              <P>do you realise this is normal, the glans is "shorter" underneath, 
                                ..</P>
                              <P>I feel sure there must be a treatment and a way to cut the adhesive 
                                layer that sticks the foreskin to the glans, but it is not a normal 
                                urological job, ... I feel the cosmetic surgeon may have a sure enough 
                                hand to attempt this sort of cut ... I imagine it would cost something, 
                                or you could try fighting it through on NHS but it would be easier 
                                if you are rich, ... there is a Dr. Cuckow in London who specialises 
                                in foreskin surgery, but he asks 125 pounds for the consultation and 
                                1,200 for plastic remoulding the foreskin, hell knows how much yours 
                                would cost ...</P>
                              <P>I think you`ve gotta go very slowly, gather information, find a 
                                doctor with a sure enough hand to cut confidently without damage to 
                                the glans, (Urologists are only trained in minor surgery) </P>
                              <P> ... maybe something else will occur to me, so tell me further developments.

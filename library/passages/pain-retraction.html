        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P>I happened upon your website as I was doing homework for my human 
                                development class. I have three boys - 3 1/2 yr. old twins (identical/mirrored) 
                                and a two yr. old.</P>
                              <P> They are all uncircumcised (but my husband is circumcised) - and 
                                I have a few questions that my family doctor hasn't been able to make 
                                clear for me. The youngest has what I guess is called a "natural circumcision" 
                                - he has very little foreskin, and nothing is obstructed (he can urinate 
                                fine). Is there anything that I should be aware of in his development 
                                with this condition?</P>
                              <P> Secondly, the twins are very sensitive about having their foreskin 
                                pulled back, even a little bit. They say it hurts, could this be normal?</P>
                              <P> I'm curious, because I know that more and more boys are not being 
                                circumcised these days - yet I don't think that doctors are preparing 
                                parents like me and my husband for caring for uncircumcised penises.</P>
                              <P> I found your site to be very interesting and informative, and though 
                                it may not be geared towards parents with limited medical knowledge, 
                                I feel that I learned quite a bit about something that I was generally 
                                unaware of. Thank you </P>
                              <P>Hello,</P>
                              <P>The youngest with a natural circumcision has no problem -- to be 
                                born with this condition is even sometimes considered as a gift from 
                                God.</P>
                              <P>In my opinion the 3 and 1/2 year olds should not experience pain, 
                                ... I get letters all the time from men who have gone through life 
                                adapting to such painful or uncomfortable conditions --- I suspect 
                                the pain in this case might be because the bond between the foreskin 
                                and glans is still unresolved, ... the so called adhesions, ... in 
                                turn this can lead to the overhang remaining unstretched, thus not 
                                even allowing an examination of the extent of the adhesions. -----</P>
                              <P>Suggest to your sons that they pull the foreskin forward: instead 
                                of pulling it back<BR>

                                is an article written by a mother of two, it describes her attempts 
                                to release her sons adhesions, .... </P>
                              <P>I feel sure there must be an easy method to release these adhesions...and 
                                it is in my opinion one of the most ridiculous ommissions, and "things 
                                overseen" by our culture that no-one yet has started researching how 
                                to speed up the separation of the adhesions, I write my speculations 
                                about this on another file<BR>
  <A HREF="../../dissolve.html#start">htttp://members.tripod.co.uk/origins/dissolve.html</A><BR>
                                ... I dont tell no lies, but I aint got no simple accurate answers. 
                                ---- I would need a herbalist, a chemist, or a biologist to bring the 
                                research further, maybe you yourself will have some ideas ... So,</P>
                              <P>I hope you've discovered my very beautiful MAP<BR>
                                  <A HREF="../../map.html#start">htttp://members.tripod.co.uk/origins/map.html</A><BR>
                                we're down in the torquoise section, "Natures Way" and "Dissolve" ... 
                                there is one other file which talks directly about the pain from adhesions, 
                                and why I consider it so important to release them, "Early Learning".

                              <P>If I could ask you to read the above and then keep in touch with 
                                any results or thoughts, then I'd look forward to it.</P>

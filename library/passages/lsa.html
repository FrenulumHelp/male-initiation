        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                                </B> In one reported case, after 6 months of frustrating attempts with 
                                cortisone, a homoeopath was consulted. Homeopathic cures are specific 
                                to the individual and related to the condition of his whole body, nevertheless 
                                it appears recognised that &quot;Thuja&quot; will often cure balanitis. 
                                In the reported case it was administered with a LM12 potency as a liquid 
                                2 drops morning and evening for the first 3 months and had a 90% success. 
                                After the first 3 months the higher potency LM18 was recommended to 
                                complete the process.</P>

                                during peak hay fever season, the seldane dosage increased and LSA 
                                went wild. I've stopped Seldane and gotten less trouble.</P>

                                At the moment, Flaccid retraction is not a problem, but I can't retract 
                                during erections.</P>
                              <P>&gt;Are you talking about a generalised tightness throughout the 
                                foreskin,<BR>
  &gt; or is there a particular tightness at the end of the foreskin?</P>
                              <P>It seems to have ended up being a ring of tissue approx 2mm axially 
                                behind the coronal flare, which has less elasticity than the rest of 
                                the member. When flaccid, it is forward of the above mentioned rim.</P>
                              <P>&gt;Do you get an hourglass effect round the shaft of the penis<BR>
  &gt;when the foreskin is retracted?</P>
                              <P>Yes.<BR>
                                There is an hourglass form, approx. 2mm &quot;thick/wide&quot; located 
                                1/4 of length away from coronal ridge. It spans the circumference, 
                                with patches of less density.</P>
                              <P>&gt;So is your ring going parallel to the join between inner and 
                                outer foreskin?<BR>
  &gt;If you look from the side, the hourglass doesn't go straight<BR>
  &gt;round, it slopes in to where your frenulum was . . .</P>
                              <P>Yes, although its not much of a slope.</P>
                              <P>The band of tight skin is roughly 1/8 wide, so it is not the whole 
                                foreskin that's tight, it is difficult to determine what is scar tissue 
                                versus what is LSA, but there has been noticeable improvement where 
                                the ring has patches of near normally elastic in it.</P>
                              <P>I'm wondering how many layers of skin are affected, I believe there 
                                are 7, but how many are damaged ?</P>
                              <P>&gt;layers of skin? there are ridges, I have about ten ridges,</P>

Question for folks out there.<BR>
I had a circumcision a few years ago, as an adult, in response to recurrent 
balanitis. The problems disappeared and I was very happy with all aspects 
of the surgery.
<P>It's been about 5 years and the foreskin appears to be getting longer. 
  While nowhere near as long as it previously was, it can be pulled to 
  cover the entire glans. I recognize some folks on the net would be 
  happy about this, but I prefer myself cut. Has anyone else had a similar 
  experience? I'm considering going in for a second time. How much can 
  be taken off without a problem?</P>
<P>PS - notice to the anti circ crowd - this is a single incident for 
  an adult male - not a political statement about neonatal, routine circumcision. 
  Let me be please.</P>
<P>------<BR>
  Dear S.K.<BR>
  &gt;You can get any amount you like to cut off, A consensus of opinion 
  (which is quite a surprise around here) suggests that a surgeon who 
  can perform with the freehand method, would be able to give you the 
  trim you choose.</P>
<P>&gt;Can I ask, previous to your first operation, did you have any 
  problems with retracting your foreskin, - often the doctors don't ask 
  this question, and often this is the cause of balanitis.</P>
<P>&gt;(maybe e-mail contact would be mutually profitable)<BR>

  From e-mail<BR>
  I had some trouble with phimosis as a teenager, but was too afraid 
  to deal with it and it eventually cleared up on its own. According 
  to my urologist at the time, the cause of the balanitis will likely 
  never be known - &quot;some people get it&quot; was his comment. It 
  was a chronic problem that went on for several years.</P>
<P>One of the reasons for my current question - the problem seems to 
  be coming back. After several years of no infections, my wife and I 
  have both gotten them recently (me at the fold of excess skin at the 
  edge of the corona).</P>
<P>The balanitis began (at least as something I recognized) when I 
  got married at age 27 and manifested itself as trading yeast infections 
  back and forth with my wife. We tried dozens of remedies over a few 
  years, but the infections always returned. Our doctors never identified 
  a root cause, concluding that for some reason, we were susceptible 
  to them. The partial circumcision was effective in stopping the problem 
  for both of us for five years (until now).<BR>

    TREATMENT</B><BR>
  <BR>
  Hi Robin:<BR>
  Good to hear from you again. Let's see, the saga of the balanitis. 
  What we developed over the course of about 5 years was:</P>
<P>To avoid:<BR>
  1. wash at least twice per day and immediately prior to and after sex <BR>
  2. refrain from oral sex <BR>
  3. wear as loose fitting clothes as possible, including boxer shorts</P>
<P>If the balanitis flared up, so to speak, I used one of the prescription 
  creams. Sorry, it's been a while and I don't recall which one. It was 
  one of the Lotrimin family, but had a different cream base (because 
  the Lotrimin caused some irritation and itching itself).</P>
<P>With the help of the doctors, we tried perhaps a dozen different 
  creams out there, most of the Lotrimin or hyrdocortisone varieties. 
  I tried a couple with the most recent bout and the hydrocortisone seemed 
  to work best this time. Evidently, according to the urologist, everybody 
  reacts differently to different creams and it takes some experimentation 
  to get the correct one.</P>
<P>As we discussed, the partial circumcision was highly effective and 
  I've only had a couple of back-to-back cases in the 5+ years since 
  then. Likewise, my wife has had very few cases of vaginitis since then.<BR>

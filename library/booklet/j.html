                        <br>
                        When the fundamental anatomy involved in being a man is inhibited, 
                        this is bound to have consequences. The problems would combine with 
                        and exaggerate any other disturbances. At the very least, these conditions 
                        could never support and would always undermine fulfillment and sexual 
                        confirmation as a man. <BR>
   <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">The ability to share and satisfy himself and others is restricted. 
                        His intimacy with his own body reflects in any and every close relationship. 
                        When the magic of a man is unconsciously in a state of bondage, who 
                        can say exactly where this may lead his sexual energy? <BR>
   <BR>
   <B class="cap14">Note</B><BR>
   <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">Though a little melodramatic, the only reported case history I have 
                        found comes from Bryk, an anthropologist. He writes "the whole schizoid 
                        inferiority complex of a young man, could be traced to his inability 
                        to manually uncover his glans." The young man "suffered from a congenital 
                        phimosis, which he unfortunately recognised too late,"<span class="refs">15</span> . </P>

                          <B class="cap14">CONCLUSION</B><BR>
                        <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">It appears that in today's European culture, there are a percentage 
                        of men who experience an initiation ritual, which is definitely more 
                        ignorant and sometimes more bizarre than any of the ancient rituals 
                        which Stone Age man practised. <BR>
   <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">Among all the problems which people have, this must be one of the 
                        most ignored and the easiest to solve. These genital conditions must 
                        be very simply checked and prevented in childhood. <BR>

                        <B class="cap14">SYMPTOMS</B><BR>
                      <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">The problem with presenting any individual experience, is that they 
                      are relative to an individuals upbringing, character etc. <BR>
   <BR>
   <strong class="cap14">Anatomical</strong> (erect)</B><BR>
   <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">One example which seems significant as evidence of an unconscious 
                      anatomical disturbance : When half waking up with a full erection, 
                      my reaction was to hold this firmly to suppress it. As the erection 
                      subsided, I'd return to sleep. I had been consciously aware of this 
                      process approximately once a month since the age of eleven. <BR>
   <BR>
                      The lack of wet dreams. <BR>
  <BR>
  <span class="cap14"><strong>Behavioural</strong></B></span><BR>
  <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">One example is particularly clear. When a woman touched my phallus 
                      I lost my erection. There was one exception to this where she used 
                      to pull the foreskin forward (i.e, away from the problem area). I 
                      would argue that regardless of the love and trust in a relationship, 
                      with such a disposition, there is bound to be a degree of anxiety 
                      about one's phallus being held, (or this would develop with experience).<BR>
   <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">The problems encountered by love making is an area which is difficult 
                      to summarise. It seems generally true, for all men with these conditions, 
                      that penetration is impossible without an amount of lubrication. Personally 
                      speaking, it's not that the necessary foreplay was unpleasant, but 
                      I would argue that making love does not come as naturally as it otherwise 
                      would. <BR>
   <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">One thing is clear, and it must be common to all men with these conditions, 
                      using a condom while holding the foreskin forward, requires considerable 
                      practice. </P>

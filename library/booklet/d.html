                        The following detailed anatomical descriptions, may tire some readers, 
                        if so please turn to the central discussion.<BR>

                          <span class="cap14">ADHESIONS</span></strong><BR>
                          <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">The foreskin may stick to the glans, it may stick partially, it may 
                        also restick after being released. <BR>
                        <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">This condition is normal and healthy in babies. Generally it resolves 
                        of its own accord by the age of three, however sometimes the condition 
                        continues up until puberty. <BR>
                        <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">There are different degrees of adhesion. Some boys release the foreskin 
                        themselves at the beginning of puberty, others experience intense 
                        pain when they attempt to do this. (Bettelheim reports a case<span class="refs">4</span> where 
                        during masturbation adhesions "had been partly painful"<span class="refs">5</span>. )<BR>
                        <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1"><B>Note:</B> I believe that when adhesions release at a later age (e.g. at 
                        ten years old) the foreskin develops less elasticity, and this results 
                        in a tight foreskin.<BR>

                        (Greek phimos : a muzzle, nose band of a bridle).<BR>
                          <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">A thin white ring of connective tissue around the end of the foreskin, 
                        about a third of an inch from the end, narrows the opening of the 
                        foreskin and restricts its elasticity. This hinders the retraction 
                        of the foreskin over the coronal ridge and behind the glans. Any difficulty 
                        when flaccid is magnified when erect.</P>
                      <P><strong class="cap14">A Matter of Degree</strong> </B><BR>
                          <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">The ring varies in narrowness. Very extreme degrees often cause urinary 
                        complications or infections, and are discovered in childhood. </P>

                        <BR>
                      For the adolescent, the effect when erect, is similar to trying to 
                      take a T-shirt off by pulling it down. During intercourse, when the 
                      narrowness is extreme, (depending also on the degree of lubrication 
                      and openness of the vagina), the foreskin can ruffle up, to form a 
                      barrier. <BR>
                        <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">If it is possible to retract the foreskin, with a partial phimosis, 
                      the passage over the coronal ridge of the glans may be painful, the 
                      abrasion may cause inflammations and as the process continues these 
                      may lead to infections. There is also the danger of a secondary condition 
                      called paraphimosis : when the foreskin is held trapped behind the 
                      glans, this is a medical emergency. There are also some mild degrees, 
                      which are unnoticeable when flaccid.

                        <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">Medical attention is concentrated on phimosis, because with a phimosis 
                      cleaning is severely hindered, and the area between the foreskin and 
                      glans offers an ideal environment for disease and bacterial infection. 
                      In a study of "3,000 young men, mostly of an age between 18 and 22 
                      . ." (all over 16) " . . A phimosis was found in 8.8%"<span class="refs"> 6</span>. A second 
                      study was on schoolboys between the ages of 14 and 19. Examining if 
                      "the foreskin could be retracted only with difficulty or with pain", 
                      it was found among "229 youths that 20 had these problems. This corresponds 
                      to a frequency of 8.7%"<span class="refs"> 7</span>. <BR>

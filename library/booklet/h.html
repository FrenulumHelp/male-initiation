                        The idea that retraction is unnecessary could be 1) due to repression 
                        of actual experiences of pain and difficulty, 2) it may be learnt 
                        as the result of the approach of unpleasant and growing sensations 
                        of discomfort, or 3) it may be simply that retraction feels unnatural 
                        or is impossible. Experiences of this kind may take place semi-consciously 
                        even before puberty begins. <BR>
                      <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">In other words, this blindness is not due to stupidity on the part 
                        of the boy. Not only is there a severe lack of information to guide 
                        the family doctor and parents, but also an otherwise healthy boy accepts 
                        his body without worrying, and grows accustomed to his own condition, 
                        through erections and self play, possibly even previous to puberty.<BR>
                    <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">There is an area of his own sexual world which a boy with these conditions 
                        can't explore, even something he thinks he's not meant to explore. 
                        His knowledge is that the foreskin is designed to remain forward. He 
                        believes his condition to be normal and healthy, and he is unaware 
                        that he has any limitation which requires treatment.<BR>
                        <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">Ultra-sound pictures have shown that baby boys have erections in the 
                        womb. Reports from parents indicate that a boy may start innocently 
                        playing with his erect penis (with foreskin retraction), at the age 
                        of one and a half years old. It is therefore possible that the learning 
                        process may start even before puberty begins. <BR>
                        <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">At the beginning of puberty most boys begin to masturbate consciously. 
                        It is generally accepted that the most normal method of doing this, 
                        is by moving the foreskin. With these conditions a freely moveable 
                        foreskin at the same time as a full erection is impossible. A boy with 
                        these conditions develops a sexual relationship with himself, which 
                        is to some extent, restrained or restricted, (and he believes that 
                        this is normal).<BR>

The complaints are often discovered when making love or attempting 
                      to, because at this time they are unavoidable. At this time, the erection, 
                      penetration and ejaculation are not exclusively controlled by one's 
                  own hands. <B><BR>
                  </B><IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">A practising Urologist says, "it is not uncommon, . . that a phimosis 
                      is not at all consciously realised by the carrier until the first act 
                      of love" <span class="refs">14</span>. With some degrees of phimosis, (during intercourse, when 
                      the vagina is unlubricated) the foreskin can ruffle up in a turtle 
                      neck making penetration difficult or impossible. It may not be obvious 
                      to the individual that something anatomical is not in working order, 
                      he may think that love making merely requires practice. <BR>
                      <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">Some men with the frenulum breve have the experience of the frenulum 
                      suddenly ripping while making love, others experience pain and tension, 
                      especially during ejaculation. It is clear that when the frenulum rips, 
                      this can save years of adult problems. <BR>
                      <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">There are inevitably a number of types of experience which have not 
                      come to my attention. <BR>

                      <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">Some men, like myself, do not consciously experience any pain or difficulty, 
they believe the foreskin is designed to remain forward, and have adapted 
to this. When a problem is conscious one can come to terms with it, 
and even turn it to some greater strength. Here, the basic problem 
and many of the symptoms are unconscious, or misinterpreted by the 
carrier himself, as being of a psychological nature. <BR>
<IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">Two men who I spoke with had been in the situation of having an extreme 
phimosis without realising this. One of these never masturbated or 
had any interest in sex before his operation. The other, after describing 
how he washed under the foreskin with an extreme phimosis, (by flushing 
the area out with a squeezing action), told me he thought that "everyone's 
normal, we're all just a bit different". I can not prove anything about these men except 
that they had very few sexual experiences. <br>					</TD>

                          <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">For over thirty sexually active years, I was unaware that the movement 
                        of my foreskin was restricted by a combination of a frenulum breve 
                        and a mild phimosis. The phimosis was impossible to check for when flaccid. The frenulum 
                        could have been checked in five seconds and operated in twenty minutes, 
                        had the correct information been available to the medical profession 
                        or my parents. Any man or child today with similar problems to mine 
                        may end up as oblivious to their condition as I was. <BR>
                        <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">The first point to understand is that the frenulum is underneath and 
                        behind the foreskin. When the penis is erect, if the frenulum is too 
                        short it pulls the foreskin forward, therefore to a man with this 
                        condition it is hidden. To visually identify this physiological spring 
                        mechanism, involves the carrier in what are to him unnatural contortions. <BR>
                        <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">The second point is that in public literature there is only occasionally 
                        any mention of the frenulum breve. I have never come across an accurate 
                        way of checking for it, even in medical texts, (one is given under 
                        Prevention). <BR>
                        <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">Unfortunately the explanations in publicly available books, relating 
                        to all three conditions, are often fully inadequate for parents or 
                        any individual who has them. (see Appendix b). Only occasionally is 
                        the medical definition given, that the foreskin cannot be retracted, 
                        or this can only be done with pain or difficulty. Very rarely mentioned, 
                        are pain or difficulty by intercourse or masturbation, and there is 
                        never an indication about what these difficulties may be.<BR>

                        <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">One reason for the lack of information is shown by a surgeon who comments 
                        "The request for circumcision to allieviate painful erections and 
                        intercourse and frenular tears is not widely appreciated in the urological literature. Being unpublished, these complaints can easily be ignored

                      Urologists and surgeons are only aware of the practicalities: a man experiences pain difficulty or tension, and this requires a very small 
                      routine operation. </P>
                    <P><strong class="cap14">Psychological</B></strong><BR>
                        <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">Years previously I had consulted psychologists with a collection of 
                      anatomical, sexual, psychological and social symptoms. I was advised that to understand such 
                      problems would involve a long process of sorting out childhood difficulties.<BR>
                        <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">I never thought about consulting a surgeon or urologist about these 
                      behavioural disturbances, because our cultural knowledge interprets 
                      such matters in terms of upbringing, environment and psychology. <BR>
                        <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">Psychologists seem to have no awareness of the possibility that these 
                      anatomical conditions can lead to sexual, and thus psychological and 
                      social problems. A connection between psychology and this aspect of 
                      circumcision has apparently never been established.<BR>

                          <span class="cap14">OTHER MEN'S EXPERIENCES (My Sample Group)</B></span></strong><BR>
  <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">At first I thought my situation must be a complete rarity. It was 
                      astonishing to question around fifty men over their experiences, six 
                      of these had personal experience of one or other of the congenital 
                      conditions at or after puberty. Altogether my direct sample group 
                      consists of nine men, I heard indirectly (mostly through women) of 
                      another fifteen cases. All the experiences are described, not one 
                      experience disagrees with my descriptions. <BR>
                        <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">The experiences at puberty and the difficulties encountered by love 
                      making are fairly well documented. They are consciously anatomically 
                      painful for the sufferer and therefore easy to explain. <BR>
                        <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">The more advanced behavioural experiences are not only difficult to 
                      describe, but also, here I have spoken with so few other cases. 
                      I cannot prove anything concerning these men, and therefore, I would argue that the conscious experiences 
                      at puberty and during love making, are occurring frequently enough, 
                      to make it worthwhile checking every child, previous to such problems 
                      occurring.</TD>

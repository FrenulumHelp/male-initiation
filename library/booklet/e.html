In Advanced Years</B><BR>
<IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">In a certain percentage of men, the conditions reoccur in old age 
 as the skin becomes less flexible. This is also considered as a congenital 
 complaint. In comparison to the free movement of yesteryear the difference 
 is easy to notice and if operated on promptly the situation causes 
 minimal psychological complications. <BR>
 <BR>
 <strong class="cap14">Secondary Phimosis</B></strong><BR>
 <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">A congenital primary phimosis can often lead to infections, and be 
 cured for reasons of this secondary symptom. <BR>
 <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">On the other hand, circumcision is a treatment often needed for a 
 variety of ailments (skin diseases and infections, penile cancer, 
 diabetes, injuries), and as a result of some of these, the secondary 
 phimosis which may develop. This development is noticable to the individual 
 and therefore (if treated without hesitation), bears little comparison 
 to a congenital primary phimosis.<BR>
 <BR>
 <B class="cap14">FRENULUM BREVE</B><BR>
(Latin Frenulum: a small bridle. Breve: short).<BR>
<IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">The frenulum is like the joining ridge under the tongue, this membrane 
 joins the underside of the glans to the foreskin.<BR>
 <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1"> There are various 
                      degrees of brevity. Occasionally the frenulum is so short that there 
                      is actually no frenulum, the foreskin being attatched directly to 
                      the glans.<BR>
                      <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">With the frenulum breve, when erect the foreskin often pulls back 
                      partially, and then simply slides forward again. Minor degrees allow 
                      retraction behind the glans, apparently causing few problems. However 
                      sufferers feel a tension which therefore limits optimal enjoyment. 
                      The frenulum is the most sensitive area on the phallus. If the area 
                      is sensitive to pain at present, this turns to pleasure after being 
                  operated.</P>

                      Though a circumcision cures the frenulum breve, leaving it little 
                      or nothing to pull on, the incision it is seen to require, is a specific 
                      one. The frenulum plastic (please confirm the English name) is a surgically 
                      insignificant operation, probably the smallest of all, it is generally 
                      performed as an out-patient. An Urologist said he operates "approximately 
                      once a month, . . basically the average age group is around 17 to 
                      27 years old" <span class="refs">9</span>. <BR>

                      WHEN THE FRENULUM RIPS</B><BR>
                      <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">"Among a percentage of men" the frenulum is too short "so that on 
                      erection it tightens to its limit, and then can even rip. . . . a 
                      moment of great alarm follows for both participants at the resultant 
                      bleeding" <span class="refs">10</span>. Such incidents are "not unusual"<span class="refs">11 </span> . Sometimes it rips 
                      on the first sexual encounter, often later, sometimes it rips partially, 
                      and sometimes twice. My research showed from three cases of ripping, 
                      that two had not informed their doctors, (it heals spontaneously). 
                      There is reason to believe that this is occurring at a far greater 
                      frequency than the medical profession realises. <BR>
                      <BR>
                      <B class="cap14">General Notes</B><BR>
                      <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">One woman described a man who was always soft inside her until ejaculation 
                      when it hurt him, he was aware that the frenulum caused this pain. 
                      One man who was aware of the frenulum being too tight, simply advised 
                      his girl-friends not to touch him there. It appears some of the men 
                      with this condition do have an awareness of it, problems being caused 
                      mostly by the lack of information about the possibility of an improvement. <BR>
                      <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">When the frenulum breve is combined with a partial phimosis, this 
                      can lead to further complications. Some of these partial degrees of 
                      phimosis are impossible to check for when flaccid, this is the conclusive 
                      reason for the frenulum also being checked and treated before puberty. <BR>

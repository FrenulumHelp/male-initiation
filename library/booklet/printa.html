                              He grows accustomed to himself, never questioning nature, and he is 
                              unaware that he has any restriction. As a result of being unaware 
                              of them, these conditions influence the sexual behaviour in an irrational 
                              manner. Emotional responses become confused, and the social behaviour

                            An important question for many people is whether routine male circumcision 
                            should be practiced or not. Apart from ethnological or religious reasons, 
                            I believe the routine practice on boys who have nothing wrong with 
                            them is pointless. In an information centred culture it would be much 
                            more sensible to routinely check all boys to determine whether a boy 
                            needed treatment, and if so, which sort of correction he required. <BR>

                            of the practice of routine male circumcision. The following theory

   <BR>
   <B class="cap14">The Theory in Short</B><BR>
   <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">The human mind in the late Stone Age, was certainly very different 
                            to ours, however their bodies were similar. The possibility is that 
                            men in those days also had unpleasant experiences with these conditions. 
                            Such men could have had the personal conviction (or deluded fanaticism), 
                            to introduce this measure, in order to prevent similar experiences 
                            happening to any other member of their family.<BR>

                            For the adolescent, the effect when erect, is similar to trying to 
                            take a T-shirt off by pulling it down. During intercourse, when the 
                            narrowness is extreme, (depending also on the degree of lubrication 
                            and openness of the vagina), the foreskin can ruffle up, to form a 
                            barrier. <BR>

                            the passage over the coronal ridge of the glans may be painful, the 
                            abrasion may cause inflammations and as the process continues these 
                            may lead to infections. There is also the danger of a secondary condition 
                            called paraphimosis : when the foreskin is held trapped behind the 
                            glans, this is a medical emergency. There are also some mild degrees, 
                            which are unnoticeable when flaccid.

                            that he's healthy? Yes. Simply look : Is the foreskin moving freely?

                                the third year the adhesions should have released of their own accord. 
                                Forcing adhesions will cause pain, therefore they need attention from 
                                a urologist. Has anyone ever tried to devise a solvent for adhesions?<BR>

                            this is bound to have consequences. The problems would combine with

                                another fifteen cases. All the experiences are described, not one

                                to make it worthwhile checking every child, previous to such problems

                            I have had about twenty intimate affairs. Melting in love by cuddling 
                            was an experience which often left me feeling confirmed as a person, 
                            however among many other funny feelings, confidence in my manhood was 
                            always lacking. I realise that psychology books have described many 
                            reasons for sexual inhibitions and the lack of confirmation in one's 
                            sexuality, however the effects of these conditions are mentioned nowhere.<BR>
                            <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">At this point, my personal recommendation is to read the section on 
                            behavioural symptoms, (on page 14). Unfortunately these subjective 
                            functional difficulties scientifically prove very little, therefore, 
                            the following section offers an analysis. <BR>
                            <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">The situation we will consider is a man who has only to a limited degree 
                            if ever, acknowledged his phallus. There is no suggestion that men 
                            should be arrogantly or obsessively phallic. </P>

                                avoids pain or difficulty (at an unconscious level), this results 
                                in an anxiety or apprehensiveness (at an unconscious level). When 
                                his experience of masculinity is mixed with an unconscious anxiety 
                                how can he develop a realistic sense of confidence or pride as a sexually 
                                confirmed male? <BR>
                            <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">The following attempt at a general analysis, in addition to further 
                                describing my own case, may also help to explain the effects on a 
                                man with an extreme phimosis. <BR>

                                of the sexuality than on the phallus itself? When this anatomical 
                                restriction is unrecognised and remains unconscious, it is bound to 
                                lead to sexual confusion and provide a basis for social and psychological

                                an individual to avoid pain and difficulty, and people develop habits. 
                                From an analytical point of view, this lack of awareness is probably 
                                stimulated by uncomfortable experiences previous to puberty, a learned 
                                experience of difficulty at puberty, this being reinforced after puberty.</P>

                              adhesions always leads to their discovery at puberty. The frenulum

                              pointless and (when unlubricated) it was painful. I did not question 
                              this, I thought this was normal. At the age of twenty eight, after 
                              consulting literature on circumcision, I checked myself, I had forgotten 
                              the unlubricated sensation of pain at puberty, and on this occasion 
                              the foreskin retracted without any pain or difficulty, (and naturally 
                              sprang forward again). The idea that my condition was a normal and

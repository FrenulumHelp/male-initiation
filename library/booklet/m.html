An important question for many people is whether routine male circumcision 
 should be practiced or not. Apart from ethnological or religious reasons, 
 I believe the routine practice on boys who have nothing wrong with 
 them is pointless. In an information centred culture it would be much 
 more sensible to routinely check all boys to determine whether a boy 
 needed treatment, and if so, which sort of correction he required. <BR>

<IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">The text continues with a study of the unsolved mystery of the origin 
 of the practice of routine male circumcision. The following theory 
 has never been considered by anthropologists.<BR>

 <B class="cap14">The Theory in Short</B><BR>
<IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">The human mind in the late Stone Age, was certainly very different 
 to ours, however their bodies were similar. The possibility is that 
 men in those days also had unpleasant experiences with these conditions. 
 Such men could have had the personal conviction (or deluded fanaticism), 
 to introduce this measure, in order to prevent similar experiences 
 happening to any other member of their family.<BR>

Full marks for creativity goes to New Guinea, "Long pendulous foreskins 
 are apparently a thing of beauty for some tribes in New Guinea who 
 deliberately stretch them by suspending weights from the penis"<span class="refs">36</span> . <BR>
<IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">There is the possibility of "removing some of the foreskin and leaving 
 the remainder as a flap, as practiced by the Maasai and Kikuyu of 
 East Africa, or cutting the foreskin away but retaining it as two 
 flaps, as practiced by the Tikopia of Polynesia"<span class="refs">37</span> . <BR>
<IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">"The most rudimentary form of male circumcision is a simple gash of 
 the prepuce", "the simple process of tearing the prepuce with the 
 fingers", or "a wedge-shaped piece is excised"<span class="refs">38</span> . <BR>
<IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">It is worth noting that "In some Turkish families the foreskin is 
 retracted straight away after birth, and this is done periodically, 
 in order to prevent adhesions"<span class="refs">39</span> . In addition at least two cultures 
 perform an incision of the frenulum, "the inhabitants of the Loyalty 
 Islands . . and, . . on Tahiti"s<span class="refs">40</span> . <BR>

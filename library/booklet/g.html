                          <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">Among young children, the main psychological difficulties which the 
                        congenital conditions present, is from phimosis resulting in a longer 
                        infection (often due to urinary problems) before having an operation. 
                        The nature of such disturbances appears to be a conscious one of early 
                        embarrassment with possibly a resultant lack of self esteem. Two men 
                        had intense memories of disturbing episodes in their childhood, which 
                        they thought had been caused by phimosis. The subject requires a deeper 
                        study, it is beyond the scope of this essay. <BR>

  <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">In Europe today, many operations occur once puberty has started. A 
                        number of cases have come to my attention. Most of the problems arise 
                        simply because boys masturbate, and the rubbing action of a phimosis 
                        repeatedly passing over the coronal ridge of the glans, causes soreness, 
                        which may subsequently develop into inflammations or infections. <BR>
   <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">Two men described how due to this process, an infection became so 
                        obvious that they were forced to tell their parents. Two more reports 
                        without any infection, are of masturbating painfully for five and 
                        nine years. One adolescent with adhesions reported consciously avoiding 
                        pain, until he was eighteen. All these latter cases experienced pain, 
                        or the proximity of pain for several years before they felt confident 
                        enough to be able to approach a doctor, or to persuade him to operate. <BR>
   <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">When it is left to the boy alone to discover by the conscious pain 
                        of his first active erections, it means that a considerable percentage 
                        of boys who are not routinely circumcised or checked, are going to 
                        have a fully distorted first impression of sex and manhood. An absurdly 
                        mismanaged and senseless puberty ritual. </P>

                      <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">A great number of people have asked me "Why did it take you so long 
                      to discover?" To summarise an answer, it is normal and healthy for 
                      an individual to avoid pain and difficulty, and people develop habits. 
                      From an analytical point of view, this lack of awareness is probably 
                      stimulated by uncomfortable experiences previous to puberty, a learned 
                      experience of difficulty at puberty, this being reinforced after puberty.</P>
                    <P><span class="cap14"><strong>ORIGINS</B></strong></span><BR>
                        <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">There are hundreds of different degrees and combinations of these 
                      three conditions, some are possibly psychologically harmless, while 
                      others are more dangerous. It seems that the imminence of pain from 
                      adhesions always leads to their discovery at puberty. The frenulum 
                      breve and phimosis are often discovered later. It may be an exaggeration, 
                      but one surgeon tells us "men between 20 and 30 years old" - with 
                      a frenulum breve or phimosis - "always complain that the operation 
                      was neglected in childhood"<span class="refs">13</span> . <BR>
                        <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">In my own case, at the age of eleven when I retracted the foreskin 
                      on the erect penis, it sprang forward again, it was uncomfortable, 
                      pointless and (when unlubricated) it was painful. I did not question 
                      this, I thought this was normal. At the age of twenty eight, after 
                      consulting literature on circumcision, I checked myself, I had forgotten 
                      the unlubricated sensation of pain at puberty, and on this occasion 
                      the foreskin retracted without any pain or difficulty, (and naturally 
                      sprang forward again). The idea that my condition was a normal and 
                      healthy one, was thus confirmed. <BR>
                        <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">Men with an extreme phimosis apparently never notice any sensation 
                      of pain or difficulty, they simply find retraction impossible. In 
                      many cases, the individual is not consciously aware of any inability 
                      to retract the foreskin, it is simply not desirable. <BR>

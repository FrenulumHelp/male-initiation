                        The human male can be affected by three congenital conditions of the 
                        penis: adhesions, phimosis and the frenulum breve, these occur singly 
                        or in any combination. These conditions anatomically inhibit the relationship 
                        between the foreskin and the glans, particularly on the erect penis, 
                        and this functionally restricts the erection. If these conditions 
                        continue until after puberty they influence a boy's sexual development. <BR>
                        <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">The Encyclopedia Judaica says over circumcision that "10% of boys 
                        eventually need it, because of non-retractibility of the foreskin"<span class="refs"> 3</span>.<br>
                        (Two medical studies arguably support this figure - see page 2). <BR>
                        <BR>
                        When the penis is erect, these conditions have the following effects:<BR>
                        <strong>Adhesions</strong>: The foreskin may stick to the glans restricting any movement.<BR>
                        <strong>Phimosis</strong>: A thin ring of connective tissue, narrows the opening of 
                        the foreskin, and hinders its retraction behind the glans.<BR>
                        <strong>Frenulum Breve</strong>: A fold of skin underneath the glans joins it to the 
                        foreskin, if this is too short it causes the foreskin to slide forward.<BR>
                        <BR>
                        These conditions are usually only treated as the result of a conscious 
                        experience of pain, difficulty, tension, (or any other problem for 
                        example diseases in the area). Such treatment is usually required during puberty or after the first attempts at love-making. <br>
                       <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">The conscious experience of pain and difficulty usually has a disturbing 
                        influence on the sexuality, however the unconscious avoidance of such 
                        uncomfortable sensations can lead to far greater problems. <BR>

                    <P>                      In these latter cases it is not that the individual is consciously 
                      aware of any inability to retract the foreskin, he simply does not 
                      realise that retracting the foreskin is possible, normal or desirable. 
                      He grows accustomed to himself, never questioning nature, and he is 
                      unaware that he has any restriction. As a result of being unaware 
                      of them, these conditions influence the sexual behaviour in an irrational 
                      manner. Emotional responses become confused, and the social behaviour 
                      of an individual adapts to this unconscious anatomical restraint.<BR>

                      <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">This essay was inspired by personal experience. However uncomstructive such experiences might be, they belong to life, and omce one truly understands them, they automatoically resolve, and this brings wholeness. This essay was not written as a means of coming to terms with myself, writing scientific essays is an inefficient method of coming to terms with such experiences. I wrote this essay in order to come to terms with the scientific world <BR>
                      <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">My intentions in writing are primarily, to prove the importance of 
                      routinely checking every uncircumcised boy, before puberty, for adhesions, 
                      phimosis, and the frenulum breve. A second reason is to record aspects 
                      of human nature and experience, which have never been scientifically 
                      acknowledged. Other reasons will unfold with the pages. </P>

                          The idea that retraction is unnecessary could be 1) due to repression 
                          of actual experiences of pain and difficulty, 2) it may be learnt 
                          as the result of the approach of unpleasant and growing sensations 
                          of discomfort, or 3) it may be simply that retraction feels unnatural 
                          or is impossible. Experiences of this kind may take place semi-consciously 
                          even before puberty begins. <BR>

                          of the boy. Not only is there a severe lack of information to guide 
                          the family doctor and parents, but also an otherwise healthy boy accepts 
                          his body without worrying, and grows accustomed to his own condition, 
                          through erections and self play, possibly even previous to puberty.<BR>

                          can't explore, even something he thinks he's not meant to explore. 
                          His knowledge is that the foreskin is designed to remain forward. He 
                          believes his condition to be normal and healthy, and he is unaware 
                          that he has any limitation which requires treatment.<BR>

                          womb. Reports from parents indicate that a boy may start innocently 
                          playing with his erect penis (with foreskin retraction), at the age 
                          of one and a half years old. It is therefore possible that the learning 
                          process may start even before puberty begins. <BR>

                          It is generally accepted that the most normal method of doing this, 
                          is by moving the foreskin. With these conditions a freely moveable 
                          foreskin at the same time as a full erection is impossible. A boy with 
                          these conditions develops a sexual relationship with himself, which 
                          is to some extent, restrained or restricted, (and he believes that 
                          this is normal).<BR>

                          to, because at this time they are unavoidable. At this time, the erection, 
                          penetration and ejaculation are not exclusively controlled by one's

                          the vagina is unlubricated) the foreskin can ruffle up in a turtle

                          to this. When a problem is conscious one can come to terms with it, 
                          and even turn it to some greater strength. Here, the basic problem 
                          and many of the symptoms are unconscious, or misinterpreted by the 
                          carrier himself, as being of a psychological nature. <BR>

                          phimosis without realising this. One of these never masturbated or 
                          had any interest in sex before his operation. The other, after describing 
                          how he washed under the foreskin with an extreme phimosis, (by flushing 
                          the area out with a squeezing action), told me he thought that "everyone's 
                          normal, we're all just a bit different". I can not prove anything about these men except 
                          that they had very few sexual experiences. <br>

                            congenital conditions present, is from phimosis resulting in a longer 
                            infection (often due to urinary problems) before having an operation. 
                            The nature of such disturbances appears to be a conscious one of early 
                            embarrassment with possibly a resultant lack of self esteem. Two men 
                            had intense memories of disturbing episodes in their childhood, which 
                            they thought had been caused by phimosis. The subject requires a deeper

                            number of cases have come to my attention. Most of the problems arise 
                            simply because boys masturbate, and the rubbing action of a phimosis 
                            repeatedly passing over the coronal ridge of the glans, causes soreness, 
                            which may subsequently develop into inflammations or infections. <BR>

                            obvious that they were forced to tell their parents. Two more reports 
                            without any infection, are of masturbating painfully for five and 
                            nine years. One adolescent with adhesions reported consciously avoiding 
                            pain, until he was eighteen. All these latter cases experienced pain, 
                            or the proximity of pain for several years before they felt confident

                            have a fully distorted first impression of sex and manhood. An absurdly

                              basic character was inhibited by upbringing etc., the lack of awareness

                                <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">For over thirty sexually active years, I was unaware that the movement 
                              of my foreskin was restricted by a combination of a frenulum breve 
                              and a mild phimosis. The phimosis was impossible to check for when flaccid. The frenulum 
                              could have been checked in five seconds and operated in twenty minutes, 
                              had the correct information been available to the medical profession 
                              or my parents. Any man or child today with similar problems to mine 
                              may end up as oblivious to their condition as I was. <BR>
                            <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">The first point to understand is that the frenulum is underneath and 
                              behind the foreskin. When the penis is erect, if the frenulum is too 
                              short it pulls the foreskin forward, therefore to a man with this 
                              condition it is hidden. To visually identify this physiological spring 
                              mechanism, involves the carrier in what are to him unnatural contortions. <BR>
                            <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">The second point is that in public literature there is only occasionally 
                              any mention of the frenulum breve. I have never come across an accurate 
                              way of checking for it, even in medical texts, (one is given under 
                              Prevention). <BR>
                            <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">Unfortunately the explanations in publicly available books, relating 
                              to all three conditions, are often fully inadequate for parents or 
                              any individual who has them. (see Appendix b). Only occasionally is 
                              the medical definition given, that the foreskin cannot be retracted, 
                              or this can only be done with pain or difficulty. Very rarely mentioned, 
                              are pain or difficulty by intercourse or masturbation, and there is 
                              never an indication about what these difficulties may be.<BR>

                              my reaction was to hold this firmly to suppress it. As the erection 
                              subsided, I'd return to sleep. I had been consciously aware of this

                              <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">One example is particularly clear. When a woman touched my phallus 
                              I lost my erection. There was one exception to this where she used 
                              to pull the foreskin forward (i.e, away from the problem area). I 
                              would argue that regardless of the love and trust in a relationship, 
                              with such a disposition, there is bound to be a degree of anxiety 
                              about one's phallus being held, (or this would develop with experience).<BR>

                              to summarise. It seems generally true, for all men with these conditions, 
                              that penetration is impossible without an amount of lubrication. Personally 
                              speaking, it's not that the necessary foreplay was unpleasant, but 
                              I would argue that making love does not come as naturally as it otherwise 
                              would. <BR>

                              In Advanced Years</B><BR>
  <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">In a certain percentage of men, the conditions reoccur in old age 
                          as the skin becomes less flexible. This is also considered as a congenital 
                          complaint. In comparison to the free movement of yesteryear the difference 
                          is easy to notice and if operated on promptly the situation causes 
                          minimal psychological complications. <BR>
   <BR>
   <strong class="cap14">Secondary Phimosis</B></strong><BR>
   <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">A congenital primary phimosis can often lead to infections, and be 
                          cured for reasons of this secondary symptom. <BR>
   <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">On the other hand, circumcision is a treatment often needed for a 
                          variety of ailments (skin diseases and infections, penile cancer, 
                          diabetes, injuries), and as a result of some of these, the secondary 
                          phimosis which may develop. This development is noticable to the individual 
                          and therefore (if treated without hesitation), bears little comparison 
                          to a congenital primary phimosis.<BR>
   <BR>
   <B class="cap14">FRENULUM BREVE</B><BR>
                          (Latin Frenulum: a small bridle. Breve: short).<BR>
  <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">The frenulum is like the joining ridge under the tongue, this membrane 
                          joins the underside of the glans to the foreskin.<BR>
   <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1"> There are various 
                          degrees of brevity. Occasionally the frenulum is so short that there 
                          is actually no frenulum, the foreskin being attatched directly to 
                          the glans.<BR>
                        <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">With the frenulum breve, when erect the foreskin often pulls back 
                          partially, and then simply slides forward again. Minor degrees allow 
                          retraction behind the glans, apparently causing few problems. However 
                          sufferers feel a tension which therefore limits optimal enjoyment. 
                          The frenulum is the most sensitive area on the phallus. If the area 
                          is sensitive to pain at present, this turns to pleasure after being 
                          operated.

                          it appears that in many countries and cultures one boy in ten would 
                          have a healthier and happier start to life. Books on child-care must 
                          mention the subject and a check is also necessary as normal practice 
                          in the school entry medical examination. Every boy with one of these 
                          conditions must be discovered and treated before puberty. <BR>

                          Every adolescent and adult male should have the opportunity of educating 
                          himself. When erect, the foreskin is normally movable, with the possibility 
                          of pulling it back inside out so that it sheathes the shaft. In doing 
                          this, the frenulum should not be so tight that it pulls the glans 
                          downward or the foreskin forward.<br>

                          were diagnosed as psychosomatic. The third was offered no alleviative 
                          for the burning sensations. Even if such after effects are psychosomatic, they could be prevented by corrective treatment before puberty. <BR>

                            <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">This condition is normal and healthy in babies. Generally it resolves 
                                  of its own accord by the age of three, however sometimes the condition 
                                  continues up until puberty. <BR>
                            <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">There are different degrees of adhesion. Some boys release the foreskin 
                                  themselves at the beginning of puberty, others experience intense 
                                  pain when they attempt to do this. (Bettelheim reports a case<span class="refs">4</span> where

                                  ten years old) the foreskin develops less elasticity, and this results 
                                  in a tight foreskin.<BR>

                                  foreskin and restricts its elasticity. This hinders the retraction

                                The human male can be affected by three congenital conditions of the 
                                penis: adhesions, phimosis and the frenulum breve, these occur singly 
                                or in any combination. These conditions anatomically inhibit the relationship 
                                between the foreskin and the glans, particularly on the erect penis, 
                                and this functionally restricts the erection. If these conditions 
                                continue until after puberty they influence a boy's sexual development. <BR>
                            <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">The Encyclopedia Judaica says over circumcision that "10% of boys 
                                eventually need it, because of non-retractibility of the foreskin"<span class="refs"> 3</span>.<br>
                                (Two medical studies arguably support this figure - see page 2). <BR>
                                <BR>
                                When the penis is erect, these conditions have the following effects:<BR>
                                <strong>Adhesions</strong>: The foreskin may stick to the glans restricting any movement.<BR>
                                <strong>Phimosis</strong>: A thin ring of connective tissue, narrows the opening of 
                                the foreskin, and hinders its retraction behind the glans.<BR>
                            <strong>Frenulum Breve</strong>: A fold of skin underneath the glans joins it to the 
                                foreskin, if this is too short it causes the foreskin to slide forward.<BR>

                                example diseases in the area). Such treatment is usually required during puberty or after the first attempts at love-making. <br>

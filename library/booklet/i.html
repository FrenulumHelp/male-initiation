                      <P>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I have had about twenty intimate affairs. Melting in love by cuddling 
                        was an experience which often left me feeling confirmed as a person, 
                        however among many other funny feelings, confidence in my manhood was 
                        always lacking. I realise that psychology books have described many 
                        reasons for sexual inhibitions and the lack of confirmation in one's 
                        sexuality, however the effects of these conditions are mentioned nowhere.<BR>
  <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">At this point, my personal recommendation is to read the section on 
                        behavioural symptoms, (on page 14). Unfortunately these subjective 
                        functional difficulties scientifically prove very little, therefore, 
                        the following section offers an analysis. <BR>
  <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">The situation we will consider is a man who has only to a limited degree 
                        if ever, acknowledged his phallus. There is no suggestion that men 
                        should be arrogantly or obsessively phallic. </P>
                      <P><B class="cap14">ANALYSIS</B><BR>
                          <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">In cases of my kind an analysis is relatively simple. If an individual 
                        avoids pain or difficulty (at an unconscious level), this results 
                        in an anxiety or apprehensiveness (at an unconscious level). When 
                        his experience of masculinity is mixed with an unconscious anxiety 
                        how can he develop a realistic sense of confidence or pride as a sexually 
                        confirmed male? <BR>
                        <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">The following attempt at a general analysis, in addition to further 
                        describing my own case, may also help to explain the effects on a 
                        man with an extreme phimosis. <BR>
                        <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">When the foreskin is fastened, restrained or harnessed, its movement 
                        relative to the glans is inhibited. What could be a more direct inhibition 
                        of the sexuality than on the phallus itself? When this anatomical 
                        restriction is unrecognised and remains unconscious, it is bound to 
                        lead to sexual confusion and provide a basis for social and psychological 
                        problems. </P>
                      <P>                        <BR>
                      </P>
                      <br>
                    
                  </TD>
                  <TD WIDTH="50">&nbsp;</TD>
                  <TD WIDTH="435" ALIGN="left" VALIGN="top">
                    <P><span class="cap14"><strong>THE BLIND SPOT</strong></span><BR>
                        <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">This anatomical inhibition functions in a similar manner to the generally 
                      understood emotional inhibition. Anyone with any sort of inhibition 
                      does not experiment as freely in that area, he does not discover, 
                      he is not as aware of, and, he probably does not have as much interest 
                      in the area.<BR>
                        <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">If a boy with these conditions did admire himself, any recognition 
                      of, or belief he establishes in his sexual identity would be based 
                      on a misunderstanding and misinterpretation of reality, (i.e. it would 
                      be based on the misconception that the foreskin is designed to remain 
                      forward).<BR>
                        <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">He is not as aware of himself, and to remain unaware he could never 
                      have compared himself, therefore he is probably not as aware of the 
                      male phallus in general. (On seeing pictures of the phallus with a 
                      retracted foreskin, I automatically thought that such men must be 
                      circumcised).</P>
                    <P><B class="cap14">CONSEQUENCES</B><BR>
                      <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">While I maintain that my entire post-puberty emotional development 
                      was influenced by this hidden anxiety in my own body, to give individual 
                      examples is pointless because any effects on the basic character, 
                      emotions, responses etc., are dependant on, and relative to an individual's 
                      other experiences (upbringing etc.). There is nothing absolute which 
                      can be stated, only that these conditions are compatible with shyness, 
                      anxiety, frustration and privacy, and they are incompatible with a 
                      relaxed sexuality, openness and leading a simple life. <BR>
  <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1"> These phenomena have an irrational and disturbing influence on the 
                      sexual behaviour, at the very least they would hinder any re-education 
                      over sexual inhibitions learnt in childhood. In an adolescent whose 
                      basic character was inhibited by upbringing etc., the lack of awareness 
                      of his condition may merely allow him less chance of breaking free. 
                      Other men may go for years, before the collective experiences resulting 
                      from this unconscious anatomical influence have any serious behavioural 
                      effects. </P>

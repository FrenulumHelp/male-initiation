                        If you understand the story so far, and find yourself agreeing with 
                        this first part, please spread the word about this essay. I am interested 
                        in any form of response. I'd particularly appreciate contact with 
                        anyone who can suggest how to express such matters, in a simpler or 
                        more efficient way. Do you know any doctors, psychologists, or medical 
                        authorities to send this to? <BR>

<IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">Maybe what I've written is enough to show the importance of routinely 
                      checking every male child, previous to any difficulties occurring. 
                      It would be much easier, if other men with similar experiences would 
                      contact me, and share their experiences. <BR>
                      <BR>
Please help me to stop this ignorance around us, so that other boys 
                      / men don't have these initiation problems.<BR>

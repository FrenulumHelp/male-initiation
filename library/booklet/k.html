                        It will be necessary to confirm this section with medical specialists, 
                        however until this happens, the following guide lines might be helpful 
                        for parents. A piece of advice which is sometimes given is not to 
                        force anything.<BR>

   <strong class="cap14">The Best Way to Check</B></strong><BR>
                        <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">Parents have asked me : If a boy is (unsexually) playing with his 
                        erect penis (e.g. during changing at two years old) does this mean 
                        that he's healthy? Yes. Simply look : Is the foreskin moving freely? 
                        Is the frenulum at all restictive?</P>
                      <P><span class="cap14"><strong>Adhesions</strong></B></span><BR>
                        <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">Throughout the first three years of a boy's life the area between 
                        the foreskin and glans may be sealed by the natural adhesions. By 
                        the third year the adhesions should have released of their own accord. 
                        Forcing adhesions will cause pain, therefore they need attention from 
                        a urologist. Has anyone ever tried to devise a solvent for adhesions?<BR>
                        <B><BR>
                          <span class="cap14">Phimosis</span></B><BR>
                        <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">After the third year, the foreskin may be moveable, but if it still 
                        can not be pulled back, a degree of phimosis is indicated. Don't use 
                        any force, this can easily lead to secondary problems. A visit to 
                        the urologist is necessary.</P>
                      <P><strong class="cap14">Frenulum Breve</B></strong><BR>
                        <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">When flaccid or erect the frenulum breve pulls the glans downward, 
                        as the foreskin is retracted to its full extent16, (when flaccid this 
                        causes no pain, when erect force may cause the frenulum to rip). This 
                        condition calls for an incredibly simple operation, (in exactly the 
                        same place where it otherwise rips). </P>

Once some form of these ideas is acknowledged and becomes practiced, 
 it appears that in many countries and cultures one boy in ten would 
 have a healthier and happier start to life. Books on child-care must 
 mention the subject and a check is also necessary as normal practice 
 in the school entry medical examination. Every boy with one of these 
 conditions must be discovered and treated before puberty. <BR>
 <BR>
 <B class="cap14">ADULT CHECK</B><BR>
<IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">Adult books which discuss circumcision must include adequate information. 
 Every adolescent and adult male should have the opportunity of educating 
 himself. When erect, the foreskin is normally movable, with the possibility 
 of pulling it back inside out so that it sheathes the shaft. In doing 
 this, the frenulum should not be so tight that it pulls the glans 
 downward or the foreskin forward.<br> 
 <IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">A word of caution is necessary about late operations and after effects. In two cases these after effects 
 were diagnosed as psychosomatic. The third was offered no alleviative 
 for the burning sensations. Even if such after effects are psychosomatic, they could be prevented by corrective treatment before puberty. <BR>
 <BR>
 <B class="cap14">METHOD OF TREATMENT</B><BR>
<IMG SRC="../drawings/z_transparent.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="1">Careful consideration should be given to the treatment. Some methods 
 of modernising the ancient technique of circumcision are indicated 
 on internet. A few words about some of the ancient alternatives are 
 given in appendix a.<BR>

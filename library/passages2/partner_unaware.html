        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                                                            <P> Dear Robin,
                              <P> I just wanted to write to you and thank you for this <BR>
                                wonderful website. The amount of information you've <BR>
                                collected is awesome, and I especially appreciate the <BR>
                                respectful attitude with which you approach the late <BR>
                                initiate.
                              <P> My partner has a non-retracting foreskin and he has been <BR>
                                unaware of this being abnormal until we started getting <BR>
                                intimate. Understandably, he has avoided intimate <BR>
                                relationships with women so it's a miracle we ever got that <BR>
                                far. I was extremely relieved to realise his fear of <BR>
                                intimacy might be related to a purely anatomical problem. <BR>
                                He still has difficulty taking this news in, and is <BR>
                                probably unaware of the psychological knock-on effects the <BR>
                                condition must have had on him over the years - we're both <BR>
                                over forty. 
                              <P> It's just so great to have the support of such websites, I <BR>
                                honestly don't know what I'd have done otherwise. I wasn't <BR>
                                aware of other treatments than circumcision but since my <BR>
                                partner was strongly opposed to that, I decided to find out <BR>
                                about alternatives, and in the course of that came across <BR>
                                this site. I still don't know what will ultimately become <BR>
                                of him and me but at least this has helped us out of what <BR>
                                otherwise might have become an impasse and hopefully will <BR>
                                lead to him being able to find sexual fulfillment finally.
                              <P> Thank you so much.<BR>
                                x
                              <P> P.S. If you want to, you may use my mail or its elements <BR>
                                for your site but plese don't use my real name. x.

                                Dear x,
                              <P> thanks a lot for your letter, 
                              <P> I was over 40 when I discovered my own condition. This may explain <BR>
                                why  I am so very respectful to the Late Initiate - 
                              <P> Its a crazy experience - these modern initiations are far more <BR>
                                bizarre than a few weeks around puberty - alone in the woods - then a <BR>
                                whipping - maybe a little trot across the burning coals - and then a <BR>
                                sharp flint stone applied appropriately.
                              <P> You need to accurately diagnose this "non-retracting foreskin" - in <BR>
                                order to work out the specific treatment if you want to avoid circumcision.
                              <P> Remember most doctors get no training on this subject and mostly <BR>
                                diagnose phimosis without attempting to be more specific or <BR>
                                recommending any specific treatment.
                              <P> Write and tell us how things develop 
                              <P> All good wishes<BR>
                                Robin

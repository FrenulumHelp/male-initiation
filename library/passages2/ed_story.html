        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                                        Dear Robin,
                                      <P> Yours is a brilliant website.  The information in it is, I believe, enabling me to release myself from a psychological prison that I'd had no idea existed, at least not in any way that could be meaningfully expressed.
                                      <P> Where do I begin?  I think I have to start with my experience of the ignorance of the medical profession as a whole that these not at all unusual mechanical defects can take a good deal to separate both from the male psyche and from possible other unresolved or unknown psychological issues.
                                      <P> In the last few months, since finding this site, I have put together a collection of correspondence with my doctors, and some articles, to form "the book" which, since a major mental breakdown ("acute psychotic episode") in 1984, I have always believed was in me but I hadn't been able to understand, let alone write.
                                      <P> The mental breakdown in 1984 was such an extremely painful and, frankly, baffling experience that it seems that it has been niggling away at the back of my mind all of this time on the basis that there was always going to be a logical explanation.  And that is where I now am.  
                                      <P> I wouldn't say I'm a deeply religious person, but it is clear to me that the same God that was with Abraham has been with me all this time and I feel that this fact, although it doesn't change the logical explanation,  should not be glossed over or airbrushed out when I tell my story.  
                                      <P> I have a suspicion that many of the anti-circers have a deep mistrust of religion especially those where circumcision is practiced routinely as a sign of their covenant with God, rather than being practiced or modified according to particular mechanical defects of the individual.  
                                      <P> You are absolutely right with your promotion of the middle way, or third way, in contrast to the totally opposed arguments of the one-size-fits-all pro-circers and the do-nothing anti-circers.
                                      <P> I shall try to put my story into a nutshell:
                                      <P> Either through a relatively minor, but embarrassing, birthmark or an innately reserved character I have a tendency largely to keep my feelings to myself.  From the age of ten or twelve I had always been slightly puzzled how intercourse wasn't going to hurt (i.e. with what I now realise is frenulum breve and a degree of phimosis), but of course I never could express this puzzlement.  
                                      <P> By 1984 I had fallen so madly in love that I had really to face this perceived difficulty, and by which time also I had collected a bit more "baggage".  
                                      <P> I couldn't express properly my penis worries but simply sought from my doctor, my GP, that he take a kind of general look.  He referred me to a urologist.  The urologist expressed some concern and advised that I perhaps ought to be considered for circumcision and that I should return in three months.  Meanwhile I returned to my GP with very generalised anxiety. I couldn't think who to turn who would listen objectively and respond professionally to such personal matters as were clearly causing me much trouble.
                                      <P> My GP didn't offer me anything for this generalised anxiety.  A few weeks later I had the major breakdown (in the height of which a faith healer, from out of the crowd that had gathered round to watch my torment, engaged with me).  
                                      <P> When I returned home from hospital I talked to a friend about the prospect of me being circumcised.  He told me about a friend of his who had recently had it done.  This was reassuring because it didn't sound so foolish (i.e. having a kids operation in one's mid twenties).  However, he went on to tell me how the operation had all gone horribly wrong, the wound had become infected etc etc.  I therefore decided to give the idea a very wide berth.  I would just take my chance.  Nothing could be as painful as the breakdown I had suffered.
                                      <P> And that was it, really.  The relationship from 1984 ended, but I soon met my wife by whom I now have three children.  Yes, the frenulum has ripped and has elongated by about 1cm.  The foreskin has perhaps loosened a little but the whole mechanism still feels tight: is that "normal"?
                                      <P> &hellip; Well that would have been it, that is, until my son, at the age of six, had some problems with balanitis.  He had a "dorsal slit" operation to loosen the foreskin.  Naturally I was very relieved that he had been attended to.  
                                      <P> By the time he was twelve the niggle at the back of my mind from the breakdown in 1984 had started to take centre stage but I still didn't understand what it was all about.  I suddenly displayed psychiatric symptoms again, thankfully no pain this time, and have since been diagnosed as having Bipolar Affective Disorder.  
                                      <P> In feeling very uncomfortable about the treatment for this disorder, I have been guided to the root of my confusion.  I had not made any association with foreskin problems until one day earlier this year I was at my computer when the word "foreskin" simply popped into my head, so I did a Google search and found your website and in particular that the frenulum has a name and that it can be short, painful and problematic. 
                                      <P> I feel a massive relief (and some anger) and I am embarking now on educating my doctors that there is a neglected issue here, as old as Abraham, that needs to get into the medical profession's and public's collective consciousness.  I believe my doctors are now beginning to understand and accept the turmoil I have experienced and I am, at last, going back to a urologist for advice, not least because I want to be as sure as possible that my son doesn't suffer as I have.  
                                      <P> Thank you, Robin, for your work with this.  It's really important.

                                    Hi Ed,
                                    <P> Well youre right in the centre of it all at present - arent you :)
                                    <P> I remember how I felt ten years ago, Just discovered my frenulum breve<BR>
                                        and relative phimosis - I presume you have a very similar condition,<BR>
                                        docs couldnt see the phimotic ring unless I was erect and they didnt<BR>
                                        even look for the frenulum until asked.
                                    <P> At 43 my world turned upside down as puberty and love experiences<BR>
                                        suddenly became explained - Id always thought I had a psychological<BR>
                                        problem, but here was something far older than Abraham, ... what was<BR>
                                        then impossible was that the urologists and psychologists either<BR>
                                        humoured me or tried to persuade me that this phimosis/sexuality thing<BR>
                                        was all an illusion and I should indeed question my parents and<BR>
                                        upbringing for another 43 years ---
                                    <P> It is for this reason (mainly) that I started the site. Through www I<BR>
                                        found other men with my experience as you are doing - through www I<BR>
                                        eventually got my confirmation, the ackowledgement of my sense for<BR>
                                        truth and how my body/mind functions.
                                    <P> I really dont know where to start answering your letter ...a couple of<BR>
                                        small side points ... One is that Im sure that "phimosis" isnt<BR>
                                        inherited directly, otherwise it would have been deselected. If your<BR>
                                        son has similar problems its not because of your genes, its simply<BR>
                                        because phimosis is not unusual.
                                    <P> Then theres also a practical question: "the frenulum has ripped and<BR>
                                        has elongated by about 1cm.  The foreskin has perhaps loosened a<BR>
                                        little but the whole mechanism still feels tight: is that "normal"?" -<BR>
                                        I suspect there may well be some need to operate. - As youve already<BR>
                                        had enough fun with your doctors -you could just explain simply what<BR>
                                        happens on erection when you attempt to retract fully. If its not<BR>
                                        simple, then Im sort of worried about the amount of writing which<BR>
                                        could develop between us, so let me suggest we could simplify this if<BR>
                                        youve a digital camera, a few pictures of retraction during erection<BR>
                                        would usually allow me to make a more accurate diagnosis than the<BR>
                                        doctors (simply because they dont ask about or see the erection).
                                    <P> I guess the frenulum ripped when you were making love with your<BR>
                                        present wife ... were you previously a virgin? (It is in fact rare<BR>
                                        that a ripped frenulum mends elongated, usually they mend even shorter<BR>
                                        than before, what did you do when it ripped? you must have put an<BR>
                                        antiseptic pad on it or something?)
                                    <P> I dont understand what "Bipolar Affective Disorder" is.
                                    <P> But I can well understand how an undiscovered phimosis leads to all<BR>
                                        sorts of sexual problems - and simply because its unrecognised, one<BR>
                                        believes these are deep psychological problems, this is then very<BR>
                                        simply and directly an illusion because it doesnt acknowledge reality,<BR>
                                        - and it led me to years of torment wondering why I couldnt love some<BR>
                                        girls like I felt - why couldnt I love actually? - very disturbing -<BR>
                                        and all because of "Primeaval Taboo Syndrome" (help stamp out PTS ...)<BR>
                                        - (this is a joke if you were wondering).
                                    <P> I think you understand the situation very well, you ask if this was<BR>
                                        natural reservation or phimosis - "... these not at all unusual<BR>
                                        mechanical defects can take a good deal to separate both from the male<BR>
                                        psyche and from possible other unresolved or unknown psychological<BR>
                                        issues."
                                    <P> yes they go hand in hand - the one supports the other - I tend to<BR>
                                        think the phimosis and potential pain in erections and avoidance of<BR>
                                        this pain was there since birth, so I could happily argue that the<BR>
                                        phimosis is the basis for the psychological development but lets<BR>
                                        consider they go hand in hand - the one supports the other -
                                    <P> "From the age of ten or twelve I had always been slightly puzzled how<BR>
                                        intercourse wasn't going to hurt (i.e. with what I now realise is<BR>
                                        frenulum breve and a degree of phimosis), but of course I never could<BR>
                                        express this puzzlement."
                                    <P> So I guess again (not that I should, but I also like a bit of fun!) I<BR>
                                        guess you had a partial phimotic ring, which scraped over (the coronal<BR>
                                        ridge of) the glans ... --- and it seems this has now stretched a<BR>
                                        little.
                                    <P> You say you are trying to educate your doctors and the culture - this<BR>
                                        is why I say join ARC - I always used to hope that once one doctor<BR>
                                        believed me then he would champion my cause to the medical journals<BR>
                                        etc. - a wonderful optimism, but nothing is further from reality!
                                    <P> Your goal is the same as mine - great you could be important to me and<BR>
                                        arc - the question is how do we get the message across?
                                    <P> On the arc pages Im asking people how to break taboos - I have several<BR>

                                        responsible for kids today not being monitored) but mainly,- I tried<BR>
                                        to break the taboo for several years and I cant do it alone - also<BR>
                                        (after ten years on the subject) I am becoming more practical and<BR>
                                        realising that even if some advance is made, its not going to be quick<BR>
                                        - male-initiation.net is pretty much alone online, there is no<BR>
                                        comparison with other sites - I have seen no other site which contains<BR>
                                        info on late initiations or which wants boys to be monitored.
                                    <P> Im 53 now, I dont intend dying in the near future, but sometime I<BR>
                                        might consider doing this !! and I do have the wish that<BR>
                                        male-initiation.net lives on ... but then it needs a group (ARC) to<BR>
                                        take over from me.
                                    <P> So, the most practical thing Im doing to get children monitored at<BR>
                                        present is trying to stimulate interest in a group ie. ARC. who could<BR>
                                        and should even now start taking management of male-initiation.net
                                    <P> I used to have a small group of about 14 with 4 who were very active,<BR>
                                        I "collected" these people during my first 6 yrs. online, then I<BR>
                                        dropped out for 4 yrs. (nervous breakdowns) and have lost all contact.<BR>
                                        Ive been back for a year now, but Nick is the only helper I have at<BR>
                                        present, he did a lot, but now is taking exams ... theres also a cool<BR>
                                        French guy who doesnt yet know that he belongs to Arc - but hes being<BR>
                                        incredibly helpful at translating all my welcome pages into French.
                                    <P> Humm I dont really know what joining ARC means - I mean you can find<BR>
                                        out what it means to you and take or give what you want. (I sometimes<BR>
                                        think it would be simpler to ask people for a 10 euro entrance fee and<BR>
                                        send them a badge -).
                                    <P> The site gets 80,000 page views per month (page views is more than<BR>
                                        hits, hits includes gifs jpgs etc.) we can reckon that 8,000 stay more<BR>
                                        than a minute 800 more than 5 minutes and maybe 80 read it for a half<BR>
                                        hour ... then you are one of the 8 per month who actually get round to<BR>
                                        writing :)
                                    <P> Cheers - thanks for writing - I really like letters like this -

                                    Dear Robin,
                                    <P> I think that what you&rsquo;ve achieved on/with this site is fantastic. Having re-read what I sent you and also looked over your website again, there are a few things worth following up on: 
                                    <P> 1)	I&rsquo;ve only just seen information on your site about &ldquo;tying up&rdquo;&hellip; I might well review my decision to do nothing&hellip; the solution is so simple!
                                    <P> 2)	I believe this procedure may have been touched on in a TV documentary I saw a year or so ago, I think it was presented by a chap called Bruce Parry.  The presenter lived with a very primitive tribe for a month or so, during which time, to gain their trust, he completely went along with, and immersed himself, in their ways.  There was no interpreter so they just communicated with gestures and so on.  Towards the end of his stay the tribesmen attempted to put a thorn through/under his frenulum.  He bottled out, with tears in his eyes!  He didn&rsquo;t seem to know what they were trying to do or why they were trying to do it.  Until seeing the information on your site, I was puzzled by it too.
                                    <P> 3)	On two of the three occasions I&rsquo;ve been in psychiatric hospital a fellow patient has expressed to me some kind of problem with their foreskin.  I hasten to say that this was without any prompting from me.  It simply wouldn&rsquo;t have crossed my mind to share in this way.
                                    <P> 4)	I wholeheartedly agree with Bob&rsquo;s submission under his &lsquo;<A HREF="../../anthropology/bob.html#start">dorsal slit</A>&rsquo; heading that &ldquo;a lot of human suffering (and hopefully also impassioned, ill-mannered contention!) would thereupon disappear from the earth&rdquo; and I would add that the frenulum should be checked at puberty and into young adulthood and tied up as necessary.  It seems to me that in becoming &ldquo;civilised&rdquo; we&rsquo;ve been in danger of neglecting some very basic anatomical maintenance needs.  The first person I spoke to following my discovery on 7th May 2005, from your website, of the frenulum language was our local vicar, a woman.  I had already written to my psychiatrist about it but I wasn&rsquo;t confident that he would see it as anything other than a problem that was for me to deal with.  As one would expect from a vicar, she was completely non-judgemental, understanding and sympathetic.  She was, however, surprised that such things weren&rsquo;t routinely checked-out when young.  I&rsquo;m sure that women see it in this simple way, and, of course, they&rsquo;re right!  (and this gives some inkling as to what was going on in Exodus 4 v25).
                                    <P> 5)	I referred to my poems as expressing matters in a &ldquo;light and more easily understandable way&rdquo;.  I&rsquo;m not sure if they are particularly light but I certainly feel that having written them I&rsquo;m carrying a lighter load.
                                    <P>(edited)                
                                    <P>The trouble has been that in the three episodes I got too confused and angry at no one understanding, including myself, what the problem was.  
                                    <P> My mental illness only showed itself, i.e. took me over, after I sought medical help and the question of circumcision had been raised by the medics.  The major part of the successful management of the mental illness has been to gain a clear understanding of foreskin problems and treatments.  It seems to me that the complexity of the issues arises because, fundamentally, the foreskin is a central part of the most intimate of interaction, of relationship, of sensitivity. And the trouble now is that I&rsquo;m convinced that I do understand what the problem was, but no one is interested because there&rsquo;s now no problem!!

                                    <P>Keep up the good work and make sure that you have time for you.

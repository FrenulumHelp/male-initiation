        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:   My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P>Dear Robin,<BR>
                                <BR>
                                You may remember about a year ago I got in touch saying I think I have Phimosis.&nbsp; Since birth I have not been able to retract my foreskin over the glands of my penis and I was recommended by you to tell my parents or see a doctor.&nbsp; After being embarrassed for a few months I decided to tell my mum who took me to the doctors.&nbsp; After attempting to stretch my foreskin, I still couldn&rsquo;t retract it and so I knew I had to do something.<BR>
                                <BR>
                                After visiting the doctors last year he sent me to a specialist for advice.&nbsp; After speaking to a specialist he offered me 3 solutions: Leave it, circumcision or some partial surgery which leaves the foreskin on but fully retractable.&nbsp; Of course I decided to have the partial one and nearly a year later I finally have my operation date.&nbsp; I am undergoing general aesthetic and hopefully I will be sorted out.&nbsp; I have never had an operation before, and because this is my first and on a weird place, I am very nervous about it.<BR>
                                <BR>
                                I have sent this email to thank you for persuading me to tell someone and visit a doctor.&nbsp;

                              <P>Hello Steve,
                              
                              <P>Im sorry I dont remember you, But if I advised talking with your parents then it sounds like I reponded like a responsible person (my parents would be proud of me :) ... Im 53! ) and you must be around 16 yrs. old or so ... Glad you at least tried stretching ...</P>
                              <P>Partial surgery, a partial circumcision, is generally the best option,<BR>
                                ie I believe there is more chance of you being happy with the results.</P>
                              <P>Yes, I remember the night before my operation I dreamt of a doctor<BR>
                                wielding an axe ... Seen practically this is an incredibly simple<BR>
                                operation - seen emotionally it is sure to bring out all the old<BR>
                                Freudian fears of castration etc ...</P>
                              <P>What actually interests me is how did you find out you had a problem<BR>
                                and what it was? ... I think you can be happy that you live post<BR>
                                internet ... previously there was no information ... I took till I was<BR>
                                43 till I discovered what I had and how to cure it!</P>
                              <P>The point of writing your experience for my site, is not so much to<BR>
                                help other teenagers or adults to get treated ... it is to make it<BR>
                                obvious to the medical profession that these problems must be checked<BR>
                                and sorted out before puberty.</P>
                              <P>anyway god luck for the big day ...</P>
                              <P>cheers<BR>

                              <P>Hi Robin </P>
                              <P>Thanks!  I found out from simple diagrams in science etc that they were all<BR>
                                the same and I never seen one like mine.  I thought about it and I figured<BR>
                                out that just by looking at the 'mechanics' of it, it wouldn&rsquo;t work properly<BR>
                                during sex!</P>

                                Hi Steve, so it wasnt even in sex education, but how interesting, even<BR>
                                the science books these days have diagrams of things which 20<BR>
                                yrs. ago were very private and tabood ... hummm the education system<BR>
                              is slowly improving !!</P>
                              <P>rob.</P>
                              <P>_____________________________________________</P>
                              <P>Hi Robin,</P>
                              <P>......edited</P>
                              <P>Whilst I have been resting at home I have been browsing the forums to do<BR>
  with male parts and I didn't realise how common it is in people between<BR>
                              the ages of 13-23 or so.  The people/lads have had exactly the same<BR>
                                experiences as me.  I think something should be done to raise awareness earlier<BR>
because I'm really quite shocked!!</P>
                              <P>Anyway thanks for your help il keep you informed<BR>
  Steve</P>
                              <P>___________________________________________________</P>
                              <P>Hey Steve,</P>
                              <P>....edited</P>
                              <P>And youve been browsing the forums. And I feel thats the spirit Steve,<BR>
                                get shocked by it, at 16, glad to see a social conscience developing ....<BR>
                                Boys must be monitored before puberty, once you are of school age they<BR>
                                check if yer balls are hanging properly, at the same time they should<BR>
                                check the foreskin. This would not only be a practical measure, but<BR>
                                simply because its done, it would raise awareness of the problem.</P>
                              <P>You say ages 13-23 ... this is only after internet!!! previously it was<BR>
                                ages 18-30 ... Im guessing, but for example I have a real hard case, I<BR>
                                discovered I had a problem first when I was 43 yrs. old. The<BR>
                                information was simply not available before internet was there. I<BR>
                                experienced a lot of sexual confusion in my life with all my intimate<BR>
                              relationships ... I believed it was a psychological problem ...</P>
                              <P>The doctors, the medical studies etc. show no awareness (except in<BR>
                                perhaps 3 studies among 200) of sexual problems developing because of<BR>
                                phimosis, the medical profession see phimosis as a purely practical<BR>
                                problem.</P>
                              <P>Whereas in my experience it started being a problem right at the<BR>
                                beginning of puberty, when I couldnt masturbate normally.</P>
                              <P>Hummm theres lots I could write ... what dya wanna do?</P>
                              <P>What do I need to do to get young people supporting this project??</P>
                              <P>cheers<BR>
                              and I hope you soon start feeling happy<BR>

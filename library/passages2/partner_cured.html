        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P> Written by Tina at 30 Aug 2001 Forum2 </P>
                              <P>I met a wonderful guy 3 years ago but sadly we split up 6 months ago  &amp; probably it had someting to do with his problem &amp; the result  of being 'cured' or made to feel a man again.</P>
                              <P> When we 1st went to bed he wouldn't let me masturbate him because he  'had a problem' in that his foreskin wouldn't retract. He had  difficulty reaching orgasm although after 3 weeks he did but only after  lots of rapid thrusts but with no deep penetration.When with his  ex-wife before they were married he had experienced bleeding so was  frightened to get over excited.</P>
                              <P> He was then 36 when we met, had only slept with his ex-wife with whom  he'd had sex from 17, but he had 2 kids from the marriage.I told him it  was no big deal &amp; made him promise to see his GP whilst I was away  in the States for a week. He did see the GP &amp; after 6 months got a  call to go to the local hospital. </P>
                              <P> I went with him &amp; he had a general anaesthetic, was in surgery  about an hour &amp; we went home a couple of hours later, all they did  was separate the bit that was attached &amp; put in 2 stitches. After  about 5 weeks he'd healed &amp; could get the foreskin to retract but  it was still tight to get back &amp; we had to use lube to help ease it  back. It never got so it would just retract by itself. It always needed  assistance &amp; was still tight round the glans.</P>
                              <P> All was well until after about 9 months he seemed to mentally change -  he started flirting with women, grew in confidence &amp; eventually he  found someone else. He is now not the guy I knew or loved - he acts  like he's god's gift to women, he's had his ear pierced (which he  couldn't bear the thought of before), changed his lifestyle completely  &amp; acts like he's 20 something again.</P>
                              <P> Good luck to him I suppose in trying to catch up on all those lost  years. Would he have stuck with his ex-wife from 17 if he wasn't so  embarrassed &amp; she lived with it. I couldn't live with it &amp;  tried to support &amp; help but in the end feel cheated. I fixed his  sex life &amp; he walked away with a big grin.</P>
                              <P> Just a message to the guys &amp; their partners to really talk through  how it might change things. It did change our sex life marvellously but  I didn't bargain for the change it would bring about in him &amp; he  didn't either. </P>                              </TD>

        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                            <TD><P><B>PHYSICIAN with CONTRICTING RING AROUND FORESKIN</B>
                                                            <P> I loved your website.  Just thought I would share my story so that <BR>
                                it may help other people. I am a physician, never circumsized, who <BR>
                                had phimosis well into my 30's.  I eventually developed a white <BR>
                                contricting ring around the end of my foreskin that eventually <BR>
                                prevented the skin from being retractable.  
                              <P> I assure you that if anyone with this problem goes to a regular <BR>
                                urologist in "general urology" practice the urologist would <BR>
                                immediately recommend circumcision.  But, that is NOT the only <BR>
                                solution.  Fortunately for me, I went to a major univervisty <BR>
                                medical center where I was referred to a pediatric urologist (even <BR>
                                though I was 35 years old).  The fact of the matter is that the <BR>
  "general urologist" does not do much work on the foreskin itself <BR>
                                (they usually work on prostate, kidneys, etc)  The subspecialist <BR>
                                you really need to see is called a "pediatric urologist" - they <BR>
                                are basically plastic surgeons of the penis.  He offered me <BR>
                                excision of about a one centimeter ring of skin around my foreskin <BR>
                                to relieve the tight constricting band and PRESERVE the remainder <BR>
                                of my foreskin.  It worked great!  
                              <P> Remember, the "general urologist" will not mess around with doing <BR>
                                any type of more complex surgery that a standard circumcision - <BR>
                                its easy for them and they won't even entertain the possibility of <BR>
                                excision of a one centimeter ring.  My suggestion - find the <BR>
                                biggest name major university in your state and call the <BR>
                                department of urology - ask for the name of a pediatric urologist <BR>
                                and write him a letter stating your case.  He may be willing to <BR>
                                see you even if you are an adult.  Its worth the effort!! Tell <BR>
                                them you want to see someone in their department who has alot of <BR>
                                experience in plastic surgical procedures on the penile skin - the <BR>
                                only one who fits the bill is a true university "pediatric <BR>
                              urologist".                               
                              <P>Good luck.<BR>

                                <P>___________________________________________________                                
                                <P>Hello T,
                              <P> I always maintained that doctors do not belong to a special species where such problems have been deselected :) - so welcome to the club.                              
                              <P>It would be really helpful if you would mention some of the sexual problems you had with this &quot;phimosis&quot; and why it was necessary to get it treated - such information coming from a doctor would be particularly helpful, especially if I could use your full name. 
                              <P> And, 
                              very interesting, --- but you have just complicated one of my most beautiful simple answers to partial circumcision  - I was suggesting if they want respectful treatment with simple tested methods that people find a Jewish doctor - who I imagine "love" to perform this operation - (which re:Genesis, is their primary bond to God). 
                              <P> I am amazed that you seem to come from the USA - maybe Canada or Australia? The pediatric doctors in the USA have a pretty bad reputation for "whipping it off"  - <BR>
                                  I must say I dont think yours is a universal option, do YOU think this would also be the case in every modern country? - Also Im not quite sure under what circumstances a doctor calls himself a physician, but do you think because you are in the trade that you got through red tape and waiting lists? 
                              <P> In the UK there was a mother who paid 1,200 pounds to get her son preputial plasty in London, (she travelled from Bristol 3 times to see him) and recently someone spent 2,000 pounds just for a normal circumcision after waiting 2 years on the NHS. So its amazing the effort people are willing to go to, to get good treatment and I MUST ask for the name of your operator and the hospital where he works. (Im sure if you have any doubts, if you ask him, he would be all too pleased about you handing his name out and complimenting his work).
                              <P> I must admit, this is the first time I have heard of such a delightfully simple free treatment, - have we really arrived in the 21st. century? - I just feel very sceptical that all pediatric urologists will not be trained like yours. It would be a really good idea if you could even ask him directly where he was trained, and who else uses his methods?
                              <P> I totally agree with you on Urologists and I always try to recommend Surgeons, - what about pediatric surgeons? are pediatric urologists maybe the better option?
                              <P> Thanks for a stimulating letter<BR>
                                  Cheers<BR>

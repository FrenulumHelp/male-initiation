        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:   My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P>Dear Robin,
                              <P>You ask &ldquo;how to get the message across?&rdquo;  I think the issues are very difficult to separate but I find my poetry makes connections and expresses very deep human psyche matters in a light and hopefully more easily understandable way.  Having said this, I believe that each poem needs some explanation in order really to get inside the subject. 
                              <P> There is a big connection, I feel, with the thicket in which Abrahams ram got stuck (as I&rsquo;m from a farming family is quite easy to visualise the ram&rsquo;s behaviour on being stuck in this way), with the &ldquo;crown of thorns&rdquo; and with phimosis/frenulum problems, which kind of makes sense &ndash; ( We all have our cross to bear (i.e. everyone about anything) and We have our crown of thorns to wear <BR>
                                <BR>

                                    We all have our cross to bear;<BR>
                                    And we have our crown o' thorns t' wear:<BR>
                                    Like Abraham's ram caught in the thicket,<BR>
                                    Substituted for His Son...<BR>
                                    .. .and taken to the sacrificial table.

                                Breaking the Law.  Foreskins and circumcision seem to run all the way through the Bible and the legal technicality (i.e. working on the Sabbath) upon which the Pharisees decided that Jesus was &ldquo;trouble&rdquo;, was really interesting to me because as Jesus correctly points out, circumcision takes place on the eighth day after birth and therefore can take place on the Sabbath.  The poem finishes with my own &ldquo; healing&rdquo; which was enabled by a chance encounter with a faith healer when I was in the midst of my dreadful breakdown in 1984.

                                <P> Jesus:  &ldquo;Circumcision (i.e. healing) on the eighth day:<BR>
                                  It happens on the Sabbath.&rdquo;<BR>
                                  The Pharisees didn&rsquo;t like it,<BR>
                                  Such a practical riposte.
                                <P> Prevention is better than cure,<BR>
                                  But oh how the legal language<BR>
                                  Is confusing the ritual benefit:<BR>
                                We&rsquo;re going to need a sage.

                                <P><I> So why not on the Sabbath?<BR>
                                  It doesn&rsquo;t make any sense:<BR>
                                  Prevention is surely a healing<BR>
                                  With just a future tense.</I>
                                <P><I> But is it right to presuppose that,<BR>

                              <P> Sarah&rsquo;s Laugh Lasts and Confucius He Say: By Sarah, Reading the whole story of Abraham is probably really the only way to get into them.  They stem from stripping the story right down:  Sara was allegedly barren but when Abraham eventually worked out to do the op, and did it, Sarah gave birth within a year.  This leads to the very simple conclusion that it was Abraham that had the problem (and he was concious of it even if not initally understanding it), not Sara (i.e. the presumption that she was barren is a completely typical male reaction.. (not necessarily Abraham's.. and one can understand slave-girl Hager's perspective, i.e. that if the boss's wants her have a child she'd best make sure that she gets pregnant..)).<BR>

                                  I was wondering what it was<BR>
                                  That was with Hagar&rsquo;s way?

                                  And I&rsquo;m beginning to doubt:<BR>
                                  They may have got it together<BR>
                                  But did Abe&rsquo;s seed come out?

                                  I think that she is rumbled:<BR>
                                  She and Ish have gone away,<BR>
                                  And avoided thus being humbled.

                                  I think that he&rsquo;s confused<BR>
                                  Which boy is his first boy<BR>
                                  And which to disabuse.
                                <P> There&rsquo;s nothing I can say<BR>
                                  T&rsquo;would make any difference<BR>
                                  He&rsquo;s nurtured both as &lsquo;is own:<BR>
                                  He has no preference.
                                <P> Ishmael&rsquo;s long since gone away,<BR>
                                  About which Abe feels guilty<BR>
                                  There&rsquo;s nothing much that I can say<BR>
                                  I&rsquo;m trusting that he&rsquo;s not faulty.
                                <P> He and &lsquo;Saac have gone on a trip<BR>
                                  To make a sacrifice<BR>
                                  If I knew then what was in store<BR>
                                  He&rsquo;d not have had the chance.
                                <P> &ldquo;Dad had a little moment there,<BR>

                                  Just as Cain with Abel.&rdquo;

                                  What was he thinking of?!&rdquo;
                                <P> - &ldquo;Confusion reign, it was his pain<BR>
                                  Of how to deal with love.
                                <P> Luckily there, the ecology deep,<BR>
                                  Came to our rescue,<BR>
                                  A ram was in the brambles and<BR>
                                  Was pushing the thorns on cue.
                                <P> Faith supreme is the lesson here<BR>
                                  One really mustn&rsquo;t wobble,<BR>
                                  For what is meant to be<BR>
                                  Will be, I&rsquo;d advise against a squabble.&rdquo;
                                <P> I had to think and weigh things up <BR>
                                  After all he&rsquo;d given to me,<BR>
                                  The social services were involved:<BR>
                                  They decided to see Saacs&rsquo; plea.
                                <P> If they&rsquo;d not accepted this,<BR>
                                  Nor understood the mitigation,<BR>
                                  We&rsquo;d not have the lesson that<BR>
                                  Is how to join One Kingdom.

                                Do my musings simply confirm that my interest and understanding of the subject of a problem foreskin are signs of mental illness, or is mental illness a sign of a foreskin problem, or is it simply the case that there is no possibility of there being any correlation between the condition and the disorder?  Those, I guess, are the key questions&hellip;

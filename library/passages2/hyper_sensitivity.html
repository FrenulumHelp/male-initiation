        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              </B>
                              <P> Hi anyone with a hypersensitive glans
                              <P> "In my experience that sensitivity is not even<BR>
                                suppressed by the anaesthetic gel that they gave<BR>
                                me post-op. I think you just have to deal with it<BR>
                                until it has been exposed for some time."
                              <P> This is a similar question to "how to dissolve<BR>
                                epithelial adhesions?" in that it asks about<BR>
                                keratinisation. I always hoped that someone with a<BR>
                                hypersensitive glans would give us a clue about<BR>
                                the epithelium and I noticed your BSc so perhaps<BR>
                                you understand chemistry.
                              <P> I did a search on my site for hyper, it seems a<BR>
                                lot of questions but no really good answers.
                              <P> on post circ problems:
                                <BR>
                                An alternative (experiment) may be using oil of<BR>
                                cloves, possibly diluted with olive oil
                              <P> and from library/passages/hyper-sensitivity.html
                              <P> "Is there any way to speed this up? (ie. the<BR>
                                process of hardening up the glans)"
                              <P> interesting question, if you wanted a quick<BR>
                                temporary method try an aneasthetic cream, they<BR>
                                make it numb, ... as a permanent method,  ?<BR>
                                *thinks* you need a cock bath .. :-) ... (Nescafe<BR>
                                jar, full of warm  water insert cock and hang<BR>
                                loose for ten minutes ... we need a secret<BR>
                                ingredient, there must be something, but I have no<BR>
                                idea what - how  does one speed up keratinisation<BR>
                                i.e. hardening up the glans, I believe  that the<BR>
                                most sensible may be to bathe your glans in your<BR>
                                own fresh  urine,... for further stimulating<BR>
                                discussions on the subject I would  suggest you<BR>
                                check out and write to us on the mailing list or<BR>

        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P>
                                <!-- Anfang BeitragsText -->
                                Dear Robin,
                              <P> I was doing some research and I would be very appreciative if you could help <BR>
                                me.  A book I purchased here in New York City, titled Circumcision: A <BR>
                                History of the World's Most Controversial Surgery, contained the following <BR>
                                passage:
                              <P> >"For the better part of two thousand years, Jewish circumsion followed a<BR>
  >three-step pattern.  First was chituch, the cutting of the stretched<BR>
  >foreskin.  Then came periah, the complete exposure of the glans effected by<BR>
  >cutting or tearing away all the inner foreskin tissue back to the frenulum.<BR>
  >Finally, with the operation finished, came mezizah, a practice in which the<BR>
  >mohel sucked the blood from the wounded penish until the bleeding stopped. <BR>
  >.<BR>
  >. .  The surgery was not finished.  To accomplish the periah and complete<BR>
  >the denudation of the glans, the mohel set aside his instruments and used<BR>
  >only his thumbnail, long, lancet-shaped, filed to the sharpest possible<BR>
  >edge. . . .  Mezizah b'peh followed immediately, the mohel taking the<BR>
  >bleeding penis in his mouth, sucking the blood, then turning to take<BR>
  >mouthfuls of wine from a goblet and spitting this wine on the infant's<BR>
  >wound."
                              <P> The author, David Gollaher, gives the following citation for this account:
                              <P> "F. Bryk, Circumcision in Man and Woman (1934), 49.  Bryk's account is drawn <BR>
                                from H. Ploss, Das Kind in Brauch und Sitte der Voelker (1884)."
                              <P> Mr. Gollaher is a medical historian with a PhD. in history from Harvard <BR>
                                University.
                              <P> But, when I asked Douglas Rushkoff, a professor of communications at New <BR>
                                York University (where I am a student) and apparent scholar of Jewish <BR>
                                history, about the passage, he maintained it was a myth created to provoke <BR>
                                anti-Semitism and bears a resemblance to a fabrication in the "Protocals of <BR>
                                the Elders of Zion".  I cannot read German, and I have been unable to find <BR>
                                an English translation of Ploss's work or any English commentary <BR>
                                thereof--except for your website.  (I have been unable to locate Mr. <BR>
                                Gollaher.)
                              <P> And so I must ask if you would be so kind as to help me.  Essentially, I <BR>
                                have two separate questions:<BR>
                                1-Does Ploss indeed refer to that "mezizah b'peh", the sucking of the blood <BR>
                                and spitting of the wine?<BR>
                                2-Is Ploss suspected of espousing anti-Semitic views?
                              <P> Gollaher, the modern author, maintains that the practice was an ancient one <BR>
                                not practiced by Jews today, of course; Rushkoff, who came across as rather <BR>
                                incensed at the suggestion, claims it was NEVER practiced.<BR>
                                Who is correct?  Could it be the case that only certain Jewish tribes, or <BR>
                                more isolated/rural communities practiced the ritual?
                              <P> I would greatly appreciate your response.
                              <P> Thank you<BR>

                              <P>Dear Chris,</P>
                              <P>---- edited ---- (see <A HREF="../../ploss.html#start">Ploss</A> and <A HREF="../../bryk.html#start">Bryk</A>) </P>
                              <P>There are so many "pro-circers" who are interested<BR>
                                in such matters that I have never considered it<BR>
                                important for me to get involved with, or gather<BR>
                                information ... so I am absolutely no expert with different <BR>
                                methods of circumcision. </P>
                              <P>---- edited ----                              </P>
                              <P> .....  it does NOT seem anti semitic to me ...
                              it even seems <BR>
                              obvious and intelligent, I cant see anything wrong or <BR>embarrassing about it 
                              
                              <P> Sucking blood (pre AIDS) was a very intelligent<BR>
                                and common sense thing to do, I believe saliva is a natural <BR>
                                antiseptic, ..... and I find it absolutely no insult to the Jews.<BR>
                                or any other historic people ... 
                              <P> Also, cutting things with a finger nail may sound barbaric <BR>
                                or maybe even stupid to us, but the finger nail is a<BR>
                              very useful  tool for cutting  soft things (skin - fruits or fish) <BR>
                              and 4 or 5 thousand years ago would arguably
                              allow <BR>greater accuracy than any held piece of equipment
                              
                              <P> As guitar teacher Im always explaining to people<BR>
                                that one doesnt play with the nail:- the nail is<BR>
                                led and felt/stroked/guided over the string by the very<BR>
                                sensitive finger tips - previous to magnifying<BR>
                                glasses and all the modern equipment I would<BR>
                                suggest there was no more accurate and sensitive<BR>
                                cutting equipment for soft things.
                              <P> And now two personal confessions or experiences:                               
                              <P>Around 30 years ago as a farm worker, someone cut his eye, <BR>
                                blood everywhere, and imagine his shock - everyones<BR>
                                hands were dirty in a field, a mile away from civilisation - <BR>
                                so I sucked his eye clean, ... everyone seemed astounded <BR>
                                by my action, I never really questioned why this was so unusual,<BR>
                              ..... 
                               I didnt like the taste, I wouldnt do it since AIDS, <BR>
                               but the guy was so very relieved to find that nothing <BR>
                               wrong with his eye. - and so, this all seemed to me a<BR>
                               natural and good spontaneous reaction. ....<BR>
                                Also, Im sure every Mum has done this to her children <BR>
                                sometime when they bleed. .. so, experience no.2 ...
                              
                              <P> As I said, I am a guitarist, I have long finger<BR>
                                nails on the right hand, but the thumb nail kept<BR>
                                breaking because I used it to do things.... and <BR>
                              so because it kept breaking on the valuable right<BR>
                              hand, I started growing my thumb nail long on the <BR>left hand! 
                              <P> I would be lost without my thumb nail, I do<BR>
                                hundreds of little things with it - screw driver,<BR>
                                stuck selotape picker, breaking holes in alu folie<BR>
                                to get to the drinks, picking black spots out of<BR>
                                potatoes and apples, everyone envies how I can peel<BR> 
                                oranges! ... with garlic I cut through<BR>
                                the tip and root with my thumb nail - what else -<BR>
                                harvesting sorrel from my garden I sometimes have<BR>
                                cut through the stem with my thumb nail but must<BR>
                                admit here the modern "scissors" invention seems<BR>
                                quite useful (perhaps they will even catch on,<BR>
                                sometime in the future, :). ... I have never really<BR>
                                considered sharpening the nail to a fine cutting<BR>
                              edge, humm but maybe this would be an interesting<BR>improvement.
                              <P>And I have never compared my experience with women <BR>
                                with long nails but I imagine that modern stylish women <BR>
                                are far too precious to use their nails in the way I do 
                              
                              <P> The thumb nail is by far the strongest nail, and I<BR>
                                would bet that many historic peoples knew this and<BR>
                                - have used it to perform circumcision. and I find<BR>
                                this was very very obvious and intelligent !! :)
                              <P> I suppose in the modern world everyone else buys a <BR>
                                plastic thumb nail gadget to do all these little<BR>
                                jobs ... :):) 
                              <P> Cheers<BR>

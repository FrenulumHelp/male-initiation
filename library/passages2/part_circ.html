        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                            <TD><P>(...just a general comment ... note how  the exception, i.e. the non-circ'd boy  is called &quot;Jewish&quot; ???)                            
                              <P><B>MY PARTIAL CIRCUMCISION 
                                </B>
                              
                              <P> When I was 6, I had a friend who  had a complete circumcision. I was intact at the time. We examined  each others penis at the time. He pulled me back with no problem. He  stated that some day I would awake and I would be bare just like his.  All my mothers good friends had sons that had complete circumcisions as  did my younger brother at this time. My dad was not circumcised. All  the kids in my class except me were circumcised. I went on a sunday  school class camp-out for a week and was the only one not circumcised.  They jokingly called me jewish because of my penis.</P>
                                <P> I was the only intact kid in my 6th grade class. During spring break I  had my toncils removed. I was also circumcised at this time. I was  unware with any problems with my penis as it retracted okay. I guess  this was done so I would be like all the other kids. I was totally  unaware of this surgery until it was time to have the stitches removed.  I had been sewed up with this skin forward. The first time it was  pulled back by the doctor it really hurt. I do not remember any thing  about my penis after that. I recall when they were getting me ready for  my toncils the nurse carefully washed my penis. I had no idea why this  was done at the time.</P>
                                <P> I now was different. At scout camp the intact boys considered me to be  circumcised wile the circumcised boys treated as being uncircumcised. I  went through highschool like this but with no problems. The circumcised  kids all had complete circumcisions. The intact kids all had a little  over hang while I had none. I never saw penis like mine.</P>
                                <P> The same was true in college and while in the Air Force. The only  circumcision like mine that I saw belong to a Rabbi I had seened with  on many occasions. He left his skin forward (atleast 90% covering)  while going. I always pulled mine all the way back. I have often  wondered what he thought when seeing me.</P>
                                <P> After some time I got where I concidered myself to be un-circumcised.  That came down on me the first time my girl friend saw by exclaiming "I  see you are circumcised". This was a little surprising in that her year  old son had a total circ as did his father. We were married for 6 years  and had one child , a daughter. In big red letters on the doctors board  when she was born; did not circumcise.</P>
                                <P> My second and present wife, we have been married 37 years, also made  that same comment the first time she saw me. We had the only boys (2)  in the hospital who were not circumcised. The hospital bill : Circumcision $120.</P>
                                <P> After reading all the comments I have seen in your website I guess I am  glad I have my partial circumcision. My frenulum was not touched duing  my circumcision. Another interesting point is that 3 jewish friends of  mine that I have noticed have about as much skin as I have and do not  pull it back while going.</P>
                                <P> I have noticed just recently (I always pulled myself all the way back  when going) that if I just get my penis out and go without pulling it  back that my penis is only about 80% to 90% covered even though it is  completely covered whem I get undressed to take my shower.</P>
                                <P> I guess the old style jewish circumcision to only cut the tip of the  foreskin off for their circumcision which does not try to pull the skin  loose that is attached to the head for 2 or 3 years, is the way to do  things. From what I have read a jewish circ job takes only and few  seconds and does not leave the baby screaming. I guess I have a jewish  circumcision at 10 1/2 years age but with 6 stitches. I am completely  satisfied with my circumcised penis the way it is and am glad that is  was done. I just wonder what it would have been like if the doctor had  sewed me up with the skin pulled back.</P>
                                <P> I thought you might be interested in my circumcision for your web page.<BR>

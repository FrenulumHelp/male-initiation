        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P> Dear Robin,
                              <P> I am 27 years old and I seem to have a lack of <BR>
                                sensitivity when engaging in sexual intercourse.
                              <P> I've come up with several theories as to why this is but <BR>
                                have neglected to seek advise from a physician. Due to a <BR>
                                somewhat repressive family environment I've felt unable to <BR>
                                discuss this problem until recently. I am uncircumsized and <BR>
                                have, what appears to be scar tissue around the shaft of my <BR>
                                penis, just below the head. My mother remembers the doctor <BR>
                                claiming that my circumsicion was complicated, implying <BR>
                                that there was at least an attempt to circumsize me. I have <BR>
                                a full layer of foreskin that conceals the head of my penis <BR>
                                when flaccid. I've theorized that the doctor may have <BR>
                                sliced me without actually removing any skin, hence the <BR>
                                scar tissue. I've never had any problem reaching a climax <BR>
                                from masturbation. Yet, when engaged in intercourse, (while <BR>
                                NOT completely impossible), I feel unstimulated by the lack <BR>
                                of sensitivity and end up losing my "inspiration". I <BR>
                                generally don't have a problem maintaining an erection <BR>
                                unless I start to feel fatigued from trying so hard. I have <BR>
                                had orgasms from intercourse but it's always been a arduous <BR>
                                process and usually involves my partner increasing the <BR>
  "kinky-ness" levels. Could there be any psychological <BR>
                                reasons for this type of dysfunction or Could my <BR>
                                dysfunction be attributed to the scar tissue? Any help or <BR>
                                advise would be greatly appreciated. -x
                              <P><B>_____________________________________________________</B>                              
                              <P>Hello,
                              <P> Im sorry about this one, but I just dont understand the explanation. The <BR>
                                scar tissue may indicate skin bridge, which can occur as a sheet of skin. 
                              <P> >I am uncircumsized and <BR>
                                have, what appears to be scar tissue around the shaft of my <BR>
                                penis, just below the head.  
                              <P> You make no mention of pain or discomfort. Only lack of sensitivity. 
                              <P> >My mother remembers the doctor claiming that my circumsicion was <BR>
                                complicated,
                              <P> A  possible conclusion from what you write is that the operating <BR>
                                doctor made a mess of things, you may have apost circumcision phimosis ... or maybe the doc could have even damaged a couple of <BR>
                                nerves? I would check this theory with maybe a nurologist before <BR>
                                starting to question your own psychology.
                              <P>&gt; I have a full layer of foreskin that conceals the head of my penis <BR>
when flaccid. 
                              <P>You have a condition which is practically the same as pinhole phimosis, - i.e. your foreskin completely covers your glans. The glans and particularly under the glans the frenulum area is arguably the most sensitive area of the penis - However yours is covered, a bit like wearing gloves 
                              - and therefore less sensitive - You need some sort of treatment - but I would need better desriptions or pictures to advise.
                              <P> Good Luck<BR>
                                Robin

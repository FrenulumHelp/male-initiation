        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                                <!-- Anfang BeitragsText -->
                                Hi Robin, first I'd just like to say thanks for putting <BR>
                                such a useful and helpful site up.
                              <P> Im going to attempt to make this as short as possible <BR>
                                since its quite a long one and I apologies in advance for <BR>
                                taking up your time. 
                              <P> Since my childhood my father realized that I might have <BR>
                                problems with an elongated penis foreskin (I wont use <BR>
                                scientific terms since I frequently get confused)....
                              
                              <P> I went to see a specialist at the age of ten who proposed <BR>
                                circumcision. Of course I resisted. I seem to remember my <BR>
                                father telling me that I should try to exercise my foreskin <BR>
                                by pulling it back. I did just that one night at Boarding <BR>
                                School and it of course got stuck in that position. It was <BR>
                                a hellish day or two and my penis swelled up. I was then <BR>
                                sent down to hospital where a Doctor fixed the problem.<BR>
                                Since then I was afraid of pulling my foreskin back. Not <BR>
                                being able to pull my foreskin back didnt stop me from <BR>
                                masturbating and I grew used to masturbating that way (I <BR>
                                will return to this later).
                              <P> For years I didnt realize anything was wrong. I was a later <BR>
                                starter with the opposite sex. Even at the age of 20 when I <BR>
                                first had sex I didnt realize that my foreskin was supposed <BR>
                                to retract whilst I was erect. The problem became clearer <BR>
                                to me by my mid 20's when I started to believe that some <BR>
                                men's foreskins retracted whilst erect and others didnt and <BR>
                                both were normal. (Im still not clear on this today). <BR>
                                However a much more serious thing became apparent - I was <BR>
                                seemingly unable to ejaculate during sex with a woman even <BR>
                                though I could masturbate to orgasm alone. This remains the <BR>
                                case up until the present day.
                              <P> During my mid 20's I visited a sexual counselor to try to <BR>
                                remedy this problem. I told the sexual counselor that as a <BR>
                                child at the school I was abused. It happened at the age of <BR>
                                12 when the abuser masturbated me to orgasm. It happened <BR>
                                once and I thought this might be the reason for inability <BR>
                                to achieve orgasm during sex.. The counselor suggested that <BR>
                                I cease masturbation altogether which I did for a time but it <BR>
                                made no difference when I had sexual encounters. I moved <BR>
                                and havent seen anybody professional since.
                              <P> I am now 32 and today the situation is no better. In fact <BR>
                                in a way its getting worse. For some reason upon occasion I <BR>
                                am unable to achieve erection at all when with a woman. Is <BR>
                                it because I'm already pretty sure that there will be no <BR>
                                sexual satisfaction for myself I dont know?
                              <P> But to return to the physiological side, when erect my <BR>
                                foreskin still doesnt retract but I can pull it back and it <BR>
                                doesnt hurt. However, I dont know how much pulled back it <BR>
                                should be or if that linkage of skin on the bottom side of <BR>
                                my penis is supposed to be there or how long it should be. <BR>
                                Since my early childhood I have also always retained urine <BR>
                                after urinating and it continues to this day.
                              <P> Imp sorry to get bogged down in the sexual side since I <BR>
                                think your specialty is the physical but I dont know how <BR>
                                connected these things are. Are the two things separate?<BR>
                                Imp not sure what condition I have.
                              <P> I dont need to tell you that Im pretty afraid about the <BR>
                                whole thing and I dont know where to start or who to turn <BR>
                                to. If you could give me any advice at all I would be so <BR>
                                grateful. I childishly believed that one day it would all <BR>
                                just go right for me with the right woman and the clock is <BR>
                                ticking.
                              <P> S.
                              <P> PS I have tried to self diagnose using your and other <BR>
                                websites on the internet. I dont know if its phimosis I <BR>
                                have or frenulum breve or something else.
                              <P><B>___________________</B></P>
                              <P>Hello S, </P>
                              <P> My site is very interested in sex, so you dont need to apologise. 
                              <P> Your letter was so near my own feelings - particularly<BR>
  >I childishly believed that one day it would all <BR>
  >just go right for me with the right woman and the clock is <BR>
  >ticking.
                              <P> I will take it point by point, and first :  
                              <P> >Since my childhood my father realized that I might have <BR>
  >problems with an elongated penis foreskin (I wont use <BR>
  >scientific terms since I frequently get confused).<BR>
  >I believe this was a problem that ran in the family. In <BR>
  >fact my father I believe only also had one functional <BR>
  >testicle.<BR>
  >I went to see a specialist at the age of ten who proposed <BR>
  >circumcision. Of course I resisted. 
                              <P> actually in a sense this is a shame because it would have solved practically all of your later problems, however now youve got this far I believe you can avoid treatment with a full circumcision.
                              <P> >I seem to remember my <BR>
  >father telling me that I should try to exercise my foreskin <BR>
  >by pulling it back. I did just that one night at Boarding <BR>
  >School and it of course got stuck in that position. It was <BR>
  >a hellish day or two and my penis swelled up. I was then <BR>

                              <P> Shame that your Dad told you to stretch by pulling backwards, he should have advised pulling outwards,... but hes not to blame.
                              <P> And well, this is the start of the whole story, the doctor got rid of a paraphimosis, (some technical terms are necessary, paraphimosis: when the ring at the front of the inner foreskin, gets trapped behind the glans) but then left you with the condition. Paraphimosis is fairly common, and doctors usually treat it &acute;(mostly with an emergency circumcision or at least dorsal slit)                               
                              <P>This doctor must have been crazy to relieve the emergency but then leave you with the possibility of repeating the problem the next time you retracted your foreskin! - Naturally you were scared of this (as any intelligent boy would be), and you avoided pulling your foreskin back in future  (as any intelligent boy would), . - ( there was nothing wrong with your psychology at this point - this reaction was common sense ... it was the doctor who was crazy to leave you with the potential to get paraphimosis again and again ...)
                              <P> >Since then I was afraid of pulling my foreskin back. Not <BR>
  >being able to pull my foreskin back didnt stop me from <BR>
  >masturbating and I grew used to masturbating that way (I <BR>
  >will return to this later).

                              <P> I myself and hundreds of other men who have these problems arent/werent sure of this, and its not surprising because our culture teaches us that we're all normal - anyone thinking the contrary is labelled as having a psychological problem. We accept this even to the point where we label ourselves as having a psychological problem, rather than even dare to consider that something physical is wrong.
                              <P> The fact is :- A normal foreskin will retract without problems in flaccid and erect states - 
                              <P> >However a much more serious thing became apparent - I was <BR>
  >seemingly unable to ejaculate during sex with a woman even <BR>
  >though I could masturbate to orgasm alone. This remains the <BR>
  >case up until the present day.
                              <P> Slowly it seems the psychological problems start to take over and increase the physical complications. 
                              <P> >During my mid 20's I visited a sexual counselor to try to <BR>

                              <P> As in my own experience the sexual counsellors merely confirm that the problem is psychological and thus make the problems worse, they are complete idiots when advising on phimosis, they simply have never learent anything about it - and so judge based on all their years of learning about parental and environmental problems.
                              <P> The experience of abuse is obviously going to complicate the whole process, and maybe confirm the fear for sex ... however the anatomical experience of fear in your own body, seems far more primary than that of another boy(?) and only once,during schoolday. I consider (particularly in boarding school) that abuse from older boys happens fairly often more than once, but most of the kids grow up still able to have good sex.
                              <P> >I am now 32 and today the situation is no better. In fact <BR>

                              <P> Im not surprised with all the fear and then the added confirmation from experts that then you became impotent ... again, its about the only sensible reaction your body and mind can have : to avoid the whole damn situation - just give up and forget it! (I am serious, I find this an intelligent and sensitive reaction in an intolerably crazy situation)
                              <P> >But to return to the physiological side, when erect my <BR>

                              <P> I dont know either, this linkage of skin is maybe a frenulum, maybe a skin bridge, (is it a string or a sheet of skin?) you might have a short frenulum, however the first problem is the ring which caused the paraphimosis

                              <P> These two things are very strongly connected and interdependant - (and I am far more interested in sexuality and psychology than anatomy)

                              <P> Ok you have a phimotic ring (this is what caused the paraphimosis) at your stage Id really forget experimenting with creams, you need an operation, - I dont know if you also have a frenulum breve (breve = short) - if you have one, a normal surgeon will almost certainly recommend full circumcision. ... Please look at "<A HREF="../../partial_circumcision.html#start">partial circumcision</A>"

                              <P>S and myself  had  a very long exchange about various practical and other considerations - below are some extracts ...</P>

                              Hi Robin
                              <P> Thanks for your reply.
                              <P> Last week I went to see a specialist and he diagnosed me as congenital Phimosis.<BR>
                                He said that he believes circumcision is the best solution. I didnt even mention partial circumcision . 
                              <P> The specialist / surgeon struck me (thank God) as capable and decent. He<BR>
                                told me something that I already knew - that the chances of contracting<BR>
                                cancer in this 'area' is higher among those with 'extended' foreskins. Its<BR>
                                probably a tried and tested way to persuade those reluctant to op but he<BR>
                                said that I should look at it as a health issue. I asked him whether this<BR>

                                appears to be pretty dead anyway.

                              <P> Im afraid to be in a sexual situation<BR>

                                logical and easy to understand.

                                it? I suppose when I've started asking questions<BR>
                                such as these I have to wonder if its possible<BR>
                                that an op will make sex with my girlfriend /<BR>
                                future girlfriends even less likely"

                                see and feel your head spinning. But - IT IS absolutely <BR>
                                crazy and YOU are NOT - you are responding fully as a<BR>

                              completely enable me to feel normal?"
                              <P> I heard this a hundred times ... I think our great<BR>
                              grand fathers had to give up and accept it ... I<BR>
                              think thats one reason why they were so repressed<BR>

                              a bit out infront - and then starts considering going <BR>
                              to a psychologist to help with the anxiety.

Is there a study or has anybody thought of the connection between sexual deviancy or possibly sex crimes and the types of conditions that we are talking about?

                                Hello Robin
                              <P> It all happened quite quickly after the professor was out of the country or clinic for weeks I thought that I had to strike whilst the iron was hot. I asked him about a part circ and he said it was possible. He didnt pull a face or anything, better still it looked like the op had been performed before at the clinic.
                              <P> So I set it up. Was petrified to be honest. The op took 40 minutes and was painful despite the fact they kept re-injecting me. To call the whole area sensitive would be an understatement. I dont think they were used to the reaction I had, my legs shaking and seriously sweating and the occasional uncontrolable laugh bourne through the tickling feeling on my glans.

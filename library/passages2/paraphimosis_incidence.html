        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                            </B>
                            
                            <P> from Dr. M. (anon) Clinical Fellow Urology
                            
                            <P> I would like to know the incidence of paraphimosis for my <BR>
                              paper
                            <P> Dr M.
                            <P> Dear Dr M.
                            <P> My statistics for phimosis are collected from every study <BR>
                              since 1920.
                            <P> These show the statistics for phimosis among adolescents <BR>
                              are correctly read at, at least 8% (ie. note the incidence <BR>
                              at 17 years old, does not speak for a whole life, or <BR>
                              secondary phimosis eg. as the skin shrinks in old age, when <BR>
                              nurses in old peoples homes report every man is circumcised <BR>
                              or has phimosis).
                            <P> obviously paraphimotic conditions will reoccur in old age, <BR>
                              though as this is a slow closing process, (rather than a <BR>
                              slow opening process), the mature man though disturbed, is <BR>
                              aware of the narrowing process, can control it and can seek <BR>
                              help. 
                            <P> As the degree of phimosis which causes paraphimosis is <BR>
                              hardly noticable in flaccid examinations, the statistics <BR>
                              have never been collected. However the large majority of <BR>
                              phimotic rings which will stick behind the glans when erect <BR>
                              are self released, resulting only in anxiety for the <BR>
                              youngster; or a belated operation which is not directly <BR>
                              accreditted to a paraphimotic diagnosis. From my research I <BR>
                              would suggest 2% have such experiences.
                            <P> I would suggest that cases involving the accident and <BR>
                              emergency dept. are around 0.3% or one boy in every 300. <BR>
                              (Accurate figures could only be found in isolated <BR>
                              communities eg. Isle of Skye). 
                            <P> This is a terrible initiation often experienced at the <BR>
                              beginning of puberty connected with young boys very first <BR>
                              sexual thoughts.
                            <P> To consider is also that as primary phimosis always <BR>
                              stretches then one can calculate a degree of self resolving <BR>
                              paraphimosis is occurring in ALL cases at some time as <BR>
                              baby, during chilhood, boyhood or adolescence. 
                            <P> Therefore; if one lives long enough, and includes the <BR>
                              paraphimotic conditions which inevitably occur as the <BR>
                              phimotic ring narrows again due to secondary phimosis, this <BR>
                              arrives at the interesting possible statistic of an <BR>
                              incidence of 200%.
                            <P> please keep in contact this forum, as so few doctors seem <BR>
                              to be concerned about such matters. 
                            <P> Cheerio<BR>

                            <P> PS. let me explain something, <BR>
                              Apart from Dr. Frank Volta, and Dr jenny Splieth, <BR>
                              (the only Doctors who allowed me to use their names on my site).<BR>
                              Apart from the 3 doctors I met personally who had painful <BR>
                              puberties and didnt want me to use their names.<BR>
                              <BR>
                              Now comes your request : 
                            <P> I wish to repeat an old contact page message.
                            <P> Address to Members of the Medical Profession
                            <P> The anti and the pro circumcision groups have large numbers <BR>
                              of doctors and professors writing on web sites and <BR>
                              publishing medical reports for both of these opposed <BR>
                              extremist perspectives - At present the anti and pro <BR>
                              circers have the only "official" voice on this subject..... <BR>
                              If you agree that monitoring, education and prevention is <BR>
                              the correct modern approach, please support this site.</TD>

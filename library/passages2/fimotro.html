        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P>>Hi Robin<BR>
  >The greek word you 're refering to is ''fimotro'' and this is the thing we put on someone's mouth so he can't talk or show his mouth (it is mostly used for dogs for example) and metaphorically is used to show the censorship, as he who wears fimotro can't express himself or have an opinion.The similar verb is ''fimono'' and means to prevent someone to speak.<BR>
  >That's all with the greek words<BR>

                              <P>Hi George,                             
                              
                              <P>I received this recently from another Greek guy <BR>
  "the word phimosis (or fimosi as it's pronounced in Greek) is a modern Greek word. It comes from the word fimono which means to gag or to choke or to trap someone's mouth (muzzle) not to speak (fimotro is the word for the muzzle used for dogs for example)."
                              <P> I find this fascinating - censorship - and fimotro can't express himself or have an opinion. - Can fimono be used in Greek to say "shut up!" ?
                              <P>&gt;The verb "fimono" cannot exactly be used for "shut up", just because it is too polite and too formal......it's like trying to say ''shut up'' using "muzzle".
                              
                              <P>---------
                              
                              <P> You then actually dont have a fimotro problem - your problem is the frenulum - Frenulum is a Latin word .. it is used in all latin influenced countries .. as in French where "frein" means frenulum, and also the reins of a horse (and also the brakes on a car).
                              <P> Both phimosis and frenulum have been used for centuries and BOTH are based on horses harnesses - the head gear - (nowadays the muzzle is more common for dogs to stop them biting - in previous times it was more common for horses when feeding) 
                              <P> So, what I would like to know, just out of interest, if you can help or look it up in a dictionary, - What is the Greek word for a horses reins??? - please -thanks<BR>
                                Robin 
                              <P> &gt;Hi Robin<BR>
                                &gt;The greek word for horses reins is ''chalinaria" so it hasn't got the same root

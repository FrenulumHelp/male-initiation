        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                                                            <P> I am an individual human being. I was not asked to be <BR>
                                circumcised. I gave no consent. It just happened. I have no <BR>
                                perspective on what it's like to be un-circumsized. Hence, <BR>
                                in my opinion, a valuable learning tool has been taken from <BR>
                                me. Those who have foreskin left to their discretion may <BR>
                                find out what it's like to be without it if they want. <BR>
                                Those who have no foreskin because it was removed from them <BR>
                                without their consent will NEVER know what foreskin is <BR>
                                like. I see a problem. Especially because I believe in human<BR>
                                rights. I didn't say human equality, as it pertains to <BR>
                                chaotic chances of mishap occuring. I said human RIGHTS.
                              <P> I have verbally debated my opinion with a dear friend of <BR>
                                mine who HAS foreskin, without any anger entering into the <BR>
                                discussion. As CHANCE would have it, he was lucky in that <BR>
                                he wasn't born with a deformity, with regard to his <BR>
                                foreskin. His father is a doctor. He knows how to take care <BR>
                                of his foreskin. (my friend) His parents did their DUTY as <BR>
                                parents and educated him on the matter. He is alive, and <BR>
                                healthy, today and tells everyone he knows he feels sorry <BR>
                                that they never had a go at foreskin. He knows that <BR>
                                sometimes bad things happen.
                              <P> How is this not about rights again? Some people say that <BR>
                                the freedom to make your own decisions is the only freedom <BR>
                                anyone really has in this world. I say even that freedom <BR>
                                has been TAINTED. The only good thing the loss of my <BR>
                                foreskin has done for me is remind me that humanity is a <BR>
                                hypocritical mess.
                              <P> That's my opinion. I don't really even want a reply. Just <BR>
                                though't I'd help in my way.
                              <P> Sincerely,<BR>

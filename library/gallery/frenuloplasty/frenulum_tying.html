        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                <P ALIGN="LEFT"><EM>RS Editors note </EM>: <EM>Tying the frenulum is probably the simplest and safest method of curing frenulum breve. Because it is so simple, it is practical in terms of time and money, the essentials in modern life and health care. Another advantage is for the numerous under 18s who since www are discovering their frenulum breve and feel unable to confront their parents for permission for an operation. This treatment requires no operation. It is easier than stitching a wound. A family doctor reading this page would be able to apply the technique without any fuss. </EM></P>
                <P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>A needle with a thin strong thread is pricked underneath the frenulum. It is tightened with knots as tight as possible. The first night afterwards was somewhat painful but the following days it was hardly noticable. The thread and knot really pinch up the skin tissue and cut through the frenulum (even a substantial frenulum)  after about 7 days. Cutting by means of tying up the frenulum makes a much nicer - later on even invisible - scar. The penis has to be softened in hot water for about 15 minutes three times a day. This assists and eases the healing of the wound. After about a week the thread just falls off. </B>It turned out good in my case, but the result still wasn't exactly as I wanted it to be. The process had to be repeated. There was still a remaining section of frenulum which irritated me because it was still a little bit too tight, and so the remaining small section was given a second tying. After a week or two the result was really marvellous. All the nerves were still working perfectly and the feeling was far better than before. The tight frenulum had disappeared, without even needing to remove any tissue. </P>

                <P ALIGN="LEFT">The first tying up was performed at stripe no. 3. The second tying  (after two weeks when the results of the fist cutting were clear) was situated at no. 2. There's hardly any visible scar. Due to the elongation of the frenulum the scars moved on the shaft of the penis. Formerly stripe no. 1 and no. 4 were connected. The distance between 1 and 4 is the new free space.  It's about 1&frac14 inch. </P>
                <P ALIGN="LEFT"><EM>RS Editors note: compare the  traditional Flywhisk Method used by the Luo of East Africa </EM></P>
                <P ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;In this flywhisk strand method, the operation procedure involved the presence of a thorn known as Kuth Alak Tar and one long strand from a flywhisk called Wino. ... The thorn is first used to pierce through the connective tissue joining the foreskin to the male organ. As the thorn pierces further, blood drips from the mutilated part. The Wino is then passed through the opening made by the thorn, and knotted tightly round the circumference of the tissue. ... &quot;</P>
                <P ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;The knotted strand would slowly cut through the tissue overnight after two days, or more, depending on the individuals.... unmelted animal ghee known as Mor-Dhiang' is applied to the connective tissue as long as it is knotted. The application of this ghee is thought to act as the modern petroleum jelly substitute, to render the connective tissue soft to accelerate the severing process of the knotted flywhisk strand.&quot;</P>

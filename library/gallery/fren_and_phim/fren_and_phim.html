        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                    <P>A 16yr. old writes: <BR>
                      You may remember about a year ago I got in touch saying I think I have Phimosis.&nbsp; Since birth I have not been able to retract my foreskin over the glands of my penis and I was recommended by you to tell my parents or see a doctor.&nbsp; After being embarrassed for a few months I decided to tell my mum who took me to the doctors.&nbsp; After attempting to stretch my foreskin, I still couldn&rsquo;t retract it and so I knew I had to do something.<BR>
                      <BR>
                      After visiting the doctors last year he sent me to a specialist for advice.&nbsp; After speaking to a specialist he offered me 3 solutions: Leave it, circumcision or some partial surgery which leaves the foreskin on but fully retractable.&nbsp; Of course I decided to have the partial one and nearly a year later I finally have my operation date.&nbsp; I am undergoing general aesthetic and hopefully I will be sorted out.&nbsp; I have never had an operation before, and because this is my first and on a weird place, I am very nervous about it.<BR>
                      <BR>
                      I have sent this email to thank you for persuading me to tell someone and visit a doctor.&nbsp; If you want, after the operation I could write you a story about my problem for any teenagers who possibly have the same.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t find the website I used to email you and today I eventually found it!</P>
                    <P>&gt;Yes, I remember the night before my operation I dreamt of a doctor<BR>
                      wielding an axe ... Seen practically this is an incredibly simple<BR>
                      operation - seen emotionally it is sure to bring out all the old<BR>
                    Freudian fears of castration etc ...</P>
                    <P>&gt;What actually interests me is how did you find out you had a problem<BR>
                      and what it was? ... I think you can be happy that you live post<BR>
                      internet ... previously there was no information ... I took till I was<BR>
                      43 till I discovered what I had and how to cure it!</P>
                    <P>I found out from simple diagrams in science etc that they were all the same and I never seen one like mine.  I thought about it and I figured out that just by looking at the 'mechanics' of it, it wouldn&rsquo;t work properly during sex!</P>
                    <P><B>Example 2</B></P>
                  <P>From the pics u will see that I can now pull my foreskin back when flaccid   (something I could not do until the last week or two). If I then have an   erection the skin will remain behind the head and I have to wait until I   loose the erection before I can get my foreskin back up.  I get a 'tight' and slightly sore feeling when I have an erection with my   foreskin back.  There is very little skin movement possible in any direction.    If I have an erection first and then try to pull my foreskin back it will   only go approx. half way down the head before the 'ring' gets too tight to   move any further.</P>

        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                    <P>From what i can gather, I have phimosis, for as long as i can remember I  have not been able to retract my foreskin, for 20 years this was not a problem  becuase I didn't know i should be able to. About a year ago I went to the doctor  about it and we both decided that it was my frenulm, I had a operation to cut  the frenulm which helped a small amount. I can now retract my foreskin fully  when not erect, yet when erect, I cannot. Depending on how erect my penis is, I  can retract the foreskin almost fully when I am just over semi erect, however i  would not want to. The  main problem is that when fully erect, I can uncomfortably retract the foreskin  over the head of my penis, but no further, if I continually try I start to loose  my erection and then it starts to retract as I said before. </P>

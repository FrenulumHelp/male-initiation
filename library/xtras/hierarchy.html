                              <P>I was enjoying a nice chat with a lovely lady, when that old question 
                                came up about those power crazy prehistoric men, who took over the 
                                power, organised the hierarchy and subjugated the women ... (sigh) 
                                ... Then I had a brain wave ...</P>
                              <P>When gathering, it is obvious what needs to be done, it is an occupation 
                                which needs little organisation, and no hierarchy in order to organise 
                                it. Thus, the women didn't develop a strong organisations hierarchy.</P>
                              <P>The men, in order to hunt larger animals, needed to plan group coordination. 
                                I imagine they particularly needed to co-ordinate the timing of any 
                                attack, and thus, to have a leader who would decide when the moment 
                                was right, and to signalise this. In this way an organisations hierarchy 
                                was established and became a confirmed form.</P>
                              <P>Such an organisations system naturally took over all forms of planning. 
                                This was not because men were power crazy manipulators, rather they 
                                developed the dubious talent of organising, as a response to their 
                                environmental position.</P>
                              <P>The girl I was talking to suggested that the Iroqua N.American Indians 
                                were a matriarchy, and surprisingly enough were also a tribe who sustained 
                                themselves from farming and gathering, rather than hunting</P>
                              <P>... The question is, have I merely bamboozled one woman, or could 
                                this be a good line for other men to bear in mind?</P>

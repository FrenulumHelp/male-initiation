        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P>It is clear that the majority of the medical profession do not recognise 
                                any connection between these genital conditions and the sexuality. 
                                ... Initially, most doctors treated me as if I was under a delusion, 
                                this was mutual, I diagnosed that the doctors showed symptoms of a 
                                taboo.</P>
                              <P> One suggested very tactfully that if I had a sexual problem, I did not need any operation on the foreskin but 
                                should seek &quot;professional help&quot; (ie. from prostitutes), I could add 
                                that in my opinion this was one of the most thoughtful comments 
                                which I received (simply because he acknowledged what I said about 
                                a sexual problem!).</P>
                              <P>Both diagnosing surgeons failed to see the relative phimotic ring, 
                                I saw no reason to point it out and then have to persuade them against 
                                a circumcision - first I wanted the &quot;tight band&quot; removing 
                                - I had no idea at that time how the &quot;tight ring&quot; would influence 
                                my erection . and it was pretty obvious they hadnt either. ... I have had to point 
                                it out to several urologists - it obviously 
                                takes a trained eye to recognise this pale ring </P>
                              <P> It seems the practical doctors have only rarely received feedback 
                                from individual men on these problems. One urologist suggested that 
                                he was being tactful by not asking the men about possible sexual 
                                problems to do with their condition <A HREF="refs.html#ref8">(8)</A>. 
                                It is not the practical doctors job to understand such matters. 
                                Urologists and surgeons are trained to be aware of the practicalities: 
                                a man experiences pain difficulty or tension, and this requires 
                                an extremely small routine job, - the most commonly performed in 
                                the world - which in comparison to e.g. heart ops, is truly are 
                                not worth worrying about. </P>
                              <P>Surgeons and urologists operate for cosmetic, so-called &quot;free 
                                choice&quot; or hygienic reasons and have no idea of any sexual effects 
                                during erection. </P>
                              <P>It is not the surgeons job to understand sexual behaviour and psychological 
                                research has concentrated on parental and environmental phenomenon.</P>
                              <P><B>Psychologists</B><BR>
                                Freud was a taboo breaker and thus he has my full respect; but unfortunately 
                                he confirmed the taboos about circumcision (see <A HREF="refs.html#ref8">Oedipus 
                                  complex</A>). Today, our cultural wisdom unquestioningly interprets 
                                adult sexual inhibitions in terms of problems with upbringing and 
                                environment.</P>
                              <P>Years previously I had consulted psychologists with the primary 
                                symptom of quelling my erection (to make it manageable for masturbation 
                                and when waking in the middle of the night). This should have been 
                                an obvious symptom of a difficult foreskin, for anyone who has studied the subject of problems 
                                in male sexuality. I never thought of consulting a surgeon or urologist 
                                about these disturbances and neither did the psychologists, 
                                such ideas simply do not belong to our cultures accepted thinking patterns. 
                              <P>Recently I consulted psychologists again, imagining they would be 
                                interested in the true cause of my disturbances. It is clear that psychologists 
                                have never researched and have no training or awareness of the effects 
                                of genital pain and difficulty from foreskin conditions. 
                              <P>Even those practicing psychologists who specialise in giving sexual 
                                advice, receive no training or education on foreskin conditions. I 
                                consulted 3 specialists in this field. The idea that foreskin conditions lead to sexual difficulties is categorically rejected. </P>

                              <P>This taboo is not simply all caused by a medical oversight on 
                                behalf of the experts - this is a cultural taboo. The taboo exists 
                                at street level.</P>         </TD></TR></TABLE></TD>

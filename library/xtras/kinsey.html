        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                                  <FONT SIZE="4">Extract From &quot;The Kinsey Institute New Report on 
Sex&quot;</FONT></FONT>
                              <P>The Kinsey report, "Sexual Behavior in the Human Male", makes 
                                no mention of circumcision. The Kinsey Institute New Report on Sex, 
                                says that phimosis and paraphimosis are infections <A HREF="refs.html#ref17">(17)</A>. 
                              <P><B>On page 126 a woman asks for advice;</B><BR>
  &quot;I hope you can give me an answer to a question which has puzzled 
                                me throughout my 27-year-marriage. My husband was never circumcised. 
                                Can this affect intercourse?<BR>
  &quot;The doctor who gave me a premarital examination said that the 
                                penis should come in direct contact with the clitoris during coitus, 
                                but this does not occur in our case, since the generous foreskin covers 
                                the vagina like a turtle neck.&quot;</P>
                              <P>They have obviously little understanding of the condition and fail 
                                to recognise "the generous foreskin covers the vagina like a turtle 
                                neck" as a common symptom of phimosis. They answer:<BR>
  &quot;You have been misled. Once the penis is inside the vagina it 
                                rarely contacts the clitoris which is near the top of the vulva. Moreover, 
                                during arousal a woman's clitoris is often covered as her labia swell.&quot;</P>

                              <P>On 1st June 96 I wrote to the Kinsey Institute:<BR>
  &quot;Please compare your advice on pages 126-127 of the Kinsey New 
                                Report to my page 9 (in the accompanying booklet) : are you sure you 
                                have interpreted the &quot;foreskin . . . like a turtle neck&quot; 
                                correctly? Also please consider changing the comments which refer to 
                                phimosis and paraphimosis as infections, (on page 339 and in the index).&quot;</P>
                              <P>I wrote four times, then received a polite reply thanking me for 
                                the booklet &quot;From Innocence to Ignorance&quot;, however, there 
                                was no response to my comments.</P></TD>

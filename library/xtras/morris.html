        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P>Previously I held Desmond Morris in great respect. His anthropological 
                                views always appeared balanced and intelligent. However in the best 
                                sellers Bodywatching and especially in Babywatching we can review an 
                                amazingly illogical argument about circumcision. While we may sympathise 
                                with his opinion, we must be amazed at his illogical thinking. </P>
                              <P>Morris offers no discussion of phimosis, but in the best seller Bodywatching: he writes "In fact circumcision 
                                has no medical advantages, ..." </P>
                              <P>His opinions over circumcision reach their high point in Babywatching. 
                                Whereas the encyclopedias say that they do not know the origins of 
                                traditional routine male circumcision, Morris claims "It started as 
                                an ancient Egyptian custom ... It seems to have its origin in snake 
                                worship" He describes the thought association between snakes and 
                                  foreskins and then in developing his subject "Apart from the original 
                                  superstitious reasons".... He writes that "The ritual mutilation 
                                    spread and spread"<I> -- As Hastings pointed out in 1936, this custom did not spread, this is "proved 
                                    beyond all doubt by the existence of circumcision in America and Australia 
                                    where no sane person would allege African influence." </I></P>
                              <P>His method of proving that "There is not a single valid argument 
                                in favour of mutilating baby boys ... "is to present a list of 
                                laughable reasons for Circumcision (with no mention of phimosis and no references!) then subsequently he has no difficulty in showing how irrational each 
                                idea is</P>
                              <P>"(1) It limits intercourse. ... (3) It makes men holy because the 
                                prophet Mohammed was born without a foreskin. (4) It is unclean to 
                                have a foreskin. (5) It prevents masturbation. (6) It provides an offering 
                                to the gods in the form of a symbol of male virility. (7) It removes 
                                a physical defect fro the male body. (8) The Devil hides beneath the 
                                foreskin, and therefore to remove this skin is to remove his hiding 
                                place and expose him. (9) It caused many medical conditions such as 
                                hysteria, epilepsy and nocturnal incontinence. (10) It caused mental 
                                illness. ... (12) Its removal makes a boy grow up to 'feel regular'."</P>
                              <P>As Morris freely admits: "All these reasons are complete nonsense." This is correct . Morris says nothing of any of the significant ideas of initiation, 
                                fertility, sacrifice. </P>
                              <P>Nos. (2) and (11) are the only vaguely pertinent ideas</P>
                              <P>"(2) It provides a badge of tribal or social allegiance." His answer 
                                to this is "It no longer provides a mark of allegiance because 
                                it has been carried out on sch a wide range of males from so many cultures 
                                and societies in different parts of the world." <EM>This  is simply untrue ... as shown by 
                                the Muslims and Jews where circumcision is still a mark of allegiance.</EM></P>
                              <P>"(11) It caused cancer of the penis in males and cancer of the cervix 
                                in their wives." ... he answers without any proof 
                                or references "Claims that it causes cancer have now been revealed 
                                as completely false." <EM>I have not researched the area in depth, however a brief look 
                                at the MEDLINE studies on penis cancer show that all studies suggest a connection between phimosis 
                                and cancer </EM></P>
                              <P>The one thing Morris does is to demonstrate 
                                vividly the irrational thinking which surrounds this subject. </P>

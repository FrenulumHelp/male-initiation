                                of Routine Male Circumcision </FONT></B> </P>
                            <P> The anthropological discussion so far, on congenital abnormalities <BR />
                              of the penis, as a cause for the ancient ritual of circumcision, <BR />
                              involves only the rare cases of phimosis which hinder procreation. </P>
                            <P> When we study Beauge M.D,'s statistics : (almost 10% for phimosis) <BR />
                              and reports on masturbation, <BR />
  <A HREF="http://www.cirp.org/CIRP/library/treatment/phimosis/beauge/">http://www.cirp.org/CIRP/library/treatment/phimosis/beauge/</A> <BR />
                              we realise that this argument is null and void. </P>
                            <P> It is further disproven by Dr. Med. Schoeberlein (1) who studied <BR />
                              3,000 young men and discovered 8.8% had a phimosis.<BR />
  <A HREF="../medicus/schoeberlein.html#start">http://www.male-initiation.net/library/medicus/schoeberlein.html</A></P>
                            <P> Neither of these statistics include the frenulum breve, <BR />
                              infections, or a number of other foreskin complaints <BR />
                              which may also be resolved by circumcision. </P>
                            <P> A re-evaluation of these congenital<BR />
                              phenomena is available under<BR />
  <A HREF="../../welcome.html#start">http://www.male-initiation.net/welcome.html</A></P>
                            <P> The significance of this information is discussed under<BR />
                              <A HREF="../../anthropology.html#start">http://www.male-initiation.net/anthropolgy.html</A> </P>
                            <P> Probably the simplest abstract I could give is that I find it <BR />
                              helpful to consider the question &quot;What is the origin of <BR />
                              the practice?&quot; in three parts </P>
                            <P> 1) Why was the original operation performed? <BR />
                              2) Why was the measure introduced? <BR />
                              3) Why did the practice continue and sometimes spread? </P>
                            <P> My main interest is<BR />
                              no. 2) Why was this introduced as a general measure? </P>
                            <P>The human mind in the late Stone Age, was certainly very <BR />
                              different to ours, however their bodies were similar. The <BR />
                              possibility is that men in those days also had some sort <BR />
                              of unpleasant subjective experience with these congenital <BR />
                              conditions. Such men could have had the personal conviction <BR />
                              (or deluded fanaticism), to introduce this measure, in order <BR />
                              to prevent similar experiences happening to any other <BR />
                              member of their family.</P>

A RE-INTERPRETATION of OSTER
<P>
Statistics and the self resolving possibilities of phimosis</B>
<P>
Dr. Med. Werner Schoeberlein says that "in medical 
examinations of 3,000 young men, mostly of an age between 
18 and 22 years. . . . A phimosis was found in 8.8%." (1)
<P>
Beauge M.D. reports "nearly 10%" of young men between 
the ages of "18 to 22" had phimosis. He was "in charge for 
over ten years of the routine examination of college freshmen" 
he recommended "treatment for 30 to 40 boys annually". He 
says he had "observed several hundred cases", l feel we 
may conservatively calculate that his study involved 
at least 4,000 men.(2)
<P>
If phimosis (according to Oster) is self resolving, why do 
Beauge and Schoeberlein report such high figures?
<P>
Either, 1) Coupled with Oster's yearly careful attempts at 
retraction, he says "the boys received regular instruction 
about preputial hygiene". This instruction started previous 
to puberty, and it may have helped to relieve phimosis to 
some extent, Or, 2) boys with sexual inhibitions stay away 
from school when they know their penis will be examined, . . . 
. . or 3) he was wrong.
<P>
I feel we can discount the idea that the relationship foreskin 
to glans develops eratically around the age of 16-18, and the 
proximity in Europe suggests there is no important dietary 
difference or any basic anatomical difference (as there is 
between say the Chinese, and Europeans).
<P>
Have you any other suggestions? what other 
possibilities are there?
<P>
------------------------------
<P>
Beauge reports that instruction over normal methods of 
masturbation cured many of his patients. This would correlate 
with Oster's regular instruction, with attention to the retraction 
of the foreskin. Surely if Beauge was correct, the sooner such a 
process could begin with a young boy, the more possibility it 
would have of working.
<P>
I suspect that a phimose or frenulum breve which had been 
stretched in youth would need a more permanent cure in later 
years, particularly in old age as the preputial skin tightens again. 
This would at least give an individual time to think.
<P>
Anyone want to comment? - or shall we presume this 
re - interpretation is correct?

Saitmacher studied only 229 boys (ages 14-19) and found 8.7%
where "the foreskin could be retracted only with difficulty
or with pain"

Apart from the above four studies, are there any others which 
review the statistics??

<P> -------------------------------------------------------------------- 
<P>
<B>EXTRA CONFUSION from OSTER </B>
<P> Oster never adds his figures for phimosis and tight prepuce together, 
 this would make 2.4% and not 1% in the 16-17 yr.old age group. Mathematics 
 can't have been Oster's strong point. 
<P> His closing words are "1086 boys observed in 1964-65" led to "1052 
 observations" 
<P>Apart from French and German studies), every medical study which 
 mentions statistics, quote Oster's figures, . . . or other sources 
 which in turn quote Oster. (e.g. see the anti-circ. library :"CIRP"), 
<P>
(The only exception is a reference to Dr. Spock. While 
confirming Oster's ideas - Spock gives no references, 
need we ask where his ideas comes from?) -
(This is all no reflection on CIRP, it is a 
reflection on medical information).
<P>
------------------------------
<P>
Iatrogenic cases?
<P>
Oster suggests that some cases of phimosis may be caused by 
the doctor's interferance in the normal and natural growth 
process, he says "raising the possibility that the phimosis 
in these cases may have been iatrogenic."
<P>
In reports from parents about operations before and at 
puberty, they always say no-one checked, and no-one told 
them how to check, just all at once their child had either 
paraphimose or, an infection and a phimose. 
<P> One medical report EX-CIRP/library, from Kikiros CS, Beasley SW, 
 Woodward AA disagrees with Oster's "possibility" that early attempts 
 at retraction may cause phimosis. 
<P> ------------------------------ 
<P>
<B>EXTRA rather boring POINTS</B>
<P>
The frequency of phimosis can not be established by 
adding up the medical diagnose on the circumcision 
operation's list. (Or from any individual doctor's 
opinion or guess). <BR>
1) Most men do not openly complain about sexual problems, 
and in order to avoid embarrassment,would be happy with 
a diagnosis of "free choice". <BR>
2) A congenital primary phimosis can often lead to 
infections, and be cured for reasons of this secondary 
symptom. The reason such cases go to the doctor is because 
of the infection. At this stage there appears to be no way 
of establishing if the phimose is cause or effect of the
infection. The infection is the most serious problem
and the obvious diagnosis.<BR>
3) In addition paraphimose is not diagnosed 
as a phimosis.<BR>
<P>
Around a third of the cases I have spoken with, 
had problems with the frenulum breve, (for which 
there are no statistics.),and some of the others 
still had adhesions at puberty, these cases could 
not have been caused by doctors tampering. If the 
reports I heard were in actual fact, reports of 
secondary phimoses which had developed previous 
to puberty, then this indicates that children 
must be checked at the age of 8 or 9 years old, 
instead of 3 or 4yrs. old.
<P>
I believe the total figure is at least 10% simply because of the men I talked with. 
If there were only 1% then surely I wouldn't
have heard of so many cases among the hundred or so people I asked.
<P> As I say in the essay "If the statistics were only 1%, this would 
 be too many". I believe, if parents were aware of a 1% chance, they 
 would want to check their children.I have never seen any source references 
 for this 1% figure, (or to which country such statistics refer) apart 
 from Oster.

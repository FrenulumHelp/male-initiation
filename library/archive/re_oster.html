        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              A RE-INTERPRETATION of OSTER
                            <P ALIGN="LEFT"><B> Statistics and the self resolving possibilities of phimosis</B>
                                           <P ALIGN="LEFT"> Dr. Med. Werner Schoeberlein says that "in medical 
                                             examinations of 3,000 young men, mostly of an age between 
                                             18 and 22 years. . . . A phimosis was found in 8.8%." (1)
                                           <P ALIGN="LEFT"> Beauge M.D. reports "nearly 10%" of young men between 
                                             the ages of "18 to 22" had phimosis. He was "in charge for 
                                             over ten years of the routine examination of college freshmen" 
                                             he recommended "treatment for 30 to 40 boys annually". He 
                                             says he had "observed several hundred cases", l feel we 
                                             may conservatively calculate that his study involved 
                                             at least 4,000 men.(2)
                                           <P ALIGN="LEFT"> If phimosis (according to Oster) is self resolving, why do 
                                             Beauge and Schoeberlein report such high figures?
                                           <P ALIGN="LEFT"> Either, 1) Coupled with Oster's yearly careful attempts at 
                                             retraction, he says "the boys received regular instruction 
                                             about preputial hygiene". This instruction started previous 
                                             to puberty, and it may have helped to relieve phimosis to 
                                             some extent, Or, 2) boys with sexual inhibitions stay away 
                                             from school when they know their penis will be examined, . . . 
                                             . . or 3) he was wrong.
                                           <P ALIGN="LEFT"> I feel we can discount the idea that the relationship foreskin 
                                             to glans develops eratically around the age of 16-18, and the 
                                             proximity in Europe suggests there is no important dietary 
                                             difference or any basic anatomical difference (as there is 
                                             between say the Chinese, and Europeans).
                                           <P ALIGN="LEFT"> Have you any other suggestions? what other 
                                             possibilities are there?
                                           <P ALIGN="LEFT"> ------------------------------
                                           <P ALIGN="LEFT"> Beauge reports that instruction over normal methods of 
                                             masturbation cured many of his patients. This would correlate 
                                             with Oster's regular instruction, with attention to the retraction 
                                             of the foreskin. Surely if Beauge was correct, the sooner such a 
                                             process could begin with a young boy, the more possibility it 
                                             would have of working.
                                           <P ALIGN="LEFT"> I suspect that a phimose or frenulum breve which had been 
                                             stretched in youth would need a more permanent cure in later 
                                             years, particularly in old age as the preputial skin tightens again. 
                                             This would at least give an individual time to think.
                                           <P ALIGN="LEFT"> Anyone want to comment? - or shall we presume this 
                                             re - interpretation is correct?

        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                                My Mum would cry her eyes out, if she thought, she'd done something<BR>
                                wrong in my upbringing, but it wasn't her fault, she acted on the <BR>
                                best medical advice, which is still being given : <BR>
  "[American Academy of Pediatrics]: "Care of the uncircumcised boy <BR>
                                is quite easy. "Leave it alone" is
                                good
                                advice."<BR>
  <BR>
                                Didn't your mother also act on the best medical advice at the time? :<BR>
  "cut it off"...Maybe
                                your Mum did other things to you which make you<BR>
                                angry with her, but RIC is surely a cultural ignorance, (call it
                                abuse<BR>
                                if you want) not your Mum's fault. <BR>
  <BR>
                                I feel our experiences are poles apart, and yet they were
                                both caused by<BR>
                                the same cultural ignorance. AND STILL this ignorance continues, <BR>
                                leave it alone, <BR>
                                or
                                cut it off,<BR>
                                ... does it not seem ridiculous to you that people adopt these<BR>
                                fanatical extremes, instead of
                                simply

                                before puberty and before any emergency decision is<BR>

When you refer to the diseased foreskin, are you not referring to the<BR>
ignored foreskin, the one's which parents are
told to leave alone, and<BR>
so the adhesions stick and lots of ugly skin malformations can establish<BR>
themselves,
and then the urine and smegma collects and UGH.<BR>
<BR>
Wouldn't you agree - its the same as anything else, if
you
don't ignore<BR>
it, it may turn into something beautiful... .<BR>

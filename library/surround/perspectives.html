        <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Psychological research has concentrated on parental 
          and environmental phenomenon, and the urological disciplines do not 
          include sexual behaviour. Scientific research has overlooked this area 
          of human sexuality. </FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P></TD>

                              <P><BR>
                                Being curious as to why such diversity of very strong opinion exists 
                                on circumcision, I thought a while and would like to propose the following 
                                theories.</P>
                              <P>I would like to consider the different fates of the foreskin in 
                                five rough categories:</P>
                              <UL>
                                <P>1. Free of problems, circumcised routinely in childhood,<BR>
                                  2. Free of problems, uncircumcised,<BR>
                                  3. Circumcised routinely and developed problems from the operation,<BR>
                                  4. Uncircumcised with conscious problems,<BR>
                                  5. Uncircumcised with problems and unaware of these. 
                              </UL>
                              <P>_____1. 2. In the vast majority of cases the circumcised or uncircumcised 
                                man, who is free of problems, is happy as he is.</P>
                              <P>It is obvious that the essential physical masculine part of an uncircumcised 
                                and a circumcised man is different. However any difference in potential 
                                for manhood is insignificant, anatomically and psychologically, in 
                                comparison to a man who has any sort of anatomical restriction.</P>
                              <P>_____3. The man who was routinely circumcised in childhood, who 
                                has experienced problems (usually from skin bridges), can often feel 
                                quite angry about this early interference. The apparent senselessness 
                                of this routine operation in a rational and free thinking culture, 
                                can be felt as a breach of modern civil liberties.</P>
                              <P>In these cases it would be understandable to develop an undue feeling 
                                of value for the lost or 'stolen' foreskin. The development and recognition 
                                of <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/HotSprings/8890/index#restoration"
TARGET="_blank">restoration programs</A> and operations may help in 
                                some cases, however the alleviative which is most often called for 
                                is to abolish routine infant circumcision.</P>
                              <P>_____4. Boys who are consciously aware of pain or difficulty develop 
                                a strong awareness of the glans other can show and they cannot and 
                                are often quite capable of deciding for themselves at puberty that 
                                circumcision is needed. It is clear that during puberty, some youths 
                                build up painful memories and even resentment about their problem foreskins. 
                                It appears to be often such men who support ideas of routine circumcision. </P>
                              <P>If a boy wants a <A HREF="../../circumcision/haircut.html#start">circumcision</A> for any reasons, then he should most certainly be given this.</P>
                              <P>_____ 5. Those men who were not aware of their problem, with conditions 
                                where the foreskin has often covered the glans entirely, have sometimes 
                                only ever seen their foreskin and never knew it could retract . The 
                                nature of such problems often leads to an excessive attachment to the 
                                foreskin. This can lead to traumatic feelings among some adults when 
                                confronted with circumcision.</P>
                              <P>This situation should be respected and unless specifically requested, <A
HREF="../../phimosis_treatment.html#stretch">stretching</A> or <A
HREF="../../phimosis_treatment.html#minimal">minimal surgery</A> should 
                                be considered, (with the obvious possibility of removing more at a 
                                later date if this become desirable).                              </P>

        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P></TD>

                              <P>By its emphasis on a parental and environmental understanding 
                                of sexuality, psychological theory and practice inadvertantly reinforce 
                                the feelings of shame and social non-acceptance even rejection for 
                                the sufferer of foreskin conditions. 
                              <P>The science of psychology shoulders great responsibility in the 
                                understanding of sexuality and shows great compassion for men`s 
                                doubts and worries about their sexual and self images, their castration 
                                fears etc., However the actual reality of a non-functional erection 
                                and its influences are ignored. 
                              <P>The accepted clich&eacute; - that one`s equipment is always "normal" 
                                or that the man`s penis size shape or any other difference is irrelevant 
                                to his being a man - has significant consequences for individuals 
                                with anatomical problems. As every youth understands that penis 
                                size and bends etc. <I>should not</I> affect his sexuality, the 
                                isolated individual with actual (or imagined) physical problems 
                                is under immense social pressure to forget or repress these embarrassing 
                                socially unacceptable and even laughable ideas; instead of being 
                                able to freely discuss the subject andreceive some specific treatment 
                                (or be reassured). His guilt and shame magnify and compound his 
                                situation. 
                              <P>Against the background of his many years training, the psychologist 
                                at present when confronted with "foreskin problems" will deduce 
                                that a psychological disturbance must lie at root, thus causing 
                                the anatomical condition to become a problem in the first place. 
                                It is necessary to correct this situation. 
                              <P><B>In contrast to worries about penis size and shape, foreskin 
                                conditions are actually and manifestly painful or difficult during 
                                sexual activity and this has a significant effect on the sexual 
                                possibilities and behavioural development. </B>
                              <P>Against a background of repressed or accomodated anatomical genital 
                                pain or difficulty there will be inevitable psychological repercussions 
                                - it would be rather remarkable if this were not the case. And as 
                                the painful erection is only one factor supporting and combined 
                                with all the other factors in a personality, the consequent behavioural 
                                and psychological patterns will inevitably be related to childhood 
                                problems. But among these childhood problems it is important to 
                                recognise that the anatomical predisposition to pain or difficulty 
                                was often present since birth and the influence of an uncomfortable 
                                and avoided erection is a fundamental influence in the psycho-sexual 
                                development of an individual. 
                              <P><B>This overlooked phenomenon could excite considerable interest 
                                among psychologists.</B>
                              <P><B>Therapists should be aware that even if environmental problems 
                                appear to predominate, a short conversation to confirm the patient 
                                is aware of foreskin retraction will eliminate the possibility of 
                                this extra hidden complication.</B>
                              <P><B>WABREK - The Therapists Responsibility</B> <BR>
Students of sexual psychology are sometimes taught that if a man 
   reports pain during sex then they should send him to a Urologist <A HREF="../xtras/refs.html#ref93">(93)</A>, <A HREF="../medicus/wabrek.html#start">Wabrek</A> made this mistake before concluding: "During the physical examination, 
   most males don't get an erection, so it is difficult to find out 
   if the foreskin will retract over the erect glans; therefore, this 
   must be elicitated by history." 
  
                              <P> Wabrek points out the responsibility of the sexual therapist 
                                to discuss this uncomfortable subject with the patient and not simply 
                                send the patient away to the Urologist. Diagnosis is sometimes only 
                                possible during erection OR through dialogue.
                              <P>Urologists do not give an erection stimulant and then test the 
                                free movement of the foreskin - (at speed!) - Urologists diagnose 
                                foreskin conditions in the flaccid state. They receive no training 
                                on the point which <A HREF="../medicus/wabrek.html#start">Wabrek</A> establishes "The teaching point is that just because the foreskin 
                                slides over the flaccid penis does not mean it is going to slide 
                                over the erect penis." 
                                                          <P><B>How To Ask</B><BR>
                                                            To ascertain if a foreskin condition could be causing problems the 
                                                            therapist may first tentatively ask if the patient is circumcised 
                                                            - this may eliminate the need for further questions or pave the 
                                                            way for more detailed questioning: To ask if retraction take place 
                                                            automatically during erection may be a tactful and informative step; 
                                                            however after this it will be necessary to use the simplest and 
                                                            most accurate method of enquiring directly - <B>if it is enjoyable 
                                                              to move the foreskin, alternately covering and uncovering the glans. </B>
                              <P>It is not enough to ask if the glans shows during masturbation, 
                                men who expose only the tip of the glans will often believe that 
                                this is sufficient, others will habitually hold the foreskin retracted 
                                to avoid the ring scraping over the glans. If there is a foreskin 
                                then this must be able to move freely not being held forward or 
                                backward in any way. <BR>
     <BR>
     <B>To ascertain the exact nature of the problem, a brief discussion 
       about the sexual effects gives a far more accurate diagnosis than 
       flaccid examination. </B>

        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P>When the foreskin is fastened, restrained or harnessed, its movement 
                                relative to the glans is inhibited. <B>The Oxford dictionary says an 
                                  inhibition is a "restraint on the direct expression of an instinct."</B> What could be a more direct inhibition of the male sexual instinct, 
                                than on the phallus itself . To inhibit: hinder, restrain [Latin - <I>hibit</I> - hinder] - Foreskin conditions consitute an anatomical 
                                inhibition </P>
                              <P>Anyone with any sort of inhibition does not experiment as freely 
                                in that area. With a boy whose phallus is inhibited this is also true. 
                                With this anatomical inhibition, he does not experiment, he does not 
                                discover, he does not know, and he is simply not as aware of his phallus, 
                                as he would be potentially, (or not as aware of it in the same way 
                                as he would be potentially) if he had no inhibition. 
                              <P>If he's not as aware of, he does not admire, or have as much interest 
                                in his phallus (as he would have potentially ... if he had no inhibition). 
                              <P>When the physical essence of his maleness, what defines him as a 
                                man, is inhibited, the individual cannot real-ise what a man can be 
                                and do anatomically. If a boy with these conditions does identify with 
                                his phallus, any visual or tactile recognition of his sexual identity 
                                would be at most one dimensional, one sided and limited. With the foreskin 
                                retracted the phallus is more interesting simply because of the great 
                                diversity of shape and skin types. In addition the possibility of being 
                                able to move the foreskin to cover and uncover the glans is considerable, 
                                this could be compared to the difference between a snap shot and a 
                                movie. 
                              <P>This is the physical inhibition of an instinct. These conditions 
                                are implicitly sexually inhibiting, and sex is a social activity, thus 
                                they constitute social inhibitions. 
                              <P><B>AN ILLUSION</B><BR>
                                The Oxford dictionary says an illusion is a "False impression or 
                                belief . . state of being deceived by appearances". Though a sense 
                                of belief in himself as man - it would essentialy be founded on the 
                                appearance of the foreskin being held forward, it would be correct 
                                to understand this as based on an illusion. - (ie. not a delusion: 
                                false impression or belief, as a symptom or form of mental disorder.) 
                              <P>His perception of his own manhood, and his self image as a man. 
                                . any recognition of or belief he establishes in his sexual identity, 
                                would be based on a misinterpretation of his full potential, it would 
                                be based on the misconception that the foreskin is designed to remain 
                                forward or cause difficulty, tension or pain
                              <P>Though a sense of belief in his maleness may develop it can never 
                                be founded on facts, it would be based on an illusion 
                              <P>His perception of his own manhood, his self image as a man and any 
                                belief he establishes in his sexual identity would be based on the 
                                misconception that the foreskin is designed to remain forward or cause 
                                difficulty tension or pain. This is a misinterpretation of his potential 
                                as male, an illusion. 
                              <P>This is the physical inhibition of an instinct. These conditions 
                                are implicitly sexually inhibiting, and sex is a social activity. They 
                                inhibit the potential development and the full participation in life 
                                as a man. 
                              <P>I can already hear the voices saying "but that`s not all it takes 
                                to be a man" and yes I agree - and Im only describing one aspect of 
                                the human male.

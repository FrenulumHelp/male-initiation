        <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Psychological research has concentrated on parental 
          and environmental phenomenon, and the urological disciplines do not 
          include sexual behaviour. Scientific research has overlooked this area 
          of human sexuality. </FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P></TD>

                              <P>Over the years I've met a lot of different ways of rejecting the realities of foreskin 
                                conditions.</P>
                              <P>Recently (1997) an idea I've heard often from modern healers and practioners of alternative medicine, is that my 
                                experience with foreskin conditions is all a sort of spiritual problem which is ultimately 
                                my own choice. I feel this idea may have a place in some forms of therapy when an individual wont 
                                take responsibility for his life etc.... but consider the concept of 
                                karma for a moment, surely some things are choices, some are consequences. - We dont just always choose, this is a ridiculous idea, we are not God, we may strive to be free but we are bound in this wheel of consequences. </P>
                              <P>In a practical sense to follow your idea to conclusions; children choose 
                                lots of other problems: diphtheria, tonsillitis, being beaten by their 
                                Dad, even lack of nourishment or an early death  ... But, all these other problems 
                              are checked for and/or prevented when possible. </P>
                              <P>I believe t his new "choice" idea is merely a new word for "free will"; Western 
                                philosophers have been stumbling over the question of &quot;free will 
                                or fate&quot; for centuries. I believe this question is predetermined 
                                by our speech patterns. Our grammar perpetually confirms the impression 
                                of either an I that does, or an I which is done to,.. . either subject 
                                or object .... our understanding is moulded by these parameters, ... but 
                                things would happen anyway, without any I choosing them to happen .... </P>
                              <P>It COULD be your own choice is maybe a better way 
                                to think and be able to stimulate creative thought.                              </P></TD>

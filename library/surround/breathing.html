                                It often takes a long time for anyone and
                                everyone to discover things, and this happens often with lots of people in lots of different walks of life, even when
                                there is adequate available information. </P>
                              <P>I myself felt amazed that I hadn`t discovered my curious condition 
                                earlier - I felt like a joke figure. I was frequently asked: "Why did 
                                it take you so long to discover?" I was stumped, it was so obvious 
                                to me, yet so hard to explain in words : now I can explain it<B> :</B> the subconscious impression of pain before puberty, the conscious but 
                                repressed experience at puberty, confirmed by every experience in adolescent 
                                and adult life ... people avoid pain ... people develop habits. 
                              <P>If I may digress - <BR>
                                It wasn`t long after making my discovery that I was re-confronted with 
                                the rather larger human problem of closed mindedness .... the mind 
                                runs in habits like rabbit runs ..... phimotic mindedness - What could 
                                we have discovered if we`d have been looking in the right places? <BR>
                                Ok we`ve understood basic psychology and now we`ve got computers, I 
                                mean I dont want to appear cynical, but who knows what history will 
                                write? .... <BR>
                                What leads to peace of mind? - I wish the modern world had tried to 
                                answer this question.
                              <P>At an early age I discovered the enjoyment, peace and fulfillment of simply doing nothing except being aware
                                of my breathing and body. I often wonder if this might have been stimulated by the prenatal classes which my mother
                                attended. She learnt her breathing and relaxation exercises while I was in her womb. </P>
                              <P>I dont mind if you dont understand what I write here, but I dont want 
                                to sound arrogant - its a habit, I believe a lucky habit, which I learnt 
                                quite young. Essentially I enjoy "this" pulsating warm energy bundle.
                                
                              <P>The basis is simply being aware of the breathing and body and this 
                                can lead off in various ways.
                                
                              <P>On breathing: ("some breath hot while others breathe cold" <I>Tao-te-ching</I>) sense the cooler in-breath, the
                                warmer out-breath. <BR>
                                Try flaring the nostrils on the in-breath. It opens the cheeks, your eyes, your senses, stimulates happiness (honest, try it). Consider how modern man has lost the feeling
                                for flaring the nostrils, it really is an all cure, even helps prevent the common cold. </P>
                              <P>Listening into the distance is another very relaxing experience. Do it in quiet surroundings, e.g. at night, listen to
                                cars passing into the distance. ... I suppose its like a stretching exercise for the ears.</P>
                              <P>Its not all so deep and mystical, its just something I feel I do naturally, once the TVs off ... and I`m sitting round just before getting bored ... :-)
                                
                              <P>I recently discovered the chi-gong exercise of looking over the 
                                left shoulder, through the corner of the left eye, (then repeating 
                                this to the right). To look as far and focussed as possible, one must 
                                open the corner of the eye - this in turn opens the temples and in 
                                turn stimulates open-mindedness ... (gently turn the head naturally 
                                while doing the exercise). Use your common sense as with all experiments.</P>
                              <P>Connected with this, and I believe excellent for tired computer 
                                eyes: Focus on a point, but then, be conscious of what you see with 
                                your peripheral vision. - It must all be connected with the so called 
  &quot;fixed staring&quot; in Zen - on the bus its easy and natural 
                                to do, just fix somewhere upfront (on the roof so nothing blocks your 
                                view,) and then just be aware of the things passing by the windows 
                                on both sides and stimulate your peripheral vision.</P>
                              <P>Ask "Who breathes?" or "Who hears ?" or "What is this?" as a better 
                                way of phrasing the linguistic conundrum "Why am I?" 
                              <P>And, not to forget, ... to break taboos, (and quite generally with 
                                problems which appear unsoluble) - try thinking of questions which 
                                seem illogical, irrational or apparently impossible.</P>                              </TD>

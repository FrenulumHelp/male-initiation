        <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Psychological research has concentrated on parental 
          and environmental phenomenon, and the urological disciplines do not 
          include sexual behaviour. Scientific research has overlooked this area 
          of human sexuality. </FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P></TD>

                              received no name, as that the phenomenon of the erosion or laceration 
                              of the frenum and its alae, though not unknown, receives so little 
                              attention, and is even manifestly neglected in medical literature. 
                              . . . That excoriation of the frenum praeputii has also been neglected 
                              by psychiatrists and psychoanalysts is even more remarkable."
                              <P>"The psychodynamics of this repression on the part of the physicians 
                                is a striking phenomenon in itself. It cannot be masculine pride 
                                alone ... which has caused the phenomenon to be neglected by male 
                                physicians and psychoanalysts, and caused it to be forgotten in 
                                dermatological literature. ... resulting in a general or collective 
                                repression of the phenomenon."<A HREF="../xtras/refs.html#ref82">(82)</A>. 
                                While Grewel was referring principally to the frenulum, the above 
                                statements seems valid for all the persisting and painful conditions.                              </P>
                              <P><B><A NAME="hamburg"></A> </B>After saying that psycho/sexual 
                                experiences due to frenulum breve were to be seen as delusions, 
                                the head psychologist at the Institute of Sexual Research in Hamburg 
                                informed me that they have seen many men who believed that their 
                                frenulum breve condition was the cause of their sexual disturbances. <A HREF="../xtras/refs.html#ref61">(61)</A>
                              
                              <P>This is significant, <A HREF="../medicus/grewel.html#start">Grewel</A> also reports frequent cases. Why do so many men consult the psychologist 
                              about these phenomena instead of the Urologist?                               
                              <P>They themselves 
                                appear to believe that an anatomical problem could not influence 
                                sexual behaviour or perhaps they consider that worries about ones 
                                penis are symptomatic for a psychological problem, the psychologists 
                                certainly confirm this.
                              <P>Some men will say "Yes it causes pain and tension, but that is 
                                not the problem"; it appears that admitting to a psychological dysfunction 
                                is preferable to admitting to a foreskin problem. It is the responsibility 
                                of sexual advisors to use common sense and advise these men that 
                                with painful erections one can expect psychological disturbances.
                              <P><B>It is surely, primarily the responsibility of the Institutes 
                              for Sexual Research to actually research these sexual phenomena. </B>
                              
                              <P>As mentioned one psychologist at the Hamburg Institute for Sexual Research  informed me that 
                                they have seen many men who believed that their frenulum breve condition 
                                was the cause of their sexual disturbances. When it was suggested 
                                that these men may be correct in their assumptions, the answer was 
                                that this is not the case because &quot;... they had it cut away 
                                and then there was no change in their disturbances&quot; <A HREF="../xtras/refs.html#ref61">(61)</A>. 
                              <P>What an incredible world these psychological specialists live 
                                in! - Surgery cannot be expected to change ingrained personality 
                                traits and self images in any significant way. As an adult, the 
                                sufferer has adapted to, and has identified with his modified personality, 
                                so even after the operation, unless he brings the process to consciousness, 
                                no difference will occur. 
                              <P>Then consider that without a good listener or other encouragement, 
                                repressed phenomena have little chance of becoming conscious. It 
                                is unfortunate that friends will have as much interest in his condition 
                                as if he had ingrowing toe-nails, but more disturbing is that highly 
                                trained (and highly paid) psychologists and therapists will attempt 
                                to persuade him to endure further unecessary upheavel by reviewing 
                                his childhood and the relationship with his parents. 
                              <P>This  traditional methods of analysis was openly 
                                supported by a second expert at The Institute for Sexual Research 
                                in Hamburg <A HREF="../xtras/refs.html#ref93">(93)</A>. 
                                It is obvious that these experts have no understanding of the anatomical 
                                effects of foreskin conditions; no understanding of their behavioural 
                                symptoms and no interest in any patients explanations. 
                              <P>Incidently <A HREF="../medicus/grewel.html#start">Grewel</A> and <A HREF="../medicus/wabrek.html#start">Wabrek</A> (sexual therapists who understood something of foreskin conditions) were discovered 
                                in Hamburg`s sexual research department`s own library. - <A HREF="../medicus/wabrek.html#start">Wabrek</A> is discussed in                                 <A HREF="common_sense.html#start">NOTES for the SEXUAL THERAPIST</A>

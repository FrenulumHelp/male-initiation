        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:   My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                            <P>My original interviewed sample group before going on-line, 
                              covered an extended circle of friends I have in Germany and England 
                              ... we are talking about a group of around 120 people (approx. 30 women 
                              and 90 men) between 25 - 40 yrs.old and though there are limits to 
                              my social flexibility, I believe this represents a fair cross section 
                              and the findings give a good general survey. A sort of street level 
                              impression, the grass roots of a taboo. (Since being on line I have 
                              had contact with a far more limited cross section of the general public 
                              - ie. mainly only those with actual problems). 
                            <P>People's reactions when I started talking about foreskin conditions 
                              were generally not very welcoming. The subject was completely refused 
                              by about 10%. Often I felt this was a gut reaction, and I could sympathise 
                              because when I first got involved with the subject it used to make 
                              me feel bad in my stomach ... These days I usually introduce the subject 
                              by talking about male initiation in the modern world . . . the response 
                              is very much better. 
                            <P><B>PUBLIC AWARENESS</B><BR>
                              My first surprise was that women were generally far more able to think 
                              about the subject than men were. The majority of the older women I 
                              questioned had sons or lovers with whom they had experienced the problems. 
                              It is obvious who men with these problems have talked to. Around thirty 
                              women informed me of as many cases.</P>
                            <P>Mature women reported sometimes up to 3 or 4 cases, (ie far more 
                              than the men ever did) while many of these stories may be the nature 
                              of exaggerated rumours what is very interesting is that in some social 
                              groups in Germany, there is obviously a grapevine of information among 
                              women warning young mothers about the possible requirement of male 
                              cirucmcision. One young mother reporting that two older colleagues 
                              had warned her to check her young boy. 
                            <P> I spoke with around 15 cases personally. In Germany I heard more 
                              cases of puberty problems and it was generally men from the UK who 
                              discovered late. Though some of these men encouraged my research, generally 
                              they didn't particularly want to remember the episode. Most of them 
                              had not understood what had happened to them, or why the operation 
                              had been necessary. Some felt their case was a rarity and thus 
                              not worth complaining about. Simple rips of the frenulum and 
                              partial phimosis causing pain during masturbation 
                              were fairly common experiences. (e.mail writers only rarely 
                              report these, (or when reported in e.mail only as part of a longer 
                              story)).</P>
                            <P>From around 70 "normal" happily foreskinned men many had never heard 
                              of foreskin conditions. I often sensed a feeling of disgust as soon 
                              as I broached the subject. I was informed by a few "of course it's 
                              not taboo", however on asking it was clear they had never talked about 
                              the subject before.</P>
                            <P>Some had heard one story (e.g. of a friend in childhood who had 
                              stretched the foreskin) and genuinely believed that was the entire 
                              subject. Often I heard: "So, you discover it, you receive treatment, 
                              it's simple, and why make all this fuss" </P>
                            <P>Something else worth mentioning, is that among those unhappily and 
                              happily foreskinned males I spoke with, if a converstaion developed, 
                              there was a remarkably clear 45 minute time limit, not that anyone 
                              looked at a clock, but I believe I noticed more clearly than in 20 
                              years of teaching, that 45 mins is the limit for new information. 
                            <P>And then came my second surprise (surely from a far too small sample 
                              but), all four men who had been circumcised at birth were open minded 
                              and have discussed the subject for at least 2 hours, and all of them 
                              of their own accord have started to talk about the subject again! Why 
                              is there such a remarkable difference in the ability of different people 
                              to consider this phenomenon, does this taboo stem from uncircumcised 
                              societies, are those men circumcised at in childhood more open to thinking 
                              about the foreskin? - (In this context it is worth considering that 
                              almost everyone involved with the subject on-line - both pro and anti 
                              - are circumcised).</P>
                            <P><B>&quot;WHY DID IT TAKE YOU SO LONG?&quot;<BR>
                              </B>If a conversation developed, by far the most frequent question 
                              and usually the first was "Why did it take you so long to discover?". 
                              this was often the first and the only question which occurred. It is 
                              in my opinion the main answer to the question. "Why hasn't anyone else 
                              said anything?" This question must have embarrassed a million men into 
                              silence. </P>
                            <P> It surprised me how often therapists and psychologists asked this; 
                              surely such late discoveries occur frequently with lots of people in 
                              lots of different walks of life. 
                            <P>Answer:<BR>
                              From a psychological or behavioural perspective I had a condition which 
                              was painful at puberty, and, people avoid pain. To summarise: the lack 
                              of awareness was probably stimulated by uncomfortable experiences previous 
                              to puberty, a learned experience of difficulty at puberty, and this 
                              was reinforced after puberty, for example every time I masturbated, 
                              i.e. in the same way any other habit develops and reinforces itself. 
                              - and I believed I was normal, and ...like you ... I never thought 
                              an anatomical inhibition was possible. 
                            <P><B>HANDICAPS<BR>
                              </B>When the conversation continued and developed a few people understood 
                              the problem as a handicap and said that there are methods of coping 
                              with handicaps so that they don't lead automatically to a disintergration 
                              of the personality.</P>
                            <P>When a handicap is conscious one has the choice of confronting it, 
                              and in coming to terms with it, one can even turn it to some greater 
                              strength. In addition, once they are recognised, most handicaps are 
                              accepted by society, there are self help groups, therapists, doctors 
                              understand and the sufferer is at least acknowledged by others. Let 
                              alone accepted by anyone else, this is often unknown and unrecognised 
                              by the sufferer himself 
                            <P>A real handicap is something which cannot be corrected. These conditions 
                              are often not recognised and once the individual does realise he can 
                              seek treatment, and (unless the doctor or parents prohibit a youth 
                              under 18) they are then very simply cured and never needed be a problem. 
                              Up until they are treated, it would be more correct to consider as 
                              an inhibition. 
                            <P><B>SUMMARY</B><BR>
                              From the response I received and the sort of questions I was asked, 
                              I find it understandable that the men concerned, prefer to forget the 
                              whole experience, rather than confronting it and risking (even in their 
                              own mind) the possible risk of being judged as making a big fuss about 
                              their own little problem-ridden penis....Thus no-one talks, thus there 
                              is a taboo ... 
                            <P><B>RED HERRINGS and MINEFIELDS</B> <BR>
                              There is a large block of habitual, routine and, it could easily be 
                              called, phimotic thinking on this subject. If people had never heard 
                              of the subject then it would be far easier to talk with them. Most 
                              people had some half-forgotten crazy idea in the back of their heads 
                              about circumcision - &quot;Wasn't it meant to cure masturbation?&quot;. 
                              As I tried to describe that "people avoid pain", many people assumed 
                              I was trying to tell them that the operation itself was painful ... 
                              the traditional operation and the modern medical one lie world's apart 
                              ...</P>
                            <P>It was often suggested to me that the Jews and the Muslims must 
                              know the reason why they circumcise. When I attempted to explain my 
                              ideas to a Rabbi he said "We have no interest in why it should be done 
                              ... God commanded it." </P>
                            <P>The most common red herring people get lost with is undoubtably: 
  "should boys be circumcised or not?" Coupled with this, to confirm 
                              the confusion, is the popular idea that whether one is circumcised 
                              or not makes no difference to the sexuality (and all this goes hand 
                              in hand with the rumour that `everyone's normal'). Such generalisations 
                              support socially acceptable myths about manhood without taking into 
                              consideration the individual conditions which do not meet the norm, 
                              where the foreskin is restrained, trapped, inhibited or painful. </P>
                            <P>I found a great many men had secret worries or pride, on size and 
                              shape of their penis. It is then curious how deep and fixed the idea 
                              is among &quot;normal men&quot; that : what you've GOT physically is 
                              not important, - it's what you ARE that counts. 
                            <P>The popular modern myths about manhood maintain a sort of male status 
                              quo or public image which most men with doubts or pride can adjust 
                              to, however exactly because a public admission of pride or worry about 
                              one`s genital equipment is socially unacceptable, then this self-image 
                              remains private and possibly embarrassingly hidden, ... what seems 
                              unfair in this context is that those men with a bent or shorter phallus 
                              have to eat the hard cheese, while those with a straight 7 inches can 
                              contentedly maintain the myths. </P>
                            <P>Male identity and mandhood in the modern world need far deeper discussion 
                              to arrive at a realistic answer to these questions. Relevant to this 
                              discussion is that sexual problems due to parental or environmental 
                              phenomenon are commonly understood and recognised, such problems are 
                              in fact culturally accepted, psychologists and friends are far more 
                              receptive to such ideas. 
                            <P>On the other hand, the idea that anatomical conditions can lead 
                              to seuxual and in turn psychological problems seems against every advance 
                              our culture has made in understanding. 
                            <P> It is blatantly clear to me with my personal experience (thorn

        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

  <I>British Medical Journal VOL.306:1-2 (2 January 1993) </I></P>
                              <P>Three reliable medical studies show that phimosis alone in the flaccid 
                                state occurs at a frequency of around 8.8%. I published this in the 
                                Internet Newsgroups. A study by Gordon and Collin was cited in order 
                                to show that the real statistic was in fact 1%...</P>
                              <P>Gordon and Collin merely quote &Oslash;ster's statistics. It is 
                                possible that they, like many other researchers, simply took these 
                                statistics at face value <A HREF="../../re_oster.html#start">(See Reinterpretation 
                                  of &Oslash;ster)</A>. However, on studying Gordon and Collin's paper 
                                I find it a generally discreditable source of information.</P>
                              <P>On the subject of ballooning as an indication for circumcision, 
                                I find their misrepresentations, of both Gairdner and &Oslash;ster, 
                                unforgivable.</P>
                              <P>Gordon and Collin write : &quot;Although ballooning on micturition 
                                is a commonly cited indication, the studies of Gairdner[1] and &Oslash;ster[2] 
                                suggest that if this physical sign is ignored the symptoms will resolve 
                                as the foreskin becomes spontaneously retractile&quot;</P>
                              <P>Gairdner wrote : &quot;Occasionally the preputial orifice is imperfectly 
                                related to the external meatus, so that the urinary stream balloons 
                                out the subpreputial space; this can be easily remedied by gently separating 
                                the prepuce from the glans in the region of the meatus by means of 
                                a probe.&quot;</P>
                              <P>Gairdner is quite clear that these problems should not be ignored 
  &quot;whereas a non-retractable prepuce in the young child should be 
                                accepted with equanimity as normal, after about 3 years of age steps 
                                should be taken to render the prepuce of all boys retractable and capable 
                                of being kept clean.&quot;</P>
                              <P>Added to this, &Oslash;ster never mentions ballooning!</P>
                              <P>&Oslash;ster may have been very confusing with his mathematics, 
                                but he attempted to give an accurate unbiased report. Gordon and Collin's 
                                misrepresentations are clearly the result of prejudice or an indescribable 
                                lack of intelligence. I honestly feel we should ignore Gordon and Collin 
                                - maybe if we do this, they'll spontaneously retract.</P>

        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P>Shankar and Rickwood<BR>
                                  <B>Conclusions<BR>
                                  </B>The incidence of pathological phimosis in boys was 0.4 cases/1000 
                                boys per year, or 0.6% of boys affected by their 15th birthday, a value 
                                lower than previous estimates and exceeded more than eight-fold by 
                                the proportion of English boys currently circumcised for `phimosis` </P>
                              <P>RS. So, the point seems to be that circumcision is performed too 
                                often ... I agree but while I agree with their basic attitude and their 
                                results, their research and methods leaves much to be desired - the 
                                evidence needs to be re-evaluated. 
                              <P>RS: First confusion is the title - this study is not the incidence 
                                of phimosis - this study is an attempt to measure how often BXO occurrs 
                                in cases of phimosis when the phimosis is discovered up to age 15 and 
                                treated by circumcision. 
                              <P>Shankar and Rickwood<BR>
                                  <B>Introduction</B><BR>
                                There is general acceptance that pathological phimosis, with cicatrization 
                                of the preputial orifice, usually caused by balanitis xerotica obliterans 
                                (BXO) represents the one absolute indication for circumcision. However, 
                                the incidence of this complaint and hence the proportion of boys unquestionably 
                                needing circumcision remains to be established, as the little data 
                                that exists enable only an approximation. 
                              <P>RS. How often BXO or LSA occurrs with phimosis has already been 
                                measured by M. Meuli, et al 10%; Kristiansen et al 15%; Chalmers et 
                                al. 14% and Clemmensen 19%. - Shankar and Rickwood make no mention 
                                of these figures. 
                              <P>Shankar and Rickwood &quot;Among 173 boys serially examined by &Oslash;ster 
                                from 6-17 years of age, three developed `secondary` phimosis, presumptively 
                                pathological, giving an incidence of 1.7%&quot; 
                              <P>RS. &Oslash;ster serially examined 1,968 boys not 173 - the adolescents 
                                who had persistant phimosis at the end of &Oslash;ster`s 7 years education 
                                and examinations must be included in any well researched speculation 
                                - </P>
                              <P>RS: (Of great speculative interest - when we take such statistical 
                                acrobatics seriously is - 3 boys with secondary phimosis into 1,968 
                                gives an incidence of 0.0656% and this is considerably less than Shankar 
                                and Rickwood 0.6% showing perhaps that early monitoring and education 
                                can help to prevent LSA.)</P>
                              <P>Shankar and Rickwood &quot;The study comprised a review of all medically 
                                indicated circumcisions performed for `phimosis` at Alder Hey Children`s 
                                Hospital during the 2 years from July 1996 onward, on boys resident 
                                in the Liverpool and Sefton Health Districts. These Districts, with 
                                a population of boys aged 0-14 years of <FONT FACE=Symbol>&raquo;</FONT>76&nbsp;000, 
                                are serviced exclusively for paediatric purposes by this hospital.&quot; </P>
                              <P>RS. Am I truly meant to believe that in England where children are 
                                not monitored that every case of phimosis is discovered? The point 
                                is that the cases which were discovered were the more noticable cases 
                                e.g. those cases where an infection was present.</P>
                              <P>Shankar and Rickwood: <B><FONT SIZE=3><BR>
                                Results</FONT><FONT FACE=Arial SIZE=3><BR>
  </FONT></B>During the 2-year period reviewed, 62 boys were circumcised 
                                for typical cicatrizing pathological phimosis, one 4 years old, the 
                                remainder aged 5-14 years. The circumcision specimens were examined 
                                histologically in 51 instances, 43 (84%) revealing appearances characteristic 
                                of BXO and nine of nonspecific dermal fibrosis. During this same period, 
                                30 boys (aged 0-14 years) were circumcised for developmental unretractability 
                                of the foreskin.(`physiological phimosis`).</P>
                              <P>RS so again I must question the statistical exactness of this study 
                                : 43 plus nine equals 52, yet there were only 51 histological examinations 
                                - and 30 boys with phimoses which might have stretched were circumcised. </P>
                              <P>RS We might well ask what happened to the other boys with unnoticed 
                                non-pathological phimosis? Then even to exaggerate Meuli; Kristiansen; 
                                Chalmers and Clemmensen`s statistic and estimate 20% of cases of phimosis 
                                are due to LSA, then against 43 cases of LSA we would expect to find 
                                at least 172 cases of `physiological phimosis` - and only 30 of these 
                                were discovered and treated (probably inappropriately) with circumcision 
                                - where are the 142 boys who are being presently being ignored by the 
                                English health care system? </P>
                              <P>RS: again I call for a routine monitoring and education of those 
                                boys who are unaware of retraction please see <A HREF="../../re_oster.html#start">&Oslash;ster

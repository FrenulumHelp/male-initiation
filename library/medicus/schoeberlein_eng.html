        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P>Summary: 3000 young men, most of them between 18 and 22 years old, 
                                were medically examined. The relationship between the prepuce and 
                                the glans penis was examined and the frequency of smegma was recorded. 
                                In 8.5% no prepuce was present, among approximately half of these 
                                there had been no previous operation. A phimosis was determined among 
                                8.8%. Smegma was found among 19.2%, including a 'large amount' among 
                                a 1/3. A comparison of the education and occupational groups of these 
                                young men revealed no difference in the frequency of uncleanliness. 
                                A hypospadie was found in 0.37%. 
                              <P>"Today cancer prevention is still a problem, however tomorrow the 
                                main concern will be the fight against cancer" (<I>K. H. Ba&uuml;er,1</I>). 
                                Despite all progress with diagnostics and therapy, the percentage 
                                of deaths due to cancer constantly increases, from 13,5% (1935) to 
                                20,04% (1961) (1). Part of cancer prevention concerns the recognition 
                                and elimination of cancerous materials. No more doubts exist about 
                                the cancerous effects of tobacco tar derivatives related to lung 
                                cancer (1, 39). Just as undisputed, but admittedly less known, is 
                                the cancerous effect of smegma (1, 3, 15, 19, 23, 24, 29, 33, 39). 
                              <P>Penis cancer is observed in Europe and North America in 1-3% of 
                                all male cases of cancer (1, 4, 6, 17, 19, 21).
                              <P>In the USSR in recent years 0.5 to 1% of male cancer cases were 
                                registered as penis cancer (33). In North Vietnam 15.6%, in India 
                                up to 25.6% in China 15.8 to 18.3% and in Siam 22.0 to 33.0% of the 
                                male cases of cancer are penis cancer (1, 23, 33). 
                              <P><I>Thierch</I> (1865) described the continuous friction of a phimosis 
                                as a cause of penis cancer and <I>Czerny</I> (1899) determined, that 
                                circumcision against penis cancer "immunised and encourages thorough 
                                cleanliness and removal of preputial secretions" (7, 37). Many authors 
                                later confirmed that penis cancer occurs practically only with phimosis 
                                (1, 6, 11, 17, 18, 20, 23, 31, 32, 38).
                              <P>The observation that there is no penis cancer among the circumcised 
                                Jews is further proof of the causal connection between prepuce, smegma 
                                and penis cancer (1, 4, 21, 31).
                              <P>The ever recurring idea that this concerns a Jewish race immunity 
                                (18), can be disproved by investigations in different countries and 
                                among other peoples. In India among 2260 cancer patients, penis cancer 
                                was found among uncircumcised Hindus in 25.6% cases, in contrast 
                                among the circumcised Muslims only 2.9% (25). Marchionini confirms 
                                this ratio for the Islamic population of Turkey (23). In 1964 it 
                                was reported in Kazachstan, that among 87 cases of penis cancer only 
                                4 (4.6%) were found among the Muslims who circumcise at the age of 
                                4 - 6 years, however they constitute 36% of the population. This 
                                difference can only be explained by circumcision. However the later 
                                this is performed, the smaller is the protection against the occurrence 
                                of penis cancer. Cancer has a characteristic time of latency even 
                                in this area (1, 33). Penis cancer, occurs at the average age of 
                                54.5 years and is located 41% on the Glans, 32% on the inside of 
                                the prepuce and 25% at the sulcus coronarius of the glans (collum 
                                glandis: internally. Nomenclature, Paris, 1963) (21). 
                              <P>This fact is explained by a cancer stimulating agent within the 
                                preputial room: smegma, which is composed of degenerated fats, rubbed 
                                off and dead epithelial cells and not the secretion of any glands. 
                                Stieve could find glands neither on the surface of the glans nor 
                                on the inner foreskin. There are no tallow glands there (35). Smegma 
                                production occurs among newborns and reaches its high point during 
                                the teenage years (33). 
                              <P>The embryonic development of the prepuce begins in the 8th week 
                                as the epithelium sinks into connective tissue at the base of the 
                                glans. Thus a fold forms, which extends up until the 5th month as 
                                a fold of prepuce over the glans. 
                              <P>With the growth of this fold, the later epithelium of the glans 
                                and the inner foreskin remain together in a common layer, the glandarlamelle. 
                                Toward the end of the foetal life the central cells of this lamella 
                                begin to disintegrate. Cavities develop and unite forming a common 
                                preputial hollow area (9, 10) This procedure is only rarely completed 
                                at birth and it is unfounded to speak at this stage of anything being 
                                stuck or adhesions. For this condition the term "physiological phimosis" 
                                is particularly used by the pediatricians - coined by Winiwater 70 
                                years ago - (13, 28). This expression is not completely harmless 
                                and should be avoided due to the danger of late recognition of a 
                                phimosis and problems increasing. The process under examination is 
                                the incomplete separation of the prepuce and the glans, which without 
                                active assistance can take place spontaneously up to the 6th month 
                                in 20%, up to the 12th. month in 50%, up to the 2nd year in 80% and 
                                to end of the 3rd year in 90% of boys (10).<I> </I>A phimosis with 
                                the marginal connective tissue narrowing the foreskin opening, should 
                                be recognised early and be operated as soon as possible. 
                              <P>The cancerous effects of smegma could be proven several times so 
                                far in studies on animals (5, 27).
                              <P>Operationally created phimosis increased the frequency of experimentally 
                                produced penis cancer among Rabbits (33). The observations are interesting 
                                among horses, where due to the abundantly folding foreskin smegma 
                                is found in large quantities and penis cancer occurs particularly 
                                frequently, counting for 23% of all cancer illnesses in this animal 
                                species. Whales, among whom without erection the smegma is not emptied, 
                                become ill with penis cancer ten times more frequently than Studs 
                                (15). 
                              <P>Apart from other factors, the cancer encouraging agent smegma is 
                                responsible for cervical cancer among woman (1, 3, 11, 21, 39). Jewesses 
                                become substantially more rarely ill with cancer of the cervix than 
                                non-Jewish women; the relationship uterus to cervical cancer is among 
                                Jewesses 6:1, among non-Jewish women 1:8. This ratio is also confirmed 
                                in all countries where a proportion of the male population is circumcised 
                                (1). 
                              <P>"The smegma theory cannot be excluded as the cause of penis cancer 
                                among men, among women it is an important fact" (<I>K. H. Farmer</I> [1]). 
                              <P>To prevent the effect of this smegma which is recognised as so 
                                dangerous, in the USA for the last 15 years 80-90% of all male newborn 
                                children are circumcised straight after birth. Apart from episiotomy, 
                                which is likewise performed as a preventive measure, circumcision 
                                is the most frequent operation of the American birth aids (2l, 26). 
                                It is usually done with the "Gomco clamp", which in Germany has also 
                                proven to work satisfactorily as a safe and simply performed operation 
                                (14, 21). 
                              <P>From a personal report from Wynder (1965) the American insurance 
                                independently honour these preventive measures. The general introduction 
                                in Germany would fail due to this among other reasons, because for 
                                a long time other preventive measures demanded by the medical profession, 
                                for example a general Tetanus immunisation, has so far not been accepted 
                                by any health insurance companies . 
                              <P>In England 24% of the boys up to 4 years old, and at the same time 
                                84% of Cambridge students were found to be without a prepuce. Physicians 
                                and midwives recommend circumcision there. Many Englishmen know the 
                                particularly impressive advantages of circumcision from the colonial 
                                times in India (16). In Germany the results of first experiences 
                                with routine circumcision were published in 1959 (14). 80% of the 
                                previously asked parents decided to give their permission for this 
                                operation, without knowing anything about the value and the meaning 
                                of this operation beforehand. Such open-mindedness was unexpected. 
                                The small operation with the Gomco Clamp did not result in any complications<I>.</I>
                              <P>In Germany a statement from the medical profession has long been 
                                demanded on the question of the general ablatio praeputii among new 
                                born boys (16, 23, 30). The main argument against a general circumcision 
                                is stated again and again, that this problem can also be resolved 
                                by regular cleaning with soap and water (1, 7, 23, 33). 
                              <P>Own Investigations 
                              <P>In order to make an objective evaluation about this statement possible, 
                                3000 young men were given a detailed medical examination of the penis,

                                retractability. Whether "smegma" was present or even "a lot of smegma" 
                                was registered. The investigations were carried out by Dr. E. Moessmer, 
                                Specialist for Urology in Munich, whom I thank here for his assistance, 
                                and myself, each conducted half of the examinations in order to increase 
                                the objectivity. These were young men from Southern Germany. 2527 
                                (84.2%) were of an age between 18-22 years; the exact breakdown of 
                                the age distribution is shown in tab. 1

                              <P>Regarding group A, we found 256 (8,5%) of the examined to be without 
                                a prepuce. Among approximately one quarter of this group, reports 
                                or scars from a circumcision could be established. Among a proportion 
                                of these, the reports were questionable, the question of surgery 
                                was denied among approx. half the young men without prepuce, and 
                                no evidence of an operation could be found. In addition, among a 
                                large percent I received confirmation from the mother that no surgery 
                                had been performed on their son. There is no doubt, that the lack 
                                of, or atrophy of the foreskin occurs spontaneously among approx. 
                                4% of young men. 
                              <P>We defined 1258 (41.9%) of the examined as "B" and found smegma 
                                among 149 (11.8%) of these; among approx.1/3 it was designated as 
                                "very much". 
                              <P>1223 (40.8%) of the 3000 examined were registered as "C". There 
                                were 297 (24.3%) with smegma and likewise among half "very much" 
                                was noted. In this group sometimes the long, tubular form of prepuce 
                                was found, which has also been called "pseudophimosis" (19). If the 
                                foreskin opening was elastic and retractable, this means the long 
                                foreskin was functional and presented no substantial obstacle to 
                                the possibilities of cleaning. 
                              <P>Due to the histological structure of the prepuce it is to be expected, 
                                that in the course of time in many of these "C" cases the relation 
                                of the glans to prepuce changes and develops into form "B&quot;. 
                                Both groups belong therefore together, particularly in view of the 
                                cleaning possibilities. It is clearly noticeable that the smegma 
                                frequency increases with the length of the prepuce (35). 
                              <P>Regarding form "D"; the phimosis with an inelastic, fibrous hardened 
                                preputial opening, where only with effort and under pressure small 
                                front parts of the glans show, we determined this form among 181 
                                (6.0%) of the young men; 64 (35.3%) of whom had smegma, with half 
                                of these classified as "very much". The smegma here can only be partly 
                                removed; it is evidently present, but not always visible. 
                              <P>The condition "E"; the phimosis with a rigid, stiff preputial opening, 
                                without any possibility of expansion and where no glans or orificium 
                                urethrae can be seen, we found this among 82 (2,8%). In this group 
                                smegma is always present, objectively however not ascertainable. 
                                Therefore we registered this group separately to "D". 
                              <P>The phimosis (D + E) gives a total number of 263 = 8,8%. These 
                                are pathological conditions and should be eliminated operationally. 
                                Most of the subjects had not realised the unhealthiness of their 
                                condition. We advised them all to undertake the small operation and 
                                always found a thankful open-minded reception for the explanation. 
                                Also Haller (12) describes, that young men between 20 and 30 years 
                                frequently complain, that the operation was neglected in childhood. 
                              <P>In 1960 Saitmacher (29) studied 229 young men of an age between 
                                15 and 17 years, and found 8.7% had phimosis. Gairdner (10) studied 
                                200 uncircumcised boys between 5 and 13 year old and discovered a 
                                phimosis in 6%, and a foreskin which was only partially retractable 
                                among 14%. Otherwise substantially lower numbers for the frequency 
                                of the phimosis are indicated in the literature; thus Keil (16) quotes 
                                l% and Koester (19) only 0.5 to I%, however without indicating a 
                                source for this figure. 
                              <P>Smegma was found in our investigations among 19.2% of the groups 
                                B, C and D. Saitmacher (29) describes unceanliness of the preputial 
                                area in 33.2% of his 229 young men. Our young men were invited to 
                                the medical examination, thus some had surely washed themselves previously. 
                                When we include group E, among whom smegma production and accumulation 
                                are surely present, and consider the cleaning previous to an examination, 
                                a frequency of 30-35% smegma accumulation is no overestimation among 
                                young sexually mature men. 
                              <P>We determined a hypospadie among 11 of the 3.000 examined (0.37%). 
                                We saw no case of infant "adhesions", better called incomplete release 
                                of the foreskin. 
                              <P>It is often maintained, that genital hygiene is lacking, and general 
                                uncleanliness is found predominantly among the poorer or less educated 
                                sections of the population (19, 22). For this reason our 3000 young 
                                men were categorised according to their education (tab. 3) and their 
                                different occupational groups (tab. 4).

                              <P>Both tables show, that neither the education nor the occupational 
                                group make any considerable difference in the frequency of uncleanliness 
                                (smegma). The social achievement levels examined by us do not correspond 
                                exactly to proportions in the general population. We had less unskilled 
                                workers and the percentage of high school graduates (19,6%) was nearly 
                                three times the proportion of the high school graduates (7,2%) of 
                                the resident population of the Federal Republic of 1964 among the 
                                same age group. 
                              <P>153 (5%) of the 3000 men were married, among these we found only 
                                8,5% with smegma. It is doubtful, whether this is to be explained 
                                with greater cleanliness alone; regular cohabitation appears to help 
                                a form of cleaning. 
                              <P>Up until this time the necessity of regularly cleaning the preputial 
                                area as well as the dysfunctionality of phimosis was mostly unknown 
                                to the sufferers. During instruction about these questions the young 
                                men always showed themselves to be interested and open minded. There 
                                is insufficient sexual education of young men, especially about these 
                                problems, by the parents and by the school and house doctor. This 
                                is primarily due to a taboo, the people around him maintain distance, 
                                feeling embarrassed about instructing the boy on the subject of manipulation 
                                of the glans, and thereby perhaps arousing his sexuality prematurely. 
                                For decades such an education and instruction of young people has 
                                been demanded again and again. Our investigations show however a 
                                quite unsatisfactory picture. 
                              <P>By contrast, in view of the recognised danger of smegma, a general 
                                circumcision of all newborn children, as in the anglo-saxon countries, 
                                would mean a final and simple solution (4, 6, 14, 21). Apart from 
                                the advantages already described like: <BR>
                                a) prevention of penis cancer, <BR>
                                b) probable reduction of cervical cancer, also recognised are: <BR>
                                c) less venereal diseases (23), <BR>
                                d) improvement of the sexual physiology and psychology, by extension 
                                of the length of cohabitation among other aspects (8, 16, 23), <BR>
                                e) allegedly smaller frequency of prostate gland cancer (23), <BR>
                                f) avoidance of balanitis and balanoposthitis, e.g. with lack of 
                                water, during catastrophes, in the tropics or during war (21, 34). 
                              <P>Disadvantages are not known. The operation among newborn children 
                                using modern methods (Gomco clamp) is without danger and risk (14, 
                                21, 29).
                              <P>Whether and when the decision of the German medical profession 
                                will fall, regarding the already often repeated demand by respectable 
                                clinics recommending a routine circumcision, is uncertain (1, 14, 
                                16, 19, 23, 29, 30). The purpose and intention of this work was the 
                                rare possibility, to systematically examine and report on such a 
                                large number of young men of sexually mature age in this subject 
                                afflicted with so many prejudices 
                              <P>In conclusion then again, without weakening the request for general 
                                circumcision, the urgent demand must be made for sexual education 
                                from the parents, teachers, house doctors, pediatricians, school 
                                and work doctors.

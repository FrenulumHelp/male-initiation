        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P>Phimosis is recorded at less than 1% in two reports from school 
                                medical check-ups where eyes lungs etc. are all checked, the similarity 
                                of these two results must be significant and I suggest it reflects 
                                an extremely narrow definition of phimosis.

                                School medical records of 1000 children born in 1981 were studied retrospectively. 
                                They showed that once known medical problems and those screened for 
                                by the school nurse (hearing, vision, growth) were excluded, only 17 
                                problems requiring treatment were discovered: speech (n = 10), development 
                                (n = 3), undescended testes (n = 3), and phimosis (n = 1).

  "In the present study, we have carried out an evaluation of school 
                                examinations in 47,943 children in the past course. We have compared 
                                our results with those from similar previous studies in other parts 
                                of Spain. Our findings were comparable in visual acuity and scoliosis, 
                                and not so much about cryptorchidism and phimosis. We think that examinations 
                                are necessary, but it is needed to increase the quality and the effectiveness, 
                                to get closer to the knowledge of usefulness and to the correct evaluation 
                                of school health programs."

  "This work describes regional differences in Spanish pediatric hospital 
                                admissions." This is not a study on the frequency of phimosis, it records 
                                only how often in different age groups phimosis is diagnosed leading 
                                to a hospital admission. <BR>
  <FONT SIZE="2"> "PATIENTS AND METHODS: National, regional, age-specific 
    and diagnostic-specific discharge rates were obtained from the 1987 
    Hospital Morbidity Survey. To assess regional variations, weighted 
    coefficient of variations (WCV) were obtained. RESULTS: The overall 
    national discharge rate was 60.45 discharges per 1000 children less 
    than 15 years of age. The weighted coefficient of variation obtained 
    for the sex and age adjusted discharge rates of the 10 more frequent 
    diagnoses was highest for phimosis (56.13) and lowest for appendicitis 
    (19.44). CONCLUSIONS: Differences in supply and professional practice 
    style have been recognized as causes for the variations in hospital 
    utilization. Hospitalization of patients represents costs and risks. 
    They are justified when scientific evidence shows that their suggested 
    benefits overcome their inconveniences. The existence of this difference 
    leads to suspect that non-clinical factors could be decisive in medical 
    decisions."</FONT>         </TD></TR></TABLE></TD>

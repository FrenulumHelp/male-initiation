        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                                ANALYSIS</B> <BR>
                                The observations support the general trend of decrease in frequency 
                                with age however when added together these 6 recent studies cover a 
                                sample of at most 167 boys over the age of 11 yrs. 
                              <P><B>SUMMARY</B>
                              <P><B>Lau</B> studied 1,196 uncircumcised children. All babies a non-retractable 
                                foreskin. ... 21% in the 3-4 years old group. ... ... less than 10% 
                                in the children after 8 years old were still having phimosis. In the 
                                11-12 years old group the incidence was 4.4% (My note: In the 11-12 
                                years old group the incidence refers to 3 cases in a sample of 68). 
  "Preputial adhesions ... The incidence of complete preputial retraction 
                                increased rapidly after 6-7 years old; after 10 years old this incidence 
                                increased to over 80%" 
                              <P><B>Kayaba</B> showed among 600 boys, a completely retracable prepuce 
                                gradually increased from 0% at age 6 months to 62.9% by 11 to 15 years, 
                                while that of a tight ring decreased with age from 84.3% to 8.6% (My 
                                note: there were only 35 studied cases among the 11-15 yr. olds) 
                              <P><B>Herzog</B> studied 259 - 272 (?) uncircumcised boys and reported 
                                65 boys between 6 and 12 yrs.old and a 9% phimosis rate 
                              <P><B>Branger</B> provides data on the outcome after forcible retraction." 
                                The common occurrence of this painful practice may have relieved many 
                                cases of phimosis though I question the healing value of any such painful 
                                process. Among 500 nursery school children 182 (36.4%) children had 
                                a history of forceful retraction. 318 (63.6%) had not undergone this 
                                painful process. Of these 318:- 204 had a fully retractable prepuce 
                                (64.9%), 99 had adhesions (56 of little importance, 43 covering half 
                                of the glans)-(31.1%), and 13 had phimosis (4%). 
                              <P><B>Fergusson</B> compares the different general problems between 
                                circumcised and uncircumcised boys among a group of more than 500 children. 
                                He reported phimosis occurred at 3.7% in boys under 8 yrs. old. "However 
                                episodes for which the child was brought to medical attention for "tight" 
                                or nonretractable" foreskin but was not treated were not classified 
                                as phimosis,"

                                This study deals with some preliminary observations on normal anatomic 
                                variants in 350 newborns ... "Phimosis if present was noted for its 
                                degree of severity. Phimosis was observed in 4.3% (15) cases only and 
                                degree of prepucial phimosis varied." <BR>
                                My note: from Table I it is clear that of the 350 studied cases only 
                                195 were male, therefore an incidence of 15 cases would result in 7.7% 
                                and not 4.3%.

                                adhesions were recorded. Phimosis or nonretractability was defined 
                                as tightness of the preputial orifice which prevented retraction of 
                                the foreskin to expose the glans, by gentle but steady manipulation. 
                              <P>Of the 1,235 children under 12 years old examined, 41 children were 
                                circumcised. ... Fourteen children had therapeutic circumcisions 
                              <P>All the 68 babies under the age of 6 months were found to have a 
                                non-retractable foreskin. This incidence decreased rapidly between 
                                6 months and the 2 years of age, and dropped to 21% in the 3-4 years 
                                old group. The incidence decreased gradually thereafter and less than 
                                10% in the children after 8 years old were still having phimosis. In 
                                the 11-12 years old group the incidence was 4.4%

                                for phimosis. 
                              <P>None of the 111 boys younger than 1 year had a fully retractable

                                tight ring decreased with age from 84.3 to 8.6% Nine boys had balanoposthitis. 
                                (My note: there were only 35 studied cases among the 11-15 yr. olds) 
                              <P>These findings indicater that incomplete preputial separation is 
                                common and normal in neonates and infants, and preputial separation 
                                progresses until school age. 
                              <P>In most male individuals preputial separation continues until adolescence, 
                                presumably to protect the immature glans penis. 
                              <P>My note: It is logical that boys have an immature glans penis if 
                                it has never been exposed - most boys can retract their foreskin and 
                                this allows their glans to become a little hardened to life`s realities.

                              <P>We performed a retrospective survey to determine the frequency of 
                                problems of the foreskin among uncircumcised children. Among 545 boys 
                                aged 4 months to 12 years, there were 272 uncircumcised boys and 273 
                                control patients who were circumcised at birth. 
                              <P>The study was carried out in two primary care clinics serving an 
                                inner population. We questioned the parents of all boys between the 
                                ages of 4 months and 12 years attending the clinic for health supervision 
                                visits. 
                              <P>the children were examined for the presence of phimosis (nonretractable 
                                foreskin) or adhesions. For cases in which complications were reported, 
                                we reviewed the medical record to confirm diagnosis. Only the cases 
                                in which diagnosis was confirmed were included. 
                              <P>Phimosis was considered to be a complication only when a patient 
                                had symptoms, such as dysuria, that were attributed to the phimosis 
                                by a physician. 
                              <P>Paraphimosis occurred in two patients and symptomatic phimosis in 
                                eight.

                                patients (8%) were circumcised late. Eleven circumcisions were done 
                                for medical reasons ... Eleven were done without medical indication.

                                population of mean age 3 years 7 months provides data on the outcome 
                                after forcible retraction." 
                              <P>The foreskin of 511 nursery school children was examined. Among 
                                the 500 unoperated children,"182 (36.4%) children had a history of 
                                forceful retraction.318 (63.6%) had no interferance. Of these 318, 
                                204 had a fully retractable prepuce (64.9%), 99 had adhesions (56 of 
                                little importance, 43 covering half of the glans)-(31.1%), and 13 had 
                                phimosis (4%). 
                              <P>The study does not tell us how many cases of phimosis which forceful 
                                retraction actually cured. 
                              <P>"it is possible that the definition of phimosis is not the same

                                of more than 500 New Zealand children studied ...at birth, 4 months, 
                                and annual intervals until the age of 8 years. 
                              <P>The aims of this research was twofold: (1) to examine the association

                                problems during early and middle childhood and (2) to adjust ... the 
                                potentially confounding effects of a number of social and perinatal 
                                factors.

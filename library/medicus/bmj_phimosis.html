        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>

                              <p LANG="de-DE"><strong>The  Value of Routinely Monitoring Boys for Phimosis Before Puberty </strong></p>
                              <p LANG="de-DE">131  word ABSTRACT </p>
                              <p LANG="de-DE">The  usual medical approach of monitoring and early prevention is of  particular relevance to the subject of foreskin conditions. After  monitoring and educating a group of boys for 7 years, Jacob &Oslash;ster  measured a 1% incidence of phimosis among adolescents. This is the  lowest incidence recorded in the available medical literature. It  appears an incidence of 1% can only be expected after 7 years  monitoring and education. Interviews and correspondence show that  young men with phimosis commonly experience embarrassment and  distress during puberty and in early relationships. Boys must be  monitored before puberty. Apart from allowing persistent problems to  be treated in good time, monitoring provides a very practical  education which will stimulatinge awareness and promote the simplest,  cheapest form of treatment: the self manipulation which will often  stretch a phimosis. </p>
                              
                              <p LANG="de-DE">848  word TEXT </p>
                              
                              <p LANG="de-DE">Our  culture's health care usually emphasises monitoring and early  prevention, except concerning the foreskin. Here, normal practice has  become obscured and even overwhelmed by the debate for or against  routine circumcision. It seems, routinely monitoring boys for  foreskin conditions, is a practice which was last urgently  recommended by Bokstr&ouml;m in 1944, (who measured an incidence of 4.1%  for phimosis among 20,361 army conscripts), and Sch&ouml;berlein in 1966,  (who measured 8.8% among 3,000 young men of 17 years old and over).  [1] </p>
                              
                              <p LANG="de-DE">In  1967 a revolutionary study showed that phimosis was not necessarily  an indication for circumcision. After seven years annual monitoring  and education of 1,968 schoolboys, Jacob &Oslash;ster [2] recorded phimosis  &quot;with a diminishing incidence throughout the years, from 8% in  6-7 year-olds to 1% in 16-17 year-olds.&quot; (If we include his  statistic for &quot;tight foreskin&quot; in the older group this  gives 2.4%). &Oslash;ster`s is the lowest recorded incidence for phimosis  among adolescents in a reliable statistical survey in the available  medical literature. Other studies record an incidence ranging between  3% and 14%. [1] </p>
                              
                              <p LANG="de-DE">It  is remarkable that since its publication, &Oslash;ster`s is the only  medical study whose statistics on phimosis among adolescents are ever  quoted, (in the familiar European languages). [3] &Oslash;ster wrote  &quot;Phimosis is seen to be uncommon in schoolboys, and the  indications for operation even rarer if the normal development of the  prepuce is patiently awaited.&quot; His conclusions on spontaneous  retraction are widely recognised. [3] </p>
                              
                              <p LANG="de-DE">It  is astounding that neither &Oslash;ster nor any subsequent writer has  pointed out a correlation between his low statistical measurement and  his seven years education and monitoring. It appears that an  incidence of 1% can only be expected after seven years monitoring and  education. </p>
                              
                              <p LANG="de-DE">Beauge  [4] reports that many young men with phimosis were helped by the  instruction which he gave on foreskin retraction. This stands to  reason, then young men with phimosis are often unaware of the  possibility of retraction. Whether this is simply because their  foreskin is impossible to retract or as a result of avoiding  potential pain or difficulty, the sufferer has grown used to himself  with the foreskin forward and does not possess the necessary  initiative to attempt a self regulation of the problem. It is clear  that education and monitoring stimulate awareness, and this promotes  the self manipulation which is often necessary to stretch a phimosis. </p>
                              
                              <p LANG="de-DE">Interviews  and correspondence concerning the sexual experience of young men with  phimosis [5] show the importance of early monitoring. Phimosis or an  inability to freely retract the foreskin, in its pathological form is  caused principally by either the phimotic ring and/or frenulum breve.  There are numerous degrees and combinations of frenular-phimotic  conditions each causing specific physiological effects, and because  these conditions are less elastic and do not stretch to the same  extent as the surrounding foreskin, the physiological effects become  more pronounced during erection.</p>
                              
                              <p LANG="de-DE">Some  conditions are infibulating, some are mildly irritating, others are  extremely painful. By definition all involve some restriction on the  freely retractable foreskin with inevitable behavioural limitations  during masturbation. After questioning several hundred 18 - 22 year  olds with phimosis, Beauge [4] described the truly &quot;conditioned&quot;  methods of masturbation used by men with phimotic ring. </p>
                              
                              <p LANG="de-DE">Beauge  added &quot;From the interviews it appears that the great majority of  these subjects are virgin, and that among those who have had sexual  experience, many have failed, with difficulty in penetration, pain  and loss of erection&quot;. Phimosis commonly causes embarrassment  and distress during puberty and in early relationships, inhibiting a  normal and healthy physical expression of natural desires and  emotions. This can become especially disturbing in those cases who  are not even aware of the possibility of retraction, due to a  displacement of the actual problem and the consequent disorientation.  [5] </p>
                              
                              <p LANG="de-DE">Clearly  there are far greater problems with phimosis than has been generally  recognised, however, when confronted at their origins, most complex  problems reveal a simple solution: in accordance with our cultures  usual modern principles of monitoring, education and early  prevention, boys must be monitored before puberty. </p>
                              
                              <p LANG="de-DE">In  order to monitor, with respect to the saying 'The fortunate foreskin  of an infant boy will usually be left well alone by everyone but its  owner', the boy himself must be asked to retract his own foreskin. If  response is not forthcoming or if the attempt is unsuccessful, it  would be exemplary of modern attitudes to first describe the  possibility of foreskin retraction and then give the boy a little  time to digest the idea before offering any further advice. This in  itself would be a big first step for many boys, showing due respect  for the youngster`s privacy, at the same time as demonstrating the  maturity of an enlightened culture to discuss such problems openly.</p>
                              
                              <p LANG="de-DE">Apart  from allowing persistent problems to be treated in good time before  puberty, routinely monitoring boys for foreskin conditions has  special value as an early preventative measure. Monitoring provides a  very practical form of education. This will not only dismiss the  possibility of boys growing up in ignorance, but also it will  stimulate the most natural (and cheapest) method of treatment: self  manipulation and stretching. </p>

        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P>Patients with erectile failure may have had the problem for many 
                                years prior to seeking and obtaining treatments. Such patients may 
                                also have had, yet be unaware of a mild but significant phimosis. The 
                                foreskin should always therefore be retracted prior to treatments being 
                                used. 
                              <P> In my experience, when instructing uncircumcised patients on the 
                                technique of self injection with vaso-active drugs, it is important 
                                for them to retract the foreskin and stretch the penis to one side 
                                while holding it by the glans. This gives a better view and therefore 
                                makes it easier to avoid trauma to veins and subsequent bruising. There 
                                is another reason. A 56-year-old uncircumcised man presented with complete 
                                erectile failure for 11 years. After discussion of treatment options 
                                he expressed the wish to consider a vacuum tumescence device. While 
                                demonstrating on him how to use such a device, he quickly developed 
                                a reasonable erection. The foreskin had not been retracted. He then 
                                suddenly declared some discomfort and the device became splattered 
                                with blood. On removal of the device it became apparent he had split 
                                a phimosis of which he had previously been unaware.

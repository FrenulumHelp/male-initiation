        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P>This study concerns 20,361 soldiers and reports 4.1% with phimosis: 
                                - I don't understand what degree of phimosis was measured, and don't 
                                know what other factors might be involved. This undeniably important 
                                study must be researched, if you understand Swedish, - please contact 
                                me - The English Abstract reads as follows:<BR>

                              <P>&quot;The author points out that medical literature unanimously 
                                recommends the correction of phimosis in childhood (<I>my note, he 
                                  was writing pre &Oslash;ster</I>) -- or anyway not later than the age 
                                of puberty -- in view of the troubles and complications frequently 
                                attending this condition. He gives the result of an investigation into 
                                the frequency of phimosis among the 1936 class of conscripts in the 
                                Swedish army, which proved to be 4.1 per cent of 20,361 men examined. 
                                An investigation of this condition among Board School children has 
                                led the author to demand effective control and treatment of it in the 
                                schools. Treatment should be undertaken not later than the 7th. school 
                                year. The desirability is also pointed out of the School Medical Officer's 
                                supplementing the sexual hygiene instruction of the teacher by demonstrating 
                                the retractability of the prepuce and by impressing the pupils with 
                                the importance of cleanliness to these parts.&quot;<BR>

                                There is no English abstract, --- from what I can read; "examined 405 
                                19 yr. olds" Tabel 1 says "Normala 94,3% Fimosis 5,0%" - later he says 
  "8 (2 percent) had already been treated for phimosis",  therefore his statistics are 2% already treated 2% healthy phimosis, 1%

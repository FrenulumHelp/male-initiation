        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                                Circumcision has been the traditional treatment for phimosis, but now 
                                is not the only management option, the best of which appears to be 
                                topical steroid application. Importantly, the literature suggests that 
                                phimosis probably is over-diagnosed, indicating that a prospective, 
                                randomized controlled study is needed to compare the non-circumcision 
                                options. Such a study would require consensus on the diagnostic criteria 
                                for phimosis; therefore, a more exacting definition would be needed 
                                and is suggested. Despite the non-controlled data on medical treatment 
                                of true phimosis, there seems little doubt that surgical intervention 
                                is not needed for all male infants with adherence of the foreskin to 
                                the glans, a non-retractable foreskin or, indeed, true phimosis. 
                              <P> ... circumcision is the oldest and most performed surgical procedure 
                                in the world. 
                              <P> The most common stated medical indication for circumcision is phimosis, 
                                however, the definition of this condition is obscure in most publications. 
                              <P><B>Defining Phimosis</B> <BR>
  &Oslash;ster found that the prepuce is retractable in ... 99% at 17 
                                years of age. (My Note: one of the repeated "misreadings" of &Oslash;ster:) 
                              <P> Little is known or written about the aetology of true phimosis, 
                                despite the supposed frequency varying from 4 to 10%. 
                              <P> In his text book in 1948 Winsbery-White defined phimosis as the 
                                congenital or acquired narrowing of the preputial opening, characterised 
                                by a non-retractable foreskin without adherence, which can lead to 
                                retention of secretions .. irritation .. balanitis .. interference 
                                with micturition ... pressure on the bladder, ureters and kidneys. 
                                (10) 
                              <P> A more precise and practical guide to the difference between a 
                                non-retractable and a phimotic foreskin is as follows, when the normal 
                                but non-retractable infant foreskin is examined, attempted gentle retraction 
                                results in the distal part of the foreskin pouting, and the narrow 
                                portion is proximal to the tip of the prepuce (Fig 1). Forced retraction 
                                of such a foreskin can result in splitting as is well demonstrated 
                                in the figures presented by Stenram et al. In contrast true phimosis 
                                produces a cone-shaped foreskin during the same gentle retraction manoeuvre, 
                                with a fibrotic, circular band that forms the most distal and narrowest 
                                part of the prepuce (Fig 2). 
                              <P> Confusion about the definition of true phimosis is highlighted 
                                by the study of Griffiths and Frank, who found that of 128 boys with 
                                a medical reason for referral to a paediatric urologist for circumcision, 
                                only 30 had true phimosis (although they did not give an exacting definition). 
                                (12) They suggested that ballooning and non-retracability is often 
                                over-interpreted, in some cases, the referring practitioner may have 
                                used the term "phimosis" to facilitate referral, thus further confusing 
                                the debate on the appropriate management of phimosis.

                                .... Steroid cream is a painless, less complicated and more economical 
                                alternative to circumcision for the treatment of phimosis. Wright had 
                                a success rate of 80% (89 of 111 boys) using a 0.05% betamethasone. 
                                Kikiros et al. reported an improvement in 33 of 42 boys (78%) with 
                                0.05% betamethasone, and in 18 of 21 boys (86%) with hydrocortisone, 
                                but they considered that the betamethasone worked more quickly. Another 
                                steroid cream, 0.05% clobetasol propionate, has also been used successfully 
                                by Jorgersen and Svensson. ........ 
                              <P> ..... Observed recurrence of phimosis after topical steroid treatment 
                                ... makes it important to commence retraction of the foreskin a number 
                                of times each day, once the phimosis has resolved. 
                              <P> <B>Summary</B><BR>
                                ... From the published results thus far 0.05% betamethasone appears 
                                to be more effective than 1% hydrocortisone. It would appear that regular 
                                retraction of the foreskin is necessary after initial success has been 
                                achieved ... However, a double-bind randomized control study of different 
                                steroids and placebo is needed to assess the relative effectiveness 
                                of each of the steroid options. Long-term follow up is needed to assess 
                                the recurrence risk, ...         </TD></TR></TABLE></TD>

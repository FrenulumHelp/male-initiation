        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P>I enclose extracts from medical studies .... at a brief read all 
                                the studies are on kids and stretchability rates differ considerably 
                                with children, at puberty and as adult --- big problem is that retraction 
                                was only measurable in the flaccid state --- very interesting is that 
                                no adhesions were found after this treatment leads me to wonder if 
                                steroids applied to outer foreskin could "heat up" and dissolve the 
                                epithelium ... the other good point on beta .05 is ... it seems there 
                                is no known bad side effect ... 
                              <P>As Dewan points out, phimosis is often used as a quite general term 
                                by doctors, --- I mean what should we make of comments like "Successful 
                                treatment depends upon the presence of a normal, supple foreskin at 
                                the outset," (Wright-JE) 
                              <P><B><A HREF="dewan.html#start">Dewan</A></B> makes an excellant definition 
                                of phimosis (in its ring form), and does a comparison of a number of 
                                previous studies - without actually getting his fingers messy himself 
                                ..- so it seems no-one has actually studied the effectiveness of beta05 
                                on phimotic rings ... these studies are all very recent we could be 
                                hopeful that Dewan`s conclusion-summaries be followed up ...

                                A prospective study of the efficacy of topical steroid in the treatment 
                                of childhood phimosis is reported. Boys referred to a paediatric surgical 
                                practice with pathological non-retractable foreskins were treated for 
                                at least 1 month with topical beta methasone cream. One hundred and 
                                thirty-nine patients were treated and 111 completed the study. A satisfactory 
                                result, defined as foreskin retractability appropriate for the boys' 
                                age, was achieved in 80% of patients. In 10% the response was inadequate 
                                at the end of the study period, but these boys were still under treatment 
                                or surveillance because their parents declined circumcision. In 10%, 
                                circumcision was performed because of failure of treatment. In six 
                                patients this was due to balanitis xerotica obliterans (lichen sclerosis 
                                et atrophicus) which does not respond to conservative treatment. Successful 
                                treatment depends upon the presence of a normal, supple foreskin at 
                                the outset, and on parental compliance.

                                The response of phimosis to local steroid application. <BR>
  <I>Pediatr Surg Int 1993; 8: 329-32. </I> <BR>
                                Local application of steroid ointment to the foreskin results in resolution 
                                of phimosis in the majority of cases, but if the foreskin has a circumferential 
                                white scar, it is slightly less likely to respond. Following cessation 
                                of steroids, phimosis re-develops in a proportion of patients. <BR>
                                The main current surgical indication for circumcision is phimosis, 
                                although recurrent balanitis and paraphimosis may be considered relative 
                                indications. .... Phimosis, which is defined as constriction of the 
                                preputial orifice so that it cannot be drawn back over the glans, ... <BR>
                                Thick fibrous scars of the prepuce appear to be more resilient to local 
                                steroids, .... It is possible that the daily gentle retraction of the 
                                foreskin to expose that part onto which the ointment is applied has 
                                contributed to the improved retractibility, but in an earlier unpublished 
                                study there was a significant difference between the application of 
                                steroids and the application of a placebo (non-steroid preparation).         </TD></TR></TABLE></TD>

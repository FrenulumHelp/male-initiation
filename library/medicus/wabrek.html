        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                                Dyspareunia--painful intercourse--is a common cause of sexual difficulty. 
                                The following paper discusses, for both males and females, the common 
                                causes of dyspareunia and in many instances the appropriate treatment. 
                                Painful intercourse for the male is related either to the prepuce, 
                                glans penis, penile shaft, testicles, or urethra and prostate gland, 
                                whereas painful intercourse for the female is related to the vaginal 
                                opening, clitoris, vagina, or uterus, tubes, and/or ovaries. Each of 
                                the above is discussed. 
                              <P>A common - and perhaps the most common - cause of sexual difficulties 
                                is dyspareunia, or painful intercourse. Although the term is applied 
                                most often to females, male dyspareunia is a very real entity, and 
                                both females' and males' dyspareunia need to be understood by sexual 
                                therapists. 
                              <P>A logical approach to diagnosing dyspareunia is anatomical, that 
                                is, focus in on that part of the anatomy, male or female, that could 
                                be causing painful intercourse. To meet that end, the present paper 
                                relates male dyspareunia to the following structures: (a) prepuce, 
                                (b) glans penis, (c) penile shaft, (d) testicles, and (e) urethra and 
                                prostate gland.

                                For reasons that relate primarily to sexual attitudes, many parents 
                                whose sons are not circumcised have inadequately stressed the importance 
                                of retracting the foreskin during bathing or during a shower. Oftentimes, 
                                the phrase "Wash it" or "Wash down there" may mean simply taking a 
                                wash-cloth and rubbing it rather quickly over the penis with no particular 
                                emphasis on retracting the foreskin and specifically cleaning the base 
                                of the glans penis. If this is not done, it is possible that smegma 
                                will accumulate beneath the foreskin. This can cause irritation of 
                                the glans penis which may in turn, become secondarily infected by either 
                                bacteria or fungi. The net result is to cause pain, and later some 
                                filmy or dense adhesions betwenn the glans penis and the foreskin which 
                                could certainly be responsible for pain during intercourse. 
                              <P>A second cause of male dyspareunia, also related to the foreskin, 
                                is phimosis. In this condition the foreskin cannot be retracted back 
                                over the glans, whereas in paraphimosis the foreskin cannot be pulled 
                                foreward over the glans. In cases of phimosis there is almost always 
                                infection present. There is an ideal setup for an infection - the area 
                                is moist, dark, warm, and bacteria are readily available. When the 
                                infection heals, scar tissue will form. During thrusting of the penis, 
                                this scar tissue will pull on either the foreskin or on the glans, 
                                causing pain. To cure phimosis, either a dorsal slit of the foreskin 
                                or a complete circumcision would be required. During one examination 
                                of a male patient, the foreskin did retract and there did not seem 
                                to be any difficulty, and yet later in counseling the patient stated 
                                that there was pain and tenderness of his foreskin during intercourse. 
                                Subsequent history revealed that his foreskin could be retracted over 
                                the flaccid penis but could not be retracted over the erect penis. 
                                During the physical examination, most males don't get an erection, 
                                so it is difficult to find out if the foreskin will retract over the 
                                erect glans; therefore, this must be elicitated by history. The teaching 
                                point is that just because the foreskin slides over the flaccid penis 
                                does not mean it is going to slide over the erect penis. 
                              <P>A tight frenulum can also cause dyspareunia. In the course of healing, 
                                scar tissue forms which shortens the frenulum even more and predisposes 
                                it to even more tearing and scarring, and a vicious cycle is set up.

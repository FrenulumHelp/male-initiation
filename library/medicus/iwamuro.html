        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P>BACKGROUND: No guideline exists on how to treat boy's phimosis. 
                                We examined if retraction of the foreskin of the newborn boy's penis 
                                could make true phimosis become false phimosis. 
                              <P>METHODS: We taught the mother to retract the foreskin and keep inside 
                                the foreskin clean. Exposure degree of glans by retraction of foreskin 
                                was defined in 7 grades, 0 (none) approximately III (middle) approximately 
                                VI (full). 
                              <P>RESULTS: Of the 538 newborn examined, none had full exposure (VI). 
                                All of the 372 cases who continued the procedure, including 2 buried 
                                penis, gained full exposure (VI). Average time for full exposure according 
                                to the first degree of exposure was 2.94 months (0), 1.78 months (III), 
                                1.22 months (V), 2.32 months average, respectively. No serious complications 
                                occurred. 
                              <P>CONCLUSION: Retraction of the foreskin from the newborn period made 
                                all the true phimosis to be false phimosis and operative procedures 
                                became unnecessary.<BR>         </TD></TR></TABLE></TD>

        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P>RS. Please note : I believe Betamethasone and Clobetasol Propionate 
                                are effective methods of treatment in a certain percentage of cases. 
                                My criticism of these studies is that parents should not be advised 
                                to experiment with steroids on children, until conclusive, scientific, 
                                unbiased, and uncontradictory studies have been performed, and the 
                                methods tried and tested, - preferably on adults. Individual adults 
                                or parents who ecstatically praise steroids as the new wonder cure 
                                will not change my attitude.</P>

                              <P> <B>Abstract</B>: PURPOSE: We evaluate whether steroid application 
                                alone or retraction and hygiene are responsible for successful results 
                                in boys treated with topical steroids for phimosis. MATERIALS AND 
                                METHODS: A prospective study was performed, which included a control 
                                group of 42 patients with phimosis seen at our outpatient department 
                                from January to June 1997. During that time we trained the parent 
                                to retract and clean the foreskin only. From July 1997 to June 1998 
                                topical steroid cream was prescribed in addition to retraction and 
                                hygiene in 276 boys with phimosis. All cases were divided into 3 
                                subgroups of asymptomatic, symptomatic and buried penis. RESULTS: 
                                The response rate was greater than 95% in patients who received topical 
                                steroid treatment in addition to improved hygiene. Only 13 boys (less 
                                than 5%) had no response to steroid treatment. Of the control patients 
                                23 (55%) had no response to gentle retraction and personal hygiene. 
                                There was a significant difference (p<0.001) in response rate between 
                                the study and control groups. However, the subgroup with a buried 
                                penis responded poorly to steroid, retraction and hygiene treatment. 
                                There was significant difference (p<0.001) in response rate between 
                                the buried penis and other steroid groups but no significant difference 
                                (p>0.05) in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Phimosis is a physiological 
                                condition in neonates due to natural adhesion between the foreskin 
                                and the glans. Chronic infection due to poor hygiene is responsible 
                                for most cases of childhood phimosis. Circumcision is the traditional 
                                treatment of choice for phimosis or unretractable foreskin, although 
                                it is not always desired by parents or surgeons. Topical steroid 
                                cream is an easy, safe and nonsurgical alternative for phimosis. 
                                However, boys with a buried penis are not good candidates for steroid 
                                treatment.</P>

                                treatment for phimosis. DESIGN: The costs of three treatment strategies 
                                for treating phimosis were evaluated using a decision-tree analysis. 
                                Three therapeutic approaches were considered: circumcision, preputial 
                                plasty (the use of plastic surgical techniques to enlarge the preputial 
                                opening without removing tissue), and topical therapy with steroids 
                                and nonsteroidal antiinflammatories. Published failure and complication 
                                rates were used to calculate the cost per case. Outcome Measures. 
                                Cost in dollars to treat each case of phimosis. RESULTS: Topical 
                                steroid therapy was the most cost-effective strategy, costing between 
                                $758 and $800 per case. Preputial plasty cost between $2515 and $2580 
                                per case. Circumcision cost between $3009 and $3241 per case. CONCLUSIONS: 
                                The most cost-effective management for treating phimosis is to initiate 
                                topical therapy. Daily external application from the tip of the foreskin 
                                to the glandis corona with betamethasone 0.05% cream for 4 to 6 weeks 
                                has been demonstrated to be very effective, resulting in a 75% savings 
                                compared with circumcision. Surgical intervention should not be considered 
                                until topical therapy has been given an adequate trial. When contemplating 
                                surgery, the lower morbidity, lower costs, and tissue preservation 
                                of preputial plasty may make it preferable. </P>

                              <P><B>Abstract</B> OBJECTIVES: From 1997 through 1998, we conducted 
                                a prospective study to evaluate the long-term outcome of using topical 
                                steroids in the treatment of childhood phimosis. METHODS: Both the 
                                parents and their children were instructed to apply 0.05% betamethasone 
                                cream topically twice a day for 1 month and to retract the prepuce 
                                after the fifth day of treatment. Results were evaluated at the end 
                                of the treatment and 6 months later. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-seven 
                                boys were evaluated. The median age was 5.4 years. At initial presentation, 
                                61 boys had a phimotic but retractable prepuce, 37 had a nonretractable 
                                phimotic ring, and 39 had a pinpoint opening. Patients with a history 
                                of previous forcible foreskin retractions were considered to have 
                                secondary phimosis. By 6 months following treatment, 90% (124 children) 
                                had an easily retractable prepuce without a phimotic ring. No differences 
                                were seen in the response rate between those with primary and secondary 
                                phimosis. In all cases, the treatment was well tolerated without 
                                local or systemic side effects. All the patients with persistent 
                                or recurrent phimosis were found to be noncompliant with the suggested 
                                daily foreskin care. CONCLUSIONS: Topical steroid for the treatment 
                                of phimosis is a safe, simple, and inexpensive procedure that avoids 
                                surgery and its associated risks. It is effective both in primary 
                                and in secondary phimosis. We emphasize the importance of proper 
                                and regular foreskin care and hypothesize on the mechanism of action 
                                of the steroids.</P>

  &quot;We strongly support the saying, "The fortunate foreskin of 
                                an infant boy will usually be left well alone by everyone but its 
                                owner&quot;,&quot;. If this is so, why did you treat these children 
                                twice a day? - This famous anti-circumcision saying strongly suggests 
                                a bias. </P>
                              <P>The abstract is so very convincing, however Im afraid I just cant 
                                accept that retraction, (with added vaseline), only works in 4 cases 
                                of 20. This is impossible unless we are referring to secondary phimotic 
                                ring. The inititial diagnosis of phimosis is very inexact, and it 
                                appears no histological examination for LSA etc. of the circumcised 
                                foreskins is offered, this histological examination is such an easy 
                                routine procedure that I feel a study which is meant to be taken 
                                seriously would not omit it.

                                with pathological, non-retractable foreskins diagnosed as phimosis. 
                                PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective study comprised two groups

                                were treated for 4 weeks and the retractability of the foreskin and 
                                any side-effects assessed. RESULTS: Good retraction of the foreskin 
                                was achieved in 19 patients treated with betamethasone cream and 
                                the response was unsatisfactory in 16 patients from the control group; 
                                these 16 boys and one 6-year-old boy treated with betamethasone were 
                                circumsized. There were no side-effects or problems after the application 
                                of either cream. CONCLUSION: Treatment with 0.05% betamethasone cream 
                                is a simple and safe method for the treatment of phimosis in boys 
                                older than 3 years. An early operation is necessary in cases of genuine 
                                phimosis when 1 month of treatment with topical steroids has failed. 
                                We strongly support the saying, "The fortunate foreskin of an infant 
                                boy will usually be left well alone by everyone but its owner&quot;. </P>

                              <P><B>Abstract</B>: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy 
                                of steroid application in the treatment of childhood phimosis. In 
                                a consecutive study 91 boys were treated with application of topical 
                                betamethason 0.05% cream twice daily. The foreskin was treated for 
                                one month, with an attempt at foreskin retraction after fourteen 
                                days. Treatment was controlled after one month and six months. Sixty 
                                boys achieved full retraction of the foreskin and nine had partial 
                                retraction and relief of symptoms. Twenty-two boys had unsatisfactory 
                                response and had an operation. Forty-five boys were controlled after 
                                six months, 13 had recurrence, of these nine were satisfied and free 
                                of symptoms, two had a new steroid treatment with full success, and 
                                two wanted a circumcision. A total of 74% did not need an operation 
                                after topical steroid treatment. No side-effects or complications 
                                were registered. Childhood phimosis can be successfully treated with 
                                steroid application, and the treatment should be offered prior to 
                                an operation. </P>

                              <P><B>Abstract</B>: PURPOSE: Circumcision has traditionally been regarded 
                                as primary therapy for persistent phimosis in boys. Recently groups 
                                in Europe and Australia have advocated the use of topical steroids 
                                as conservative treatment in children. We report our experience with 
                                this approach. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between July 1997 and February 
                                1998, 25 boys with a mean age of 8.3 years who presented to our clinic 
                                with phimosis were started on a topical steroid. After counseling 
                                the family regarding treatment options we prescribed a 1-month course 
                                of 0.05% betamethasone cream applied twice daily. RESULTS: Of the 
                                25 patients 24 completed the treatment and were evaluated. A total 
                                of 16 boys (67%) had a normal appearing foreskin that was easily 
                                retracted, while in the remaining 8 the outcome was unsuccessful 
                                and circumcision was scheduled. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates 
                                that the application of topical steroids is a viable alternative 
                                for treating phimosis in children. Appropriate candidates for this 
                                therapy include boys older than 3 years who have persistent phimosis 
                                and no evidence of infection. </P>

                              <P><B>Abstract</B>: The effectiveness of topical steroid application 
                                in relieving phimosis was studied in 41 boys treated with a potent 
                                steroid ointment. 35 patients showed improvement initially but in 
                                12 of them the phimosis recurred completely and in seven of them 
                                partly. There was significantly less recurrence in the patients who 
                                improved within one month. Most of the families were satisfied with 
                                the treatment. We recommend topical steroids as first treatment of 
                                choice for phimosis, when treatment is necessary. </P>                              </TD>

        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                            <P>Being in charge for over ten years of the routine examination of 
                              college freshmen as part of the preventive medicine programme of the 
                              university, I diagnose a significant number of phimoses among older 
                              children and young adults.</P>
                            <P>Among this male population aged 18 to 22, we have observed that 
                              nearly 10% have various degrees of tightness of the foreskin, ranging 
                              from total inability to expose the glans to a simple ring which gets 
                              stuck in the sulcus. In this report the word phimosis is used to mean 
                              the diameter of the inferior preputial ring is smaller than the diameter 
                              of the erect glans.</P>
                            <P>From the interviews it appears that the great majority of these 
                              subjects are virgin, and that among those who have had sexual experience, 
                              many have failed, with difficulty in penetration, pain and loss of 
                              erection; except perhaps in cases of the tightest phimoses who were 
                              successful in penile penetration with the glans covered. The remainder 
                              expose themselves to considerable risks of paraphimosis by persevering 
                              in intercourse. This possibility and the difficulties in carrying out 
                              successful intercourse make it necessary to intervene medically.</P>

                                <B>REFLECTIONS</B></P>
                            <P>The study of observed cases reveals that adolescent or young adult 
                              subjects suffering from phimosis have habits of masturbation different 
                              from others.</P>
                            <A NAME="normal"></A>
                            <P>Conventionally the pursuit of solitary pleasure is done with the 
                              dominant hand closed over the penis making alternate back and forth 
                              movement over the shaft, the hand going down towards the pubis, uncovering 
                              the glans which the index finger or thumb may now and then stroke lightly, 
                              reproducing the sensation of intercourse.</P>
                            <P>This exercise results in moving the penile skin in the same way 
                              as will occur in vaginal intercourse, and therefore it is a preparation 
                              for adult sexual relations. We shall see later that this training is 
                              not only mechanical, but also participates in the psychological development 
                              of the individual.</P>
                            <P>I have established a classification of the other methods of masturbation 
                              and have often seen them among patients with phimosis.</P>
                            <P>1 Some boys never masturbate! We may doubt their assertions, but 
                              the tightness of their phimosis suggests their statements are correct. 
                              Ejaculation takes place during sleep (nocturnal emissions), and more 
                              rarely spontaneously while awake prompted by stimulating events, among 
                              those subjects who attach guilt to contact with the penis.</P>
                            <P>2 Others stroke the glans through the foreskin in the usual way, 
                              but attempt to pull the skin towards the tip of the penis instead of 
                              pulling it back toward the pubis. We find among these boys the persistence 
                              of a long tubular foreskin such as is seen in infants.</P>
                            <P>3 In some cases the boy rolls the penis between two palms or between 
                              one hand and another surface such as the abdomen, the thigh, a table, 
                              the edge of a chair (in particular the toilet). It is usual in these 
                              cases for the raphe on the underside of the penis not to be in the 
                              midline but more or less displaced to one side or even spiral; the 
                              preputial orifice is often displaced: figure 1.</P>
                            <P>4 Mechanical stimulation without use of the hands is perhaps found 
                              most frequently (perhaps causing less guilt). In general, the boy, 
                              flat on his face on his bed, labours as if for intercourse with the 
                              help of his pelvic musculature, and rubs his penis against the mattress, 
                              the bolster or a pillow, often through a cover in which -- sign of 
                              the times-- he has placed a disposable paper tissue to avoid stains 
                              which would betray his activities to his mother.</P>
                            <P>5 Interfemoral stimulation is found, facilitated by a penis curved 
                              downward (figure 2), unless it is this activity which determines this 
                              anatomical anomaly. This technique has the advantage that it can be 
                              carried out in company, much as some females have orgasms by squeezing 
                              their thighs, while climbing a rope, or while riding a bicycle.</P>

                              6 Instrumental masturbation: this can be achieved by vibro-masseur 
                              or by showering, but it has never been demonstrated in this population 
                              studied and therefore must be rare or of occasional practice.</P>
                            <P>7 For the record: auto-fellation when mobility allows it.</P>

                            <P>I suspect that each condition and each combination of conditions 
                              leads to different methods of masturbation, depending on what is physically 
                              possible.</P>
                            <P>8 Inserting a finger between the foreskin and the glans is ocasionally 
                              reported among both frenulum and phimosis sufferers</P>
                            <P>9 Quelling the full erection is fairly often reported (to allow 
                              some mobility without crossing the pain threshold) Masturbating (with 
                              ejaculation) when flaccid is also occasionally practiced though this 
                              has also been reported from one circumcised and one uncircumcised man.<BR>
                              The Kinsey New Report report this among the old and infirm: &quot;The 
                              mechanisms governing erection, ejaculation, and orgasm are separate, 
                              so it is possible - and not uncommon - for a man to retain interest 
                              in sex and to ejaculate even though his penis is not erect. <A HREF="../xtras/refs.html#ref16">(16)</A>.</P>

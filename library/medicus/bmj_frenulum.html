        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>

                              <P><strong>The Importance of Monitoring Boys for Frenulum Breve</strong><BR>
                              by  R. Stuart</P>
                              <P><strong>Abstract<br>
                              </strong>This essay  discusses frenulum breve, literally the 'short bridle' of the  prepuce. During erection the tethering effect of a short frenulum  holds the foreskin in a forward position. Pain, bruising, tension, and  soreness are caused by the foreskin being pulled backwards, straining  and often ripping the very sensitive frenulum. This essay  demonstrates that frenulum breve must be monitored and corrected  before puberty.</p>
                              <P> Keywords: frenulum, phimosis,  male, initiation, monitor, prepuce, </p>
                              <P> <strong>Introduction</strong></p>
                              <P>Diderot  commented in 1779 that the frenulum meritted &quot;more attention on  behalf of doctors, who until present had not done this&quot; . In  1957 Grewel [1] spoke of &quot;a general or collective repression of  the phenomenon.&quot; Though he was referring principally to frenular  rips, modern medical literature [2,3] (<I>Pienkos, Whelan</I>) confirms that &quot;The  existence of a short frenulum is noted in few urological text books.&quot;  [3]</p>
                              <P>The  effects of frenulum breve are often misunderstood, recent  texts[3,8] suggesting it is the ventral curvature in the shaft of the  penis with the glans bent downwards which causes pain, While this is  a useful concept for diagnosis in the flaccid state it presents a  misleading picture of the erectile consequences. Men with this  condition do not normally hold their foreskins in the retracted  position, and upon release such a curvature is self correcting,  supporting the spring action which always returns the foreskin to the  forward position, thus they rarely experience any curvature.</p>
                              <P>The  male frenulum takes the form of a short prominent ridge anchored in  the &quot;V&quot; shape under the glans which joins the inner blade  of the prepuce dorsally to the glans penis. It can develop great  diversity in shape, thickness, and tensile strength and it can be so  short that it pins the foreskin to the glans directly under the  meatus. Depending on its length and nervous structure the frenulum  can stimulate considerable pain or pleasure.</p>
                              <P>Frenulum  breve is correctly described as a tether. The medical literature  speaks of a &quot;tethering effect&quot; [4,5] which &quot;tends to  pin and tie down the foreskin&quot;, [6]<em> </em>producing a slanting oblique  shape at the opening of the prepuce which makes retraction difficult.  [7] It appears the consequences during sexual activity have never  been further described. On attempted retraction the tethering effect  of frenulum breve returns the foreskin to its forward position, when  the foreskin is pulled backwards, this strains at the very sensitive  frenulum which will often rip, or cause pain, bruising, tension, or  soreness.</p>
                              <P>It  is worth noting that while the animals penis is considerably  different from the human penis the effects of &quot;persistent penile  frenulum&quot; are very similar. If the frenulum fails to rip in the  foetal stage, it causes erection curvature (as there is no foreskin  for the short frenulum to pull upon), or it can rip and bleed during  intercourse. [9,10] <strong>Remarkably, whereas statistical information on the condition among  humans is non-existant, statistics on the persistent frenulum among  animals are readily available (between 0.5% and 5.7%), [9,11,12] and  the condition is monitored as part of the Breeding Soundness  Examination. [11]</strong></p>
                              <P><strong>Methods  of Investigation</strong></p>
                              <P>In 1995 I conducted a series of interviews among an  unselected group of over a hundred men and fifty women. The sample  was between 18 and 80 yrs. old with an average age of 30, This  provided general information, an impression on frequency and valuable  insights into a variety of experiences.  Women often reported a different perspective - of a man who was  always flaccid during intercourse except during ejaculation when it  hurt him - and a young man who was obviously unaware of a cure for  his condition advising his girl friend to not touch the area.</p>
                              <P>The  increasing potential of the World Wide Web presented a unique  opportunity to research these issues among a large and widespread  population in the computer literate world, and since 1996 as manager  of the first internet site concerned with foreskin problems. Letter  exchanges with over 500 people revealed extra-ordinary coicidences -  a library contains a sample of the most interesting letters over the  first 4 years - two public forums recorded over 200 questions in the  last year.</p>
                              <P> The information and experiences were distilled and  recorded on the main html page &quot;Frenulum Breve&quot;, [13] - a  web of subsidiary files examine treatment, current attitudes and  comparison with phimotic ring.</p>
                              <P>On one added page I  collected the results of research through the entire available  literature on the frenulum from the Index Medicus between 1920 and  1967 and then from 1966 onwards the MEDLINE and DIMDI data banks.  [14] The Internet provided additional information from one quite  remarkable booklet on the traditional routine operation as performed  by the Luo of East Africa. This describes a variety of methods of  cutting the frenulum including the use of the local breed of soldier  ant, the Okoko, whose jaws grip and sever the frenulum. [26] Bryk the  anthropological expert on the &quot;foreskin complex&quot; was also  consulted, an incision of the frenulum was traditionally practised on  Tahiti and the Loyalty Islands. [27] </p>
                              <P><strong>Results</strong></p>
                              <P><strong>We can define 4 different  lengths of frenulum</strong></p>
                              <P><strong>extra  long:</strong> some men have a frenulum which is so long that during  masturbation they pull on it to acheive orgasm</p>
                              <P><strong>adequately long:</strong> some men  it is long enough to allow easy retraction with no feeling of tension  </p>
                              <P><strong>border line:</strong> some feel it pulling during intercourse among these some  complain of premature ejaculation whereas others feel without this  stimulation they would not ejaculate - this could be as much due to  length of the frenulum as individual psychology.</p>
                              <P><strong>frenulum breve:</strong> when it  is too short it will either rip or cause pain either during or after  intercourse - whether it rips or not probably depends more on the  thickness of the frenulum than its shortness.                              </p>
                              <P>Frenulum  breve makes retraction past a given area, uncomfortable or painful or  occasionally pleasurable. Youths will generally avoid any pain or  difficulty and adapt to a comfortable method of masturbation by  keeping the foreskin forward or at least not retracting it too far.  Though bruising is often reported after masturbation, when the  subject is able to control the position of his  own foreskin, pain or ripping are only very occasionally reported.  [1,16]</p>
                              <P>The  difficulties with frenulum breve typically become obvious during  intercourse due to the involuntary movement of the foreskin. At these  times when the foreskin is unable to retract further, it tugs on the  frenulum which then often rips or is painful.</p>
                              <p><strong>Ripping  occurs particularlv often during penetration [4.5] and often during  ejaculation. Rips are often reported during first intercourse [1,17]  and can bleed profusely [1,18] &quot;... causing a moment  of great alarm for both participants ... &quot; [17] or &quot;...  feelings of shame and self reproach [1] Sometimes these rins heal spontaneously. [7] but thev can also rip  and mend in a repeated  fashion, [7,19] on occasion rejoining and causing the frenulum to  become even shorter. [7]</strong></p>
                              <p>
                                <strong>Frenular  rips were reported far more often than a surgical correction, among  the 150 men questioned 6 cases of ripping and among 50 women reported  2 more cases - no surgical corrections in the initial sample group.  Most cases of ripping had not been reported to a doctor. This implies  that the frequency of frenular rips is probably underestimated. It  appears that there are many thinner frenulum types which rip  successfully with little pain; the tendency to rip, bleed profusely,  and rejoin, possibly occurs when the frenulum is thicker. The  continual process of ripping and rejoining results in doctors visit  and is not common.</strong></p>
                              <P><strong>Possibly  it is the more moderate degrees, the border line cases which cause  aches and bruising due to the strain of repeated pulling and  stretching, these hinder sexual activity for two or three days  afterwards. In addition, frenulum breve is recognised as leading to  premature ejaculation [21] though this again may be an uncommon  effect, but a primary reason for seeking  clinical opinion.</strong></p>
                              <P><strong> In conclusion, frenulum breve is  often combined with a relative or partial phimosis and this can  considerably complicate the anatomical and sexual effects.</strong></p>
                              <P><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
                              <p><strong>With  frenulum breve, as with phimosis, [17,22,23,24] at times the subjects  themselves are quite unaware of their condition. The restriction  lies hudden underneath the glans and behind theforeskin,  which is tethered in a forward position, therefore during erection  the subject must endure a certain amount of discomfort, and then turn  the erect member sidewards to reveal the nature of the problem - a  contortion which Houdini would have been proud of. Men frequently  complain of discomfort, tightness or pain, and show little awareness  of its cause. The perpetual recovering of the glans commonly results  in the impression of a &quot;redundant&quot; overlong prepuce. It is  probablv partly due to the elusive anatomical nature of this  condition that men &quot;will not dare confront the problem.&quot; [21]</strong></p>
                              <P>A  number of the men concerned believe that they are &quot;normal&quot;  and adapt their beliefs and behaviour to their anatomical  conditions.The subject accepts his condition and has adapted to it  since puberty (and probably to some extent since infancy). Feelings  of considerable disorientation are understandable <strong>Chitale suggests  &quot;1) bleeding after sexual intercourse; 2) tear of frenum ...  which does not heal easily; 3) ... pain after erection, and 4) all  the above conditions cause psychoneurotic problems.&quot; [8] There  is possibly no other group of problems which could be so easily  prevented.</strong></p>
                              <P>Surgery,  when necessary, is usually performed in early adulthood, one study  suggests an age range between 19 and 41 years old. [20] Most doctors  (possibly excepting those in the US and other countries practising  routine circumcision) are aware that circumcision is not an  appropriate operation to cure this condition, a frenuloplasty or  frenoplasty is usually recommended.</p>
                              <P><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
                              <P><strong>A  considerable proportion of the male population suffer from an  anatomical impediment which is reported to cause difficulty and  trauma by sexual activity. This commonly involves a shock for both  partners as the frenulum rips and bleeds during first intercourse.  Alternatively a neglected frenulum breve may cause years of repeated  ripping and mending, or pain and discomfort, during and after sexual  activity, and this may lead to considerable frustration and  disturbances in the sexual behaviour, before being operated in  adulthood.</strong></p>
                              <P>Frenulum  breve is an important reason why the early monitoring of such  conditions which inhibit the full movement of the prepuce be routine  practice. Steps should be taken to correct the condition before it  starts creating problems, rather than treating it after the problems  have arisen. Information on the subject appears desirable to include  in the school sexual education curriculum and would add an  enlightening chapter to many sexual advice books.</p>

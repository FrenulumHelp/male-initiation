        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P>RS. Please note : My criticism of these studies is that parents 
                                should not be advised to experiment with steroids on children, until 
                                conclusive, scientific, unbiased, and uncontradictory studies have 
                                been performed, and the methods tried and tested, - preferably on adults. 
                                Individual adults or parents who ecstatically praise steroids as the 
                                new wonder cure will not change my attitude.

                              <P> <B>ABSTRACT: Objective:</B> To assess whether it is the steroid 
                                alone or the gentle physical retraction combined with ointment that 
                                is responsible for the excellent results observed with topical steroid 
                                treatment of unretractable foreskin. <B>Design: </B>Prospective, randomised, 
                                double-blind study. <B>Setting:</B> University hospital, Sweden. Subjects: 
                                30 Boys randomised to be treated with clobetasol propionate (n = 15) 
                                or placebo (n = 15). <B>Interventions:</B> The boys were examined 1, 
                                2 and 6 months, respectively, after treatment. <B>Main Outcome Measures: </B>Comparison between the effects of clobetasol propionate and placebo. <B>Results: </B>Two patients in the steroid group and one in the placebo 
                                group withdrew from the study. 10 Boys in the steroid group showed 
                                an improvement within 2 months. The remaining 3 boys had no effect 
                                and were circumcised. Histopathological examination showed lichen sclerosus 
                                et atrophicus. Seven boys in the placebo group improved. The 7 non- 
                                responders were prescribed clobetasol propionate ointment, and all 
                                7 improved. <B>Conclusion:</B> 17 of 27 boys referred with "phimosis" 
                                were successfully treated with an ointment and gentle traction. When 
                                clobetasol propionate was given the non-responders success rate was 
                                increased to 24/27 (89%).

  " .. clobetasol propionate 0.05% (Dermovate, Glaxco UK). Instructions 
                                were to retract the foreskin as much as possible without causing pain 
                                and then apply a thin layer of the ointment into the prepuce from the 
                                corona gkandis to the distal margin once daily. After one week of treatment, 
                                gentle attempts to retract the foreskin should be made. <BR>
                                The problem remains, however, to differentiate and operate on the cases 
                                with lichen schlerosus et atrophicus, a distinct histopathological 
                                diagnosis which leads to fibrotic scarring of the distal prepuce with 
                                true phimosis, and which may develop into squamous cell carcinoma.<BR>
                                In recent years topical steroid ointments have been successfully used 
                                to treat phimosis. J&oslash;rgensen and Svensson reported a 70% rate 
                                of success using clobetasol propionate 0.05% cream, while Kirikos et. 
                                al. had an overall success rate of 81% with different regimens including 
                                betamethasone and hydrocortisone creams. However neither of these studies 
                                considered the possibility that the outcome was attributable to anything 
                                but the steroid."<BR>
                                The dilemma facing the family practitioner and the paediatrician is 
                                one of differential diagnosis, and identifying the cases of lichen 
                                sclerosus et atrophicus. The development of phimosis in previously 
                                retractable foreskin has been suggested as a criterion ... A good practice 
                                could be to circumcise patients with more than two recurrencese after 
                                treatment with topical steroid.<BR>
                                In conclusion, the non-invasive treatment of phimosis with an ointment 
                                and gentle traction resolves half the cases, and this increases to 
                                almost 90% with the addition of a potent topical steroid, thereby significantly 
                                reducing the "need" for circumcision.&quot; </P>

                              <P><B>Abstract</B>: BACKGROUND: Treatment with clobetasol propionate 
                                0.05% cream is effective against lichen sclerosus et atrophicus (LSA) 
                                of the vulva. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to retrospectively 
                                evaluate whether clinical and histologic responses to topical clobetasol 
                                can be accomplished in penile LSA. METHODS: A self-assessment questionnaire 
                                was obtained from 22 men with LSA, and a clinical examination was performed 
                                in 21 of them. Biopsy specimens from 15 cases were compared before 
                                and after treatment. RESULTS: Itching, burning, pain, dyspareunia, 
                                phimosis, and dysuria decreased significantly (P < .001 to .05) after 
                                1 to 2 daily applications, for a mean of 7.1 weeks (2-16 weeks). Additional 
                                operation for phimosis was required in 6 of the 22 men. All histologic 
                                LSA criteria were significantly (P < .01 to .05) reduced after treatment. 
                                CONCLUSION: Topical treatment of penile LSA with clobetasol propionate 
                                represents a safe and effective therapy with no risk of epidermal atrophy 
                                but with some potential for triggering latent infections, most importantly

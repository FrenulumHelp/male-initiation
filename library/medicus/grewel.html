        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P>It is a remarkable fact that the description of the surface anatomy 
                                of human individuals is not complete. An example is the frenum of the 
                                prepuce, the median fold of skin that passes from the urethral surface 
                                of the glans penis, behind the orificium urethrae externum to the deep 
                                surface of the prepuce. Exact inspection shows that at each side of 
                                the frenum a small fold can be seen between the radix of the prepuce 
                                and the proximal side of the corona glandis; in other words the prepuce 
                                is inserted on the under side of the corona, at both sides of the frenum. 
                                These folds are nameless; they may be called alae freni praeputii or 
                                plicae praeputii. At both sides of the frenum a niche is formed under 
                                these folds which may be named recessus freni praeputii. In this region 
                                the sebaceous glands of the prepuce are most clearly discernable 
                              <P>As a rule the alae freni praeputii are more developed or better 
                                discernable in younger than in older men. 
                              <P>My attention was drawn to this anatomical configuration because 
                                in the course of the years I have been consulted by men who mostly 
                                after their first coition, showed an excoriation, a slight rhagade 
                                or even a slight laceration of the frenum behind the margin of the 
                                corona, or of the alae freni. Sometimes it was not during the first 
                                coition that this phenomenon occurred but during a later one, that 
                                was experienced as much more complete or more satisfactory than the 
                                foregoing. In a single case the rhagade had developed during masturbation. 
                                These excoriations may occur more than once. 
                              <P>The phenomenon is not fully unknown, and general practitioners as 
                                well as dermatologists may be consulted for these rhagades, especially 
                                when a secondary inflammation complicates the picture ... The excoriation 
                                is seen in cases of forced coition in older men with a rigid frenum; 
                                a young man with phimosis developed a slight laceration in a forced 
                                trial to cohabitate. The occurrence of the phenomenon is mentioned 
                                in older textbooks of surgery and in textbooks of dermatology; in the 
                                most severe cases it may cause a serious bleeding and in rare cases 
                                a suture may be necessary. This must be a very rare occurrence indeed 
                                as the phenomenon is not mentioned in modern handbooks of urology and 
                                not even in a monograph on diseases of the penis 1). 
                              <P>Several questions arise. Probably the phenomenon is not so rare 
                                as one would presume, taking in account that practitioners seldom see 
                                it. It may be rather frequent or even ubiquitous. Does it occur in 
                                circumcised men? I have found no answer to the question. Does it occur 
                                in people who have never masturbated, the frenum being more rigid or 
                                less resilient than in men who practised masturbation? When it occurs 
                                in masturbation the excoriation seems to be localised especially in 
                                the alae freni. 
                              <P>Is the fact that the alae are more manifest in younger men than 
                                in older due to the constant stretching or elongation of these formations 
                                in the course of adult life? Elasticity of the frenum seems to prevent 
                                the laceration. <BR>
                                That anatomical conditions play a part in the causation of traumata 
                                durante coitu is shown by the occurrence of lacerations of the underside 
                                of the orificum urethrae externum in cases where the frenulum reaches 
                                that point. ...<BR>
                                <BR>
                                In view of the fact of the disruption of the anatomical continuity 
                                of the frenum during (the first) coition in some (or most?) human males, 
                                it is necessary to compare the embrology of the frenum with that of 
                                the female hymen. Embryologically the hymen develops from a fold at 
                                the point where the vaginal portion of the fused M&uuml;llerian tubes 
                                opens into the vestibulum vaginae. The frenum on the contrary is of 
                                ectodermal origin, the penis being derived from the genital eminence, 
                                as the clitoris is. 
                              <P>Therefore a similarity between the defloration of the female and 
                                erosion or laceration of the frenum of the prepuce does not depend 
                                on embryological identity. 
                              <P>It is as remarkable that a part of the surface anatomy of the man 
                                received no name, as that the phenomenon of the erosion or laceration 
                                of the frenum and its alae, though not unknown, receives so little 
                                attention, and is even manifestly neglected in medical literature. 
                                One is tempted to assume that psychological factors must play a part 
                                in both facts: not primarily prudery, but the castration complex of 
                                the physicians. 
                              <P>Prudery and anxiety on the part of the "patient" is an other, and 
                                probably an even stronger factor. A lesion of the penis during coition 
                                causes feelings of shame and self-reproach because of the supposed 
                                uncouth and aggressive behavior, resulting (in the opinion of the man) 
                                in an unheard of trauma; guilt feelings produce a resuscitation, the 
  "wound" itself a revival of the castration complex. 
                              <P>Men are manifestly proud of the penis (a fact insufficiently mentioned 
                                in the literature), not only during their development but during an 
                                important part of their adult life, men being as proud of this organ 
                                as women are of well formed breasts. When this important organ, this 
                                source of masculine pride, is menaced, fear and anxiety arise. The 
  "patients" are afraid to consult a doctor and await with tense fear 
                                the further development of the trauma. The speedy recovery allays their 
                                fears and may contribute to faith in the invulnerability and recuperative 
                                powers of this organ. But before this reassurance is reached their 
                                fear restrains them from consulting a physician and they are confronted 
                                with the patent possibility of castration. 
                              <P>As has already been mentioned, there must be a psychological reason 
                                for the fact that older men especially consult the physician concerning 
                                this lesion. The rigid frenum is not a remarkable coincidence, but 
                                merely the result of their neurosis, on account of which they have 
                                postponed the first coitus, and probably had little or no experience 
                                of masturbation. They are therefore seen by the psychiatrist as well. 
                                However, the fact that an apparently buoyant young man confided the 
                                secret of this trauma to me in his anxiety, demonstrates that he knew 
                                unconsciously that more than his penis was injured and that his castration 
                                complex was also. It is significant that he did not consult the family 
                                doctor but the psychiatrist. 
                              <P> In view of the great importance attached by the human male to his 
                                penis, it is surprising that so few young and older men consult the 
                                physician over these rhagades (an inquiry confirmed this opinion). 
                                It is probable that the normal man waits to see how the "disorder" 
                                develops; this does not mean that he does not ascribe any importance 
                                to it. It cannot therefore be the exaggerated importance some neurotics 
                                attach to the penis, which causes them to consult a physician after 
                                this excoriation. Only those who are haunted by a hypochondriacal fear 
                                or by panic are unable to adopt the philosophical attitude of the normal 
                                man. The shame and guilt feelings may be stronger than normal, and 
                                sudden revival of castration fear drives them to the physician. 
                              <P>The psychiatric aspect of this little known symptom, repressed as 
                                it has been by the medical profession itself, has never been mentioned. 
                                That excoriation of the frenum praeputii has also been neglected by 
                                psychiatrists and psychoanalysts is even more remarkable. The parallelism 
                                with the defloration of the female is too obvious to be ignored. 
                              <P> The psychodynamics of this repression on the part of the physicians 
                                is a striking phenomenon in itself. It cannot be masculine pride alone 
                                for this invulnerable organ and rejection of any comparison with feminine 
                                defloration which has caused the phenomenon to be neglected by male 
                                physicians and psychoanalysts, and caused it to be forgotten in dermatological 
                                literature. Probably rhagades of this anatomical region have caused 
                                a resuscitation, a revival of the castration complex in the life history 
                                of many physicians, resulting in a general or collective repression 
                                of the phenomenon. 
                              <P>The psychotherapist will do well to remember a symptom which may 
                                engender a real reactivation and actualization of castration fear.

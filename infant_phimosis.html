        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                                  <TD><P>A tightness at the end of the foreskin hinders retraction. There 
                                    are two typical forms of this tightness, an infant phimosis and

                                    and perfectly healthy. </P></TD>

An infant phimosis has an easily recognisable pouting nozzle which 
   looks like the shortened trunk of a miniature elephant. It has also 
   been likened to a bottle nose dolphin. 
                            <P>Normal healthy babies will freely and playfully pull the &quot;dolphin 
                              nose&quot; forward - this behaviour is reported as early as 7-9 
                              months - it appears to be a healthy and natural way for infants 
                              to release their epithelial adhesions. (see <A HREF="natures_way.html#start">report 
                                from a mother of two boys</A>). </P>
                            <P>I am dependant for more information on advice FROM parents. (I 
                              am not a father and I believe personal experience lies at the basis 
                              of understanding, so I am unqualified on this subject, and would 
                              very mush appreciate more reports from parents).</P>
                            <P>Many adults retain a degree of this long infant overhang. This is 
                              common and certainly not unhealthy and though some men choose to be 
                              circumcised due to a long overhang, this in my opinion, is not to be 
                              considered as a problem or confused with any malformation..</P>
                            <P>Occasionally and possibly only when other conditions are present, 
                              the tubular form of an infant phimosis remains undeveloped and tight 
                              even during erections in adulthood. 
                            <P>" ... I could get the smallest of my fingers down the 'tube', and 
                              under my foreskin to touch my glans. This lead to the discovery that 
                              I had a skinbridge.... I discovered this when I was about 25 and I 
                              was able to roll back the end of my foreskin - the tube. I guess that 
                              it had been stretched enough by then. It was like rolling down the 
                              neck of a polo neck sweater. My phimosis was - when limp, around 13 
                              mm in length. When erect this did shorten, but I could not ever see 
                              my glans." </P></TD>

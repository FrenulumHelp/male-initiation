        <P><FONT SIZE="2">The concept that an anatomical deficiency in the erection can influence the 
  sexuality appears to contradict every advance in understanding which our culture 
  has made over the last century. - Psychological research has concentrated on parental 
          and environmental phenomenon, and the urological disciplines do not 
          include sexual behaviour. Scientific research has overlooked this area 
          of human sexuality. </FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                            <BLOCKQUOTE>There are three stages in the development of the ignorance<BR>
                                <BR>
                                <B>i) The avoidance of sensations of pain from infant adhesions or pre-puberty 
                                  phimotic-frenular conditions; or a childhood trauma such as tugging 
                                  at the foreskin.<BR>
                      <BR>
                                  ii) Typically at puberty with active masturbation, an unavoidably conscious 
                                  experience of pain or restriction which may motivate treatment but 
                                  often will be repressed.<BR>
                      <BR>
                                  iii) Reinforced during adolescence and adulthood: The tendency to avoid 
                                  any sexual contact which may threaten the delusory sexual identity 
                                  and self-integrity. Becoming confirmed by repetition and established 
                                  in the same way as any other habit</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
                            <P>i) Among the many reasons for sexual disturbance taking root in 
                    childhood are the anatomical ones of painful experiences with epithelial 
                    adhesions, thereafter frenular or phimotic difficulties even previous 
                    to puberty. A boy is easily influenced and vulnerable, many are involved 
                    in a search for identity and feel consciously unsure about themselves 
                    and their bodies. Such semi-conscious pain acts as a deterrent, it 
                    certainly does not encourage comfort and a feeling of ease with one`s 
                    penis.</P>
                            <P>ii) These childhood complaints usually becomes active around puberty. 
                              Many youths are treated as a result of conscious pain during puberty 
                              or after first love. There are hundreds of different degrees and combinations 
                              of frenular-phimotic variations with minute differences each causing 
                              specific physical effects when erect.- All conditions cause some restriction 
                              on the free movement of the foreskin during erection. Some cause pain 
                              others are merely difficult or irritating, some cause obvious problems 
                              by masturbation others during intercourse, still others result in soreness 
                              after intercourse.</P>
                            <P>iii) Some men avoid the physical problems, psychologically accommodate 
                              the difficulties and recognise their foreskin condition first in adulthood. 
                              This self ignorance is based in childhood and puberty experiences and the lack of public information or discussion, the cultural taboo.                  
                            <P>The following discussion describes the psychological and behavioural development 
                              of these late initiates.

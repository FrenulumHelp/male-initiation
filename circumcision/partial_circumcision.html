        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. My concern is the early prevention of phimosis. The late correction of adult phimosis was never my interest. My belief is that once the medical profession realise the need, they will develop hundreds of new methods of treatment which I cant even imagine ... Therefore treatment  is  purely an appendix on this site, however, because I have no specific bias, my research allowed a rare objective survey of the many posibilities. </FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site offers  detailed information 
          on  individual problem related treatment, often advising simple, cheap, minimal and specific surgery and time honoured solutions taken from traditional methods including partial circumcision, dorsal slit and frenular incision and tying.

                              <P>Hi All</P>
                              <P>Thanks for the replies to my email.</P>
                              <P>I had a partial circ last Wednesday as a 'day case'<BR>
                                under general anaesthetic (yes a general is the norm<BR>
                                where I live!). The whole thing has been relatively<BR>
                                painless. I was nervous before the op but haven't<BR>
                                had to resort to any of the painkillers they sent me<BR>
                                home with.</P>
                              <P>That is except for my back! Apparently they tried to<BR>
                                give me a spinal block as part of the anaesthetic and<BR>
                                after trying 3 times they gave up. The day after the<BR>
                                op it felt like someone had kicked me real hard on<BR>
                                the tailbone and then by the 3rd day I could hardly<BR>
                                walk! I am seeing my GP later today to find out if<BR>
                                this is 'normal' or if there is something wrong.</P>
                              <P>As for the partial circ itself that was as I said<BR>
                                relatively painless. My foreskin was very swollen<BR>
                                after the op and 'black and blue' with bruising. It<BR>
                                looks like the cut was made so that more inner<BR>
                                foreskin was removed that outer foreskin and the 10<BR>
                                soluble stitches are just inside the 'new' foreskin. <BR>
                                The foreskin is still long enough that it just covers<BR>
                                the head of my penis. The only pain from my penis is<BR>
                                during nighttime erections when the stitches tend to<BR>
                                dig into the head of my penis. I really didn't know<BR>
                                that I got an erection so often during the night!!</P>
                              <P>It's now Monday the 5th day after the op and half of<BR>
                                the stitches have fallen out already. The swelling<BR>
                                has reduced considerably and the bruising is starting<BR>
                                to fade. I still have not retracted the foreskin<BR>
                                fully as it starts to be too painful when the<BR>
                                remaining stitches dig in. However I am confident<BR>
                                that it will retract once all the stitches have<BR>
                                fallen out.</P>
                              <P>I guess that brings you up to date. As I said thanks<BR>
                                for the emails and support before the op. I intend<BR>
                                to email again soon and let you know how things are<BR>
                                going when all the stitches are out.</P>
                              <P>Regards<BR>
                                Paul</P>
                              <P>Hi All</P>
                              <P>I had my check-up after the partial circ about a week<BR>
                                ago. To be honest unless you actually get past the<BR>
                                embarrassment factor for you and the doctor and talk<BR>
                                to them you are only going to get a text book circ.</P>
                              <P>After researching what could be done I found that I<BR>
                                could get a partial circ and that`s what I asked for.<BR>
                                Had I not educated myself as to what was available<BR>
                                it would have been the full monty and that would have<BR>
                                been it.</P>
                              <P>I am really pleased with the results - and all on the<BR>
                                NHS!! The junior doctor doing the final check was<BR>
                                more embarrassed than I was.</P>
                              <P>Hi All,</P>
                              <P>Well it is just over 2 weeks now since the Partial<BR>
                                Circumcision. The swelling has gone down, all the<BR>
                                stitches have fallen out (just) and the bruising is<BR>
                                fading.</P>
                              <P>I can now fully retract my foreskin when flaccid and<BR>
                                also when erect. However the scar is a little tight<BR>
                                when erect. There is also a lump in my inner<BR>
                                foreskin that has been there since the op. I can<BR>
                                only assume at this stage that it is some internal<BR>
                                stitches as that area was directly on the path of a<BR>
                                vein previously. The lump is slowly reducing in size<BR>
                                so I guess that it is just the stitches dissolving<BR>
                                internally. I would assume that once the lump has<BR>
                                gone completely it should be quite easy to fully<BR>
                                retract my foreskin when erect without the scar<BR>
                                forming too much of a phimotic ring. I have<BR>
                                carefully checked and it doesn't get stuck in the<BR>
                                paraphimosis position behind the glans when erect.</P>
                              <P>The finished result is very good and you would not<BR>
                                know that anything had been done when flaccid as<BR>
                                there is no scar visible. The foreskin falls forward<BR>
                                over the glans and it looks like I have a short<BR>
                                foreskin with only the very tip of the glans exposed.<BR>
                                When erect the scar is obvious at the moment but I<BR>
                                guess that it will fade with time. I am pleased with<BR>
                                the result and glad that I had the op done - just why<BR>
                                didn't I get it done earlier!!</P>
                              <P>From the whole experience I am grateful that I had<BR>
                                the support of everyone on the list. When I first<BR>
                                went to see the consultant (or rather his junior) he<BR>
                                told me that a partial was not possible and that<BR>
  "full circumcision is best" At the pre op check I<BR>
                                checked to see if I was in for a full or partial circ<BR>
                                and was relieved that it was down as a partial<BR>
                                (especially after talking to you guys). On the day<BR>
                                of the op I actually met the consultant who was doing<BR>
                                the op and had chance to tell him what I wanted. He<BR>
                                told me that it was no problem and that he would do<BR>
                                his best to keep as much foreskin as possible. That<BR>
                                was the most embarrassing part of the day in hospital<BR>
                                as you are on the bed in the ward talking to the<BR>
                                doctor with only a curtain around you knowing that<BR>
                                everyone else in the ward can hear exactly what you<BR>
                                are asking for!</P>
                              <P>Without the information on Robins web site I would<BR>
                                have not known what phimosis is and that there was an<BR>
                                alternative to a full circumcision. I would like to<BR>
                                say that the Internet does work and that there is<BR>
                                some very valuable resources hidden away in there<BR>
                                especially on "embarrassing" subjects.</P>
                              2 months later:<BR>
I am really pleased with the results.The lump that<BR>
I had described previously has completely gone (dont<BR>
think it was stitches).The scar is not a problem<BR>
and does not form any kind of phimotic ring.I have<BR>
not done any stretching and everything is working<BR>
just fine!
<P>When flaccid my foreskin covers the glans with an<BR>
  opening of about 1cm in diameter.When erect the<BR>
  foreskin tends to naturally just sit behind the glans<BR>
  and slides backwards and forwards easily.I have no<BR>
  problems to report and only wish that I had got it<BR>
  sorted out years ago.</P>

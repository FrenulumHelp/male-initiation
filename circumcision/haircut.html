        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. My concern is the early prevention of phimosis. The late correction of adult phimosis was never my interest. My belief is that once the medical profession realise the need, they will develop hundreds of new methods of treatment which I cant even imagine ... Therefore treatment  is  purely an appendix on this site, however, because I have no specific bias, my research allowed a rare objective survey of the many posibilities. </FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site offers  detailed information 
          on  individual problem related treatment, often advising simple, cheap, minimal and specific surgery and time honoured solutions taken from traditional methods including partial circumcision, dorsal slit and frenular incision and tying.

                              <P>For some men full circumcision is an attractive choice of treatment. 
                                For information on the full circumcision please visit <A HREF="http://www.circinfo.com/" TARGET="_blank">Vernon 
                                  Quaintance's pages.</A> The original routine Jewish practice involved 
                                only a <A HREF="../partial_circumcision.html#start">partial circumcision</A> and this is all that is required to cure phimosis in its typical 
                                form of a phimotic ring.</P>
                              <P>Parkash, (1980) suggests a very appropriate simple new operation 
                                involving exact surgery on the phimotic ring: &quot;An attempt is made 
                                to withdraw the thin outer skin of the prepuce to reveal the narrow 
                                lesion. The lesion is excised quite simply with a pair of fine tipped 
                                scissors.&quot;</P>

                                Re: Question regarding circumcision?<BR>
                                From: jfm</P>
                              <P>&gt; Could someone tell me how much skin is removed during this 
                                procedure? <BR>
  &gt; What is considered normal? How much is too much? (or too little?)</P>
                              <P>Contrary to what many believe (or are led to believe), circumcision 
                                does not<BR>
                                NECESSARILY remove all of the inner foreskin, nor the frenulum, and 
                                does not<BR>
                                NECESSARILY remove so much skin that the head remains always fully 
                                exposed.<BR>
  <BR>
                                Just like hair cuts, circumcision can be tailored to what is wanted 
                                (except perhaps when done on infant when the techniques used are more 
                                crude and predicting long term results on the grown adult next to impossible).</P>
                              <P>Just as you can go to a barber to request &quot;a hair cut&quot;, 
                                you can also go to a<BR>
                                hair stylist to request a particular type of hair style. In one case, 
                                you let the<BR>
                                barber decide what and how to do it, in the other, you are consulted 
                                into what you really want to be like. Of course, the skin system on 
                                the penis doesn't<BR>
  &quot;grow&quot; like hair, so the operation is more or less permanent 
                                :-) ;-)<BR>
  <BR>
                                So, how one defines a &quot;normal&quot; circumcision varies from culture 
                                to culture<BR>
                                and from individual to individual. Do you just want to have your long 
                                foreskin<BR>
                                shortened, or do you want to have an exposed head all the time ? Do 
                                you want to have some loose skin left during erection for masturbation, 
                                or do you prefer to have the tight skin to feel your erection and make 
                                the shaft skin more sensitive?</P>
                              <P>Is there a normal hair cut ? No, it depends on your taste. Is there 
                                a normal<BR>
                                circumcision ? No, it depends on your taste. Unfortunately, too many 
                                are not aware of their options and think that the only option is the 
                                removal of enough skin that none covers head when soft and that it 
                                results in it being tight when hard.</P>

                                I believe such basic information has never previously been publicly 
                                available and it is valuable reading material for anyone considering 
                                the operation.</P>
                              <P>Dr. G. Weiss offers invaluable advice on the after care involved 
                                in infant circumcisions; In &quot;Neonatal Circumcision&quot; the section

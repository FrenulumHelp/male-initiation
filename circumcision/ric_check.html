        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. My concern is the early prevention of phimosis. The late correction of adult phimosis was never my interest. My belief is that once the medical profession realise the need, they will develop hundreds of new methods of treatment which I cant even imagine ... Therefore treatment  is  purely an appendix on this site, however, because I have no specific bias, my research allowed a rare objective survey of the many posibilities. </FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site offers  detailed information 
          on  individual problem related treatment, often advising simple, cheap, minimal and specific surgery and time honoured solutions taken from traditional methods including partial circumcision, dorsal slit and frenular incision and tying.

                                and HOW TO CHECK CIRCUMCISED BOYS</B> </FONT>
                              <P>Some who have had this infant operation feel it is necessary to 
                                check circumcised boys as well as uncircumcised, however, none of the 
                                pro or anti circumcision sites cover the subject. 
                              <P>I feel I still do not know enough about the problems of a circumcised 
                                penis to be able to advise people on this...... and I would appreciate 
                                adults who have had problems as infant or adult, to inform me of the 
                                problems.                              </P>
                              <P>I hope the following will be helpful 
                              <P>Perhaps the first consideration is the pain of an often not anaesthetised 
                                operation, (which obviously a baby wont be consciously remembered, 
                                but babies are sensitive and they certainly experience this, and experiences 
                                form impressions and impressions develop into attitudes), so if you 
                                are determined that your baby has a routine infant circumcision, maybe 
                                you would like to ensure that the operator uses a local anaesthetic. 
                              <P>This operation is often performed carelessly, frequently by student 
                                doctors with no post operative check up - skin bridges are a common 
                                result. 
                              <P> The after effects of a burning soreness from a hyper sensitive 
                                glans for a few weeks are I believe ineviatable. Adult men commonly 
                                report a burning sensation from the newly exposed glans for the first 
                                month or two afterwards. Even with an expert operator or refined technique, 
                                one cannot avoid the resultant hyper sensitivity of the glans from 
                                a full circumcision when it has never previously been exposed.. 
                              <P>In this context, childhood circumcision is frequently reported to 
                                leave the glans desensitivised - and in such cases we may imagine the 
                                glans and the nervous system has over compensated, resulting in a a 
                                numbness of the glans. ... If this is true, it would indicate that 
                                after being circumcised the infant suffers considerable pain from his 
                                burning naked and wounded penis. 
                              <P>One could use an anaesthetic cream to protect the glans. An alternative 
                                (experiment) may be using oil of cloves, possibly diluted with olive 
                                oil - anything to protect 
                              <P><B>Post Circumcision Conditions</B>
                              <P>i) frequently <A HREF="../skinbridges.html#start">skin bridges</A> which can restrict or be painful on the erect penis<BR>
                                ii) occasionally: no foreskin is available for the tension of a frenulum 
                                breve to displace - and this causes tension and erection deviation <A HREF="../library/passages/post-circ-fren-breve.html#start">an e.mail letter 
                                  - </A><A HREF="../frenulum_studies2.html#kroovand">a medical report</A><BR>
                                iii) possibly: too much skin has been removed resulting in a tight 
                                erection.<BR>
                              <P><A HREF="../passages2.html#stoneage">Anthology of Examples</A> <BR>
                                iv) A newly exposed glans could occasionally develop allergies. 
                              <P><B>How to Check</B> <BR>
                                Though skin bridges and allergies could be diagnosed in the flaccid 
                                state, ii) and iii) would require the parent to use their eyes during 
                                their child`s bathtime erections.         </TD></TR></TABLE></TD>

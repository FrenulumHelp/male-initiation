        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. My concern is the early prevention of phimosis. The late correction of adult phimosis was never my interest. My belief is that once the medical profession realise the need, they will develop hundreds of new methods of treatment which I cant even imagine ... Therefore treatment  is  purely an appendix on this site, however, because I have no specific bias, my research allowed a rare objective survey of the many posibilities. </FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site offers  detailed information 
          on  individual problem related treatment, often advising simple, cheap, minimal and specific surgery and time honoured solutions taken from traditional methods including partial circumcision, dorsal slit and frenular incision and tying.

                              <P>If you wish to shorten the dorsal side of the foreskin by 1 inch, 
                                you will make a 1 inch incision, longitudinal from tip of foreskin 
                                towards base of penis. You then retract the skin fully. The &quot;scar/opening&quot; 
                                will be 2 inches long (longitudinal) because when you cut the 1 inch, 
                                you cut both the inner and outer surfaces of the skin covering glans.</P>
                              <P>Now, you grab both sides of the 2 inch opening at the middle point, 
                                and pull the sides apart. This eventually makes the points you gripped 
                                2 inches apart laterally, while the original 2 end points of the opening 
                                are now against each other halfway between your grab points.</P>

<P>This makes a much wider foreskin with a &quot;flap&quot; on the 
  ventral side which was not shortened while the dorsal side was shortened. 
  In my opinion, this makes aesthetically unpleasing results. However, 
  if only a minor nick is done (half an inch), the unevenness may not 
  be so noticeable.</P>
<P>As far as doing multiple nicks to even out the operation, you might 
  as well do a proper circumcision to remove just the right amount of 
  skin and get more aesthetic and easier to predict results. The more 
  nicks you remove, the more scars you will have and the more complications 
  are possible.</P>
<P>Please note that the additional &quot;nicks&quot; are needed at 
  the new end points of the scar (which used to be the middle points 
  of the vertical cut) otherwise there would be a small &quot;fold&quot; 
  of skin where the scar begin.</P>
<P>So, you end up with a 2 inch &quot;horizontal&quot; scar on the 
  dorsal side. The dorsal side is 1 inch shorter than the ventral side, 
  and the skin is 2 inches wider.</P>
<P>Over time, one would expect the skin to shrink some so that it would 
  not appear so wide and so uneven.</P>
<P>Of course, if you snip less than 1 inch, the unevenness will be 
  less noticeable.</P>
<P>Personally, I think that the conventional circumcision technique 
  yields more aesthetic results because it is more evenly cut and when 
  some foreskin is left, it &quot;fits&quot; the glans much better because 
  the skin isn't made to be too wide.<BR>

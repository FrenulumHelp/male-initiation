        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. My concern is the early prevention of phimosis. The late correction of adult phimosis was never my interest. My belief is that once the medical profession realise the need, they will develop hundreds of new methods of treatment which I cant even imagine ... Therefore treatment  is  purely an appendix on this site, however, because I have no specific bias, my research allowed a rare objective survey of the many posibilities. </FONT></P>

                                AS ADULT<BR>
                              </FONT></B></P>
                              <P>A few words of practical caution are necessary about adult operations 
                                on childhood conditions. When the glans has never previously been exposed, 
                                this obviously requires a different form of treatment to that used 
                                by adults who wish circumcision from free choice. 
                              <P>There is another danger which the patient must unfortunately be 
                                warned about. <BR>
                                Whereas with frenoplasty one can guarantee the operator will perform 
                                a cut which is worthy of modern surgical perfectionism, circumcision, 
                                is all too often performed thoughtlessly. Pro circumcision sources 
                                (i.e. those who are well informed about and positively inclined towards 
                                circumcision) recommend the "Tara Clamp" and other modern gadgets for 
                                performing circumcision as being safer and better cosmetically than 
                                a free hand cut. 
                              <P>Even with an expert operator or refined technique, one cannot avoid 
                                the resultant hyper sensitivity of the glans and the lack of mobility 
                                from a full circumcision. These are the practical reasons why a <A HREF="../partial_circumcision.html#start">partial 
                                  circumcision</A> or a minimal dorsal slit may be preferable. (without 
                                a competent operator dorsal slit is always preferable because of 
                                the minimal risk of mistakes). 
                              <P><B>Mobility and Lubrication</B><BR>
                                One very practical point is that a full circumcision leaves little 
                                mobility of the foreskin and thus a need for lubrication, this is common 
                                to full circumcision at any age. I asked a renowned pro-circumcision 
                                doctor about this.</P>
                              <P>>During intercourse it is the female that has much lubrication <BR>
  >provided when stimulated by the male. Since masturbation <BR>
  >is an "artificial" use of the organ then certainly substitute <BR>
  >lubricants might be expected to be used! </P>
                              <P>This is a very interesting answer, some may agree that little boys 
                                (and big ones) <I>shouldn't</I> masturbate, but it is undeniable that 
                                with our cultures present ideology that if something inhibits or restricts 
                                a boys natural inclinations then this is unhealthy - therefore this 
                                is in fact an argument against circumcision. </P>
                              <P><B>Hyper-Sensitivity of the Glans<BR>
                                </B>The most commonly reported ill effect of a late operation is a 
                                burning sensation from the newly exposed glans for the first month 
                                or two afterwards. This is normal, and unfortunately there is no recognised 
                                treatment for this, - men frequently ask (on the <A HREF="../contact.html#start">Forum</A>) 
                                how to relieve it. - one must specifically ask the operating doctor 
                                for an anaesthetic cream. An alternative (experiment) may be using 
                                oil of cloves, possibly diluted with olive oil 
                              <P>It is worth mentioning that childhood circumcision is frequently 
                                reported to leave the glans desensitivised - and in such cases we may 
                                imagine the glans and the nervous system has over compensated, resulting 
                                in a a numbness of the glans. ... If this is generally true, it would 
                                indicate the infant after being circumcised suffers considerable pain 
                                from his burning naked and wounded penis. 
                              <P><B>Allergies</B> <BR>
                                The newly exposed glans can occasionally develop allergies. One man 
                                had an allergy which lasted for three years after his late operation 
                                before he discovered a cure by wearing undyed cotton underpants. In 
                                the meantime he was first advised it was psychosomatic, and then was 
                                sent to specialists, where a small histological probe was taken from 
                                the glans. This left a sore point on the glans which still caused pain 
                                by sex some 15 years after the operation. 
                              <P>How is it possible for a sufferer to make a new start, when he is 
                                exposed to such side effects? Is this all necessary as part of being 
                                a man in the modern world? 
                              <P><B>Partial Circumcision</B><BR>
                                From <A HREF="../partial_circumcision.html#start">partial circumcision</A> the hyper sensitivity and need for lubrication will be minimalised. 
                                For the first ten days after the operation the stitches will be very 
                                uncomfortable as they dig in to the glans - in addition it will be 
                                advisable to retract or examine the scar every day to prevent skin 
                                bridges from forming. 
                              <P><B>Hard Lumps and Stiff Scars</B> Hard lumps are sometimes reported 
                                under the scar, presumably this is where the operator has tucked skin 
                                in, these lumps usually disappear within two weeks to two months. The 
                                scar may sometimes be uncomfortably hard and scratch against the glans. 
                                These factors must depend on stitching techniques and the thread used 
                                etc. This is usually hopefully only a beginners problem and after a 
                                few months any remaining hardness will usually soften up. - I have 
                                no more information on this. 
                              <P><B><A NAME="loose"></A>Loose Circumcision</B> Confusion exists with 
                                the terminology between loose circumcision and partial circumcision 
                                or "overhang removal". Both leave a similar cosmetic appearance, 
                                however with a loose circumcision the sensitive inner foreskin is 
                                removed and the outer skin is turned over facing the glans - This 
                                should be avoided because it may leave a hard scar line near the 
                                coronal ridge of the glans and probably even more disturbingly because 
                                the outer skin is facing the glans (imagine turning the bark of a 
                                tree inside out and the effect this has on the trees transpiration) 
                                ... it seems this can effect the personal smell with a need to change 
                                washing habits. 
                              <P>I would always advise that any adult who has never previously exposed 
                                the glans, first attempt stretching, creams, and then <B>at all costs</B> attempt to find a surgeon who will perform minimal surgery (a dorsal 
                                slit or partial circumcision). I feel it is essential for a successful 
                                operation that you find a doctor who truly understands why it is so 
                                necessary for him to perform an operation which leaves some protection 
                                for the previously unexposed glans. 
                              <P>From a dorsal slit, I have never heard and cant imagine any uncomfortable 
                                after effects, except that it is rumoured that this gives an unpleasing 
                                cosmetic effect. However this would largely ocurr only when the slit 
                                is excessively long, <A HREF="dorsal.html#start">a 
                                  minimal slit</A> is almost invisible.

        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. My concern is the early prevention of phimosis. The late correction of adult phimosis was never my interest. My belief is that once the medical profession realise the need, they will develop hundreds of new methods of treatment which I cant even imagine ... Therefore treatment  is  purely an appendix on this site, however, because I have no specific bias, my research allowed a rare objective survey of the many posibilities. </FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site offers  detailed information 
          on  individual problem related treatment, often advising simple, cheap, minimal and specific surgery and time honoured solutions taken from traditional methods including partial circumcision, dorsal slit and frenular incision and tying.

                              <P>Dorsal: top-side of the foreskin or penis<BR>
                                Ventral: bottom-side of the foreskin or penis</P>
                              <P>The typical phimotic ring is tightest at the front, near the tip 
                                of the foreskin on the upper side of the foreskin, thus a dorsal slit 
                                is needed to cure this. A slit ventrally would not relieve the restriction, 
                                simply because underneath the foreskin is not tight at the front.</P>
                              <P>There are two primary sorts of dorsal slit: -- the &quot;traditional&quot; 
                                cut through both the inner and outer foreskin; and modern plastic surgery 
                                on the inner foreskin: the simplest form of which is a long slit sewed 
                                together wide.</P>
                              <P>It is said that the dorsal slit leads to untidy results:- The traditional 
                                cut because of the flaps or the accumulation of surplus skin bunched 
                                up under the glans in the frenulum area.- The plastic method because 
                                the dorsal side of the foreskin becomes shorter, while the ventral 
                                side remains long.</P>
                              <P>However in these modern times, is there a conventional way which 
                                the foreskin &quot;should&quot; look? With present day individual expression 
                                and stylistic experiment, I would encourage young men to go and get 
                                their foreskin tattooed pierced sliced in strands and braided if this 
                                leads to a personally satisfying solution to the problem.</P>
                              <P>There are as many possible variations of dorsal slits as the imagination 
                                allows. <A HREF="../ancient_treatment.html#start">Ancient methods 
                                  of treatment</A> suggests various practical traditional ideas: cutting 
                                a V shape or why not a U or even a W shape which would leave a little 
                                pointed flap. Two slits could be made which would leave two flaps (or 
                                why not more?). The depth or amount of such cuts could be measured 
                                to cure the restriction.</P>
                              <P>The phimotic ring is dorsally typically around 15 mms. away from 
                                the tip of the foreskin. If we imagine a simple traditional slit 1 
                                cm. through the inner and outer foreskin, this would (theoretically) 
                                provide an extra width of around 1.60cms. More appropriate would be 
                                a slit only on the inner foreskin exactly through the band of rigid 
                                skin,. however such cuts must be around 30 to 40 mms. long and each 
                                would provide an extra 25 to 35 mms. width - therefore several of these 
                                little cuts would be necessary.</P>
                              <P>Houdelette suggests 4 or 5 mini slits in the inner foreskin to cure 
                                relative phimosis (i.e. a mild phimosis retractable when flaccid). 
                                With a full phimosis the operator would have difficulty getting at 
                                the hidden phimotic band and then so many mini-slits would be necessary 
                                that a simple &quot;traditional&quot; slit may be preferable.</P>
                              <P>On the one hand, methods of plastic surgery to relieve the phimotic 
                                ring are in their infancy and hardly any doctor is familiar with them. 
                                On the other hand even the most complex forms of plastic surgery on 
                                the foreskin uses simple techniques which every surgeon is experienced 
                                with. The end result is that such operations are comparatively simple. 
                                In the context of the complex forms of beauty and cosmetic surgery 
                                which are available these days, then such solutions have a place. The 
                                main problem I can envisage is finding the courage to consult a cosmetic 
                                surgeon and ask for any of these treatments.</P>

        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                                  It was never among my original intentions  to present a detailed anatomical 
                                  study. However I have heard a number of anatomical descriptions which 
                                  are concurrent with each other, and as such information is apparently 
                                  not publicly available, I would like to present my findings, in the 
                                  hope that an urologist or other men with these conditions will give 
                                  the feedback necessary to build an accurate basic description.</P>
                                <P>The current definitions of phimosis usually state that retraction 
                                  is not possible with the condition. It is significant that these definitions 
                                  stipulate what phimosis does (i.e. the symptoms), rather than what 
                                  it actually is.</P>
                                <P>Apart from the tubular form of an infant phimosis;- in children, 
                                  youths, adults, cases of ripping, infections, old age, (and even death!); 
                                  phimosis appears to have one principle form: a band or ring of connective 
                                  tissue.</P>
                                <P><B>THE NATURE OF ADULT PHIMOSIS: THE PHIMOTIC RING</B></P>
                                <P>It is medically understood that phimosis &quot;is&quot; or results 
                                  in a tight foreskin and doctors are generally aware that phimosis consists 
                                  of a band of connective tissue. This is probably such an ordinary bit 
                                  of tissue, that it is doubtful if any urologist <A NAME="hourglass"></A>has 
                                  ever examined it or studied the variations in case to case.                                </P>
                                <TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="10" CELLSPACING="0" WIDTH="100%">
                                  <TR>

                                    <TD WIDTH="80%"><P>This thin band or ring of connective tissue is embedded towards 
                                      the front of the inner foreskin and it narrows the opening of the foreskin.</P>
                                        <P>As phimosis effects the inner foreskin, it is practically impossible 
                                          for most men with this condition to retract their foreskin enough to 
                                          be able to examine it. With a relative phimosis, when lubricated, if 
                                          the foreskin can be retracted, the tightness becomes visible around 
                                          the shaft as a thin white band. Seen from above, this white band is 
                                          located around 10 to 15mms away from the join between inner and outer 
                                          foreskin. When the foreskin is retracted the ring produces an hourglass 
                                          appearance around the shaft.</P>
                                      <P>Drawing 1. shows an erectile degree of phimosis which is unnoticeable 
                                        when flaccid. The dark shadowed area indicates the outer foreskin. 
                                        (The foreskin is being held back to prevent the band from slipping 
                                        forwards).         </TD></TR></TABLE>
                                <P>The phimotic ring is apparently usually thickest on the top side. 
                                  However as it runs laterally, the band of connective tissue can become 
                                  thinner, and even occasionally divide in separate grooves.                                </P>

                                  believing that there has been very little research in this area .... 
                                  However a few studies throw some light on the subject. OJ Clemmensen defines the histology (the cellular structure) of 
                                  various types of this phimotic skin tissue and this leads to a new 
                                  understanding of appropriate treatment. Ironically Taylor provides the most accurate description of the position of the phimotic ring. </P>

        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                            <P>My findings are very similar to <A HREF="library/medicus/beauge.html#start">Dr. 
                              Beauge</A> who interviewed around 350 young men between 18 and 22 yrs. 
                              old with phimosis (defined as a preputial ring). "From the interviews 
                              it appears that the great majority of these subjects are virgin, and 
                              that among those who have had sexual experience, many have failed, 
                              with difficulty in penetration, pain and loss of erection; except perhaps 
                              in cases of the tightest phimoses who were successful in penile penetration 
                              with the glans covered. The remainder expose themselves to considerable 
                              risks of paraphimosis by persevering in intercourse."

that they were normal. One man who I spoke with, after describing how 
he washed under the foreskin with an extreme phimosis, (by flushing 
the area out with a squeezing action), told me he thought that &quot;everyone's 
normal, we're all just a bit different&quot;. (When asked about his 
sexual interests, he answered that the woman's pleasure was more important, 
it is a great sadness that for over 20 adult years he had had no intimate 
relationship. - I was the first person who he'd spoken with on the 
subject).

        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br>
  (2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                            <P>Paraphimosis (when the phimotic ring gets trapped behind the glans 
                              causing the glans to swell up) can be dangerous and is actually 
                              considered a medical emergency.
                            <P>&quot;I learned that if the skin wouldn't come forward, the thing 
                              to do was not to panic, but to slowly squeeze my glans and press 
                              the blood out of it till it got small enough for the tight bit of 
                              the skin to go over the rim. I just pressed it (the glans) gently 
                              with the fingers and thumbs of both hands, and the blood was slowly 
                              squeezed out. I'm sure any similar method would work.&quot; (<A HREF="library/passages/peter.html#start">e.mail 
                                extract from Peter S.)</A>
                            <P>Manually squeezing the glans with a relaxed attitude in most cases 
                              will subside the swelling. If after a couple of hours of trying 
                              with ample relaxed pauses - then it will be necessary to get help 
                              at the local emergency department.
                            <P>In hospital, paraphimosis will often be treated with a quick unecessary 
                              circumcision. Though some form of treatment is necessary, a minimal 
                              dorsal slit is all that is necessary and will always cure this condition. 
                            <P>I would always advise a small dorsal slit through the phimotic ring 
                              as soon as possible in a child, because the condition tends to recur. 
                              Afterwards, if necessary, further steps could be considered in all 
                              calm and composure.

  &quot;Treatment of paraphimosis is directed at relieving vascular 
                              obstruction by reducing the foreskin or releasing the offending 
                              tissue ring. Simple reduction of paraphimosis can usually be accomplished 
                              by firmly squeezing (compressing) the glans for 5 minutes to reduce 
                              the tissue edema and decrease the size of the glans. The skin can 
                              then be drawn forward over the glans. The compression of the edematous 
                              glans may be facilitated by slowly and tightly wrapping it with 
                              2 x 2 inch Kerlex bandage. This &quot;turban&quot; technique provides 
                              equal pressure around the glans and usually speeds up the process 
                              of reduction.&quot;</P>
                            <P>There are at least 50 references to paraphimosis in private letters,

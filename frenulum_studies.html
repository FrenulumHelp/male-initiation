        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              "Exact inspection shows that at each side of the frenum a small fold 
can be seen between the radix of the prepuce and the proximal side 
of the corona glandis ... These folds are nameless; they may be called 
alae freni praeputii ..."
<P>"It is as remarkable that a part of the surface anatomy of the man 
  received no name, as that the phenomenon of the erosion or laceration 
  of the frenum and its alae, though not unknown, receives so little 
  attention, and is even manifestly neglected in medical literature."</P>
<P>"The psychiatric aspect of this little known symptom, repressed 
  as it has been by the medical profession itself, has never been mentioned. 
  That excoriation of the frenum praeputii has also been neglected by 
  psychiatrists and psychoanalysts is even more remarkable."</P>
<P>"The psychodynamics of this repression on the part of the physicians 
  is a striking phenomenon in itself. It cannot be masculine pride alone 
  ... which has caused the phenomenon to be neglected by male physicians 
  and psychoanalysts, and caused it to be forgotten in dermatological 
  literature. ... resulting in a general or collective repression of 
  the phenomenon."</P>

"One is tempted to assume that psychological factors must play a part 
...: not primarily prudery, but the castration complex of the physicians."
<P>"Prudery and anxiety on the part of the "patient" is another, and 
  probably an even stronger factor. A lesion of the penis during coition 
  causes feelings of shame and self-reproach because of the supposed 
  uncouth and aggressive behavior, resulting (in the opinion of the man) 
  in an unheard of trauma; guilt feelings produce a resuscitation, the 
  "wound" itself a revival of the castration complex."</P>
<P> "... Men are manifestly proud of the penis ... When this important 
  organ, this source of masculine pride, is menaced, fear and anxiety 
  arise." </P>

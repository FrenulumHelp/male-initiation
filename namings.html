        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              of the Terminology concerning Circumcision</FONT><BR>
                          </CENTER>
                            <P>I always found it fascintaing that the eskimos have 5 different 
                              names for snow - they are so familiar with snow that they can distinguish 
                            5 diferent varieties.                            
                            <P> The sheer lack of terminology which exists regarding circumcision and phimosis is a clear sign of the taboo on this subject. The process of naming is a clear sign of cultural 
                              recognition. 
                            <P>The word phimotic ring was first recorded in 1994, previously there 
                              was no name for this common phenomenon. Some common experiences (like the frenulum ripping) are unnamed, 
                              some conditions (phimotic ring or adhesions) have no internationally 
                              recognised name, and if there is a name (circumcision, phimosis or 
                              adhesions) then you can bet it has at 
                              least two different meanings.</P>
                            <P>The word circumcision itself is used to refer to a variety of 
                              completely different male and female genital operations and anthropologists 
                              freely refer to dorsal slits and other genital operations as forms 
                              of male circumcision.<A HREF="library/xtras/refs.html#ref47">(47)</A>, <A HREF="library/xtras/refs.html#ref87">(87)</A>. </P>
                            <P>Medical attention is concentrated on infections in the genital area. 
                              Here there are two names LSA. BXO which refer to one infection. The degree of recognition which has developed for infections is illustrated by: <I>Balanitis chronica circumscripta plasmecellularis benigna</I>,... 
                              which is all the name of just one infection! </P>
                            <P>If we agree that the lack of clear namings is one of the symptoms 
                              of a taboo, then it follows, that as the namings get less clear we 
                              will arrive at the origin of the taboo: - and, to break the taboo, 
                              first we need clear namings.

                            <P><B>Phimosis</B><BR>
                              Phimosis comes from the Greek &quot;to muzzle&quot;. It is so often 
                              used today as a general term that it has become irrelevant for specific 
                              diagnosis or clear distinctions 
                            <P><B>INFANT PHIMOSIS</B><BR>
                              This general word <I>phimosis</I> seems appropriate for the non-pathological 
                              (not needing treatment) tubular form of an infant phimosis. 
                            <P><B>Adhesions</B> applies to many different complaints, mostly internal 
                              ones. Alone when referring to the penis, medical texts use the word 
                              adhesions in two different ways: skin bridges and epithelial adhesions. 
                            <P> <B>SKIN BRIDGES</B> (or<I> acrochordons</I>) <BR>
  &quot;True&quot; or &quot;acquired&quot; adhesions are colloquially 
                              called skin bridges or skin tags. The word "bridge" describes the appearance 
                              and so is the recommended term. (astounding that there is an internationally 
                              accepted specific latin name, only with this secondary condition : <I>acrochordons</I>)</P>
                            <P><B>EPITHELIAL ADHESIONS</B> (or <B>Infant Adhesions</B>)<BR>
                              On the other hand there are the so-called &quot;natural&quot; adhesions 
                              which refer to the sticky layer between the foreskin and glans of an 
                              infant. The term infant adhesions appears to be an appropriate colloquial 
                              term. - Campbell's Urology, (the urologists &quot;Bible&quot;), calls 
                              them <I>epithelial adhesions</I>. (Oxford dictionary: Epithelium: the 
                              tissue .... lining the alimentary canal and other hollow structures) 
                            <P><B>FRENULUM BREVE</B> <BR>
                              Most doctors call the frenulum or frenum simply "the band". "The short 
                              band" itself has no internationally accepted name. 
                            <P>German doctors call it "Frenulum Breve" and this seems to have good 
                              sense then: latin: - frenulum is the diminutive of frenum: a bridle, 
                              so frenulum indicates a small bridle: breve means short therefore Frenulum 
                              Breve describes perfectly when this small bridle is too short. 
                            <P><B>PHIMOTIC RING</B>. <A HREF="library/medicus/phimosis_xtra.html#ring"><BR>
                              This term was first used in 1994 (Cuckow) and is confirmed by Campbell's 
                              Urology (the urologists Bible) in 1998.</A> Apart from this, there 
                              is no word to describe this ring of gristly skin which is embedded 
                              just inside the opening of the inner foreskin. One could suggest the 
                              &quot;phimotic noose&quot; as this is more accurately the shape of 
                              this contour of skin. 
                            <P>Even with a partial or relative <I>phimosis</I> in the flaccid state, 
                              this phimotic ring can be <A HREF="diagnosis.html#finger">accurately 
                                diagnosed.</A>
                            <P>The terms primary and secondary are normal medical usage, natural 
                              and acquired are occasionally used. primary phimotic ring denotes a 
                              condition from birth, whereas an acquired or secondary phimotic ring 
                              has developed in the course of time. 
                            <HR NOSHADE>
                            <P><B>PLEASE AVOID using the term THE</B> <B>FRENAR BAND<BR>
                              </B>I beseach those interested in clarity and education to avoid using 
                              the word &quot;frenar band&quot;. The phimotic ring is referred to 
                              by hundreds of anti circumcision www sites as the frenar band. The 
                              word <I>frenar</I> can easily be confused with<I> frenulum</I>. 
                            <P>I believe if this had been planned to prolonge the chaos for doctors 
                              and patients for another twenty years, then it could not have been 
                              better planned. 
                            <P>Please confirm rather than confuse present usage even when using 
                              shortened colloquial terms: the term <B>ring</B> or <B>noose</B> is 
                              descriptive of the phimotic ring just as <B>band</B> is descriptive 
                              of the frenular band. 
                            <P>The invention of new words belongs to the ethos of many fanatical 
                              groups - I say again - Routine Infant Circumcision is abhorant, unfortunately 
                              those campaigning against RIC, motivated by self righteousness have 
                              become angry, fanatical and aginst all operations, it is ironical that 
                              now they are damaging their cause by developing and spreading new confusions.

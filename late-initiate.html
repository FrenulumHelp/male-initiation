        <P><FONT SIZE="2">The concept that an anatomical deficiency in the erection can influence the 
  sexuality appears to contradict every advance in understanding which our culture 
  has made over the last century. - Psychological research has concentrated on parental 
          and environmental phenomenon, and the urological disciplines do not 
          include sexual behaviour. Scientific research has overlooked this area 
          of human sexuality. </FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                                  It never ceases to astound and confuse people that I (and numerous 
                                  other men) have taken till adulthood and even fairly late in adulthood 
                                  to discover such a rudimentary ailment and inadequacy in his external 
                                  body. </P>
                                    <P>First, to answer the implication "weren`t you rather stupid?" 
                                      well yes!, - but I feel this question may also cause some embarrassment 
                                      among the doctors who have examined me over the years, the authors 
                                      of the sexual advice books which I read, and the therapists and even 
                                      experts in sexual research who I have consulted.         </TD></TR></TABLE>

</P>
                            <P>It often takes a long time for people to discover things about 
                              themselves, and this happens with lots of people in lots of different 
                              walks of life (even when there is adequate available information). 
                              Questions and doubts apparently occur with this subject because men 
                              are notoriously rumoured to be worried about their penis and every 
                              person on the street has understood that sexual problems are inevitably 
                              the result of early upbringing, parents and a resultant psychological 
                              deficiency.                 
                            <P>Any anatomical problems of the penis are generally understood to 
                              be illusory. Even the unbiased listener if they understand that men 
                              do indeed have anatomical complaints, they reason with accepted modern 
                              awareness that some sort of psychological imbalance must have been 
                              the primary influence which allowed the anatomical disposition to become 
                              a problem. - This is not the case. 
                            <P>It is necessary to correct these misunderstandings, and analyse 
                              and describe this aspect of human nature.

          male circumcision. Most of the literature shows no awareness 
          of phimosis - its frequency - or the sexual and erectile problems which can be cured by circumcision. If routine circumcision 
          had been introduced for this most obvious reason of eliminating difficult 
          foreskins; then the importance of an alternative modern method, suitable to our culture's attitudes in this day and age, would be clear. </FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                            <P>   What are the origins of the practice of routine circumcision?                            
                            <P>The existing anthropological and psychological explanations  suggest the introduction and continuation   were due to the same reason, as though the practice were in a state of continuous re-creation <B>:</B> Theories range between a manifestation of cultural   requirements (e.g. hygiene, initiation, fertility, tribal mark, sexual   advantages) or the expression of unconscious tendencies (e.g. castration   complex, menstruation envy, regression). All the theories given (except Ploss and Bryk) are   devoid of any dynamic impulse which could have provoked the operation.   
                            <P>Conversly, the removal of foreskin conditions would be excluded   from any answer relating to continuation ; then logically   once the foreskin had been removed, men would no longer experience   the need to remove it.                            </P>

                                  <P><FONT SIZE="3">Bryk </FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> argues that phimosis would have led to the first operations: &quot;</FONT>There 
    can be no doubt that even in the dark beginnings of time, surgical 
    interventions were carried out on the foreskin on medical grounds, 
    then it is certain even in those times, that congenital phimosis occurred 
    ... or the opening of the foreskin 
    was so narrow, that the prepuce could never be retracted behind the 
    glans.&quot; I suggest the first isolated operations would have been among those individuals 
                                    who had consciously painful or difficult, 
                                  conditions, infections or injuries.</P>
                                  <P>This was a practical step. Once early man had discovered the usefullness 
                              of bamboo splinters or sharp flint stones for cutting skin, (which 
                              would have been a primary association due to cutting up animals for 
                              food ) primitive surgery became possible. When one considers the ease of cutting skin, one can appreciate how early 
                              in surgical history such a step would have been apparent to our pre-literate 
                              man to ammend the involuntary, annoying and often painful sexual difficulties 
                              inherent in phimosis.<BR>

                                  <TD>Such a step would be especially obvious to someone of adult age 
                                    with an infection, or one of the secondary conditions. Here the sufferer is vividly 
                                    aware of the newly developed encumbrance (possibly feeling frustration 
                                    or anger or even fear); in contrast to men with congenital conditions 
                                    he is aware of how the foreskin normally functions he knows the foreskin 
                                    folds back revealing the glans; he would realise that he must simply pull the foreskin forward 
                                    and cut off to resolve his irritating involuntary pain or difficulty.         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                            For some men with phimosis, circumcision is a very obvious step. 
                              There are a number of examples of men circumcising themselves even 
                              in modern times. Throughout history this operation has undoubtedly 
                              been self performed by countless individuals. 
                            <P>Performing this operation on a second person e.g. parents circumcising 
                              their children, requires a more developed association of thoughts, 
                              and therefore must have developed later.

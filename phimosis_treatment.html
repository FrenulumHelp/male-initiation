        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. My concern is the early prevention of phimosis. The late correction of adult phimosis was never my interest. My belief is that once the medical profession realise the need, they will develop hundreds of new methods of treatment which I cant even imagine ... Therefore treatment  is  purely an appendix on this site, however, because I have no specific bias, my research allowed a rare objective survey of the many posibilities. </FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site offers  detailed information 
          on  individual problem related treatment, often advising simple, cheap, minimal and specific surgery and time honoured solutions taken from traditional methods including partial circumcision, dorsal slit and frenular incision and tying.

                                        is suggested: </P>
                                    <P>1) If the subject has a primary or congenital phimosis, i.e. ever 
                                      since he can remember, then there is every reason to believe that gentle 
                                      stretching will mobilise the elastic capacity of the skin tissue.</P>
                                    <P>2) If on the other hand he can remember the phimotic ring developing 
                                      then it is most probably a secondary phimosis of a lichenoid or fibrous 
                                      type, such types are atrophic (prone to degeneration), they will generally 
                                      be difficult to stretch. Clobetasol Propionate and other steroids may 
                                      help, but recurrent problems require surgery.         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                            <P>Circumcision remains largely unquestioned as the treatment for phimosis. 
                              Circumcision is the oldest routine operation. This operation is the 
                              foundation stone of surgical history and its tradition in Western medicine. 
                              However, in the modern world a full circumcision is usually performed, 
                              whereas the origional traditional operation was a partial circumcision 
                              or dorsal slit, and these are usually fully sufficient and effective 
                              treatments.</P>
                            <P>I believe <A HREF="phimosis_studies.html#start">Clemmensen's study</A> is a revolutionary step in the history of the treatment of phimosis,

                              Stretching is an effective treatment for primary &quot;simple&quot; 
                              phimosis. This must be understood as a temporary measure, however 
                              the daily stretching may become an enjoyable pastime and it becomes 
                              easier to stretch. Various methods are reported. Please see <A HREF="stretching.html#start">Stretching</A> - Please note, for children stretching exercises and experiments 
                              with creams and steroids can be far more disturbing than surgery.

                              The use of Kenalog, Betamethasone and Clobetasol Propionate are 
                              recently reported to have considerable success - even without stretching.

                              For some men full circumcision is an attractive choice of treatment. 
                              A full circumcision is also the least problematic form of treatment 
                              simply because it is easily available and doctors are familiar and 
                              experienced with a number of successful methods. For the treatment 
                              of a phimotic ring a <A HREF="partial_circumcision.html#start">partial

                              Infections develop easily in the humid almost subtropical preputial 
                              zones and require dry surroundings to heal. The only safe recommendation 
                              if an infection has developed is to recommend a full circumcision. 
                              Cleanliness and regularly wearing the foreskin retracted are probably 
                              the simplest methods of preventing lichenoid conditions from developing 
                              in the first place. <BR>

                              misinterpreted, exaggerated and widely accepted. Boys and men often 
                              report that they were advised to wait and see what happens. This most 
                              useless piece of information was even given to my father at the age 
                              of 76. - (&Oslash;ster checked and educated his boys every year for 
                              7 years - His study does not show the effects of "normal development" 
                              it shows the effects of checking and educating for 7 yrs!)</P>

                              </B> Boys who are consciously aware of difficulty by retraction often 
                              want a circumcision, (and they are often dissuaded). If a boy wants 
                              a circumcision then he should certainly have it - even if his phimosis 
                              could be treated with less severe measures. On the other hand with <B>late operations on childhood conditions</B> where the glans has 
                              never previously been exposed, men can be extremely disturbed about 
                              the idea of losing the foreskin, simply because it is all they`ve ever 
                              seen or identified with their manhood. <A HREF="library/surround/perspectives.html#start">(more 
                                on different perspectives).</A> and they do not realise that there 
                              is any other cure except circumcision.</P>
                            <P>A word of practical caution is also necessary about adult operations. <A HREF="circumcision/post_circumcision.html#start">Adult post circ.

Much modern medical information on circumcision (from popular literature to reports in medical journals), recommends that the best care for a foreskin is to leave it alone. These reports are all based on &Oslash;ster's misinterpreted study. &Oslash;ster made his report following 7 years of education and monitoring. Such care and attention obviously results in less problems.</FONT></P></TD>

                                <P>The male discovers his first erections, as an infant. (something 
                                  that astounded me the first time I saw my baby with one at about 9 
                                  days old.).</P>
                                <P>These infant erections are not necessarily in conjunction with a 
                                  full bladder. There have been times where they have JUST voided their 
                                  bladder and voila! a few minutes later...an erection. Nothing about 
                                  their foreskin has ever impeded their ability to get an erection.</P>
                                <P>My understanding is that it is the *forward* pulling of the foreskin 
                                  that aids in the natural separation of foreskin from the glans. Releasing 
                                  the adhesions by pulling *forward* helps the overall elasticity of 
                                  the foreskin, it does not change the length of the foreskin.</P>
                                <P>My pediatrician had told me that pulling the foreskin forward gently 
                                  during diapering, and/or alternating that with taking the foreskin 
                                  between thumb and finger and &quot;rolling it&quot; back an forth (like 
                                  if you had a pencil and were rolling it between your fingers) and also 
                                  gently pulling the foreskin forward in a sort of very gentle milking 
                                  action, would help in the natural separation. Once the boys discovered 
                                  this themselves, self manipulation would do the trick. Masturbation 
                                  or manipulation in this way is nature's way of providing the safest 
                                  (and most pleasurable) way of separating the foreskin from the glans. 
                                  So...slapping the hands away is a detriment. That is why there is nothing 
  &quot;evil&quot; about masturbation. It's natural. It feels good.</P>
                                <P>If memory serves, it was at about 7 - 9 months when either of my 
                                  sons actually would consciously &quot;handle&quot; their penises. During 
                                  toddler stages, both of my boys would gleefully say, &quot;Hey Mommy! 
                                  Lookit what I kin do!&quot; and I'd look and they'd pull their foreskins 
                                  practically to their knees! [that's what it looked like anyway] While 
                                  I would wince thinking at first, &quot;Gads! Doesn't that hurt??&quot;, 
                                  their looks of sheer pleasure assured me otherwise.</P>
                                <P>During bathing, they were instructed to pull back &quot;only as 
                                  far as it would go&quot;. This was also done by me while diapering. 
                                  At first, that meant nothing really happened at all. Meaning that the 
                                  glans was never even seen. Slowly...that changes and the foreskin widens 
                                  and you start to see the glans crown. As soon as you start teaching 
                                  the child to wash himself, you can teach him to wash himself &quot;down 
                                  there&quot; by just saying, &quot;Ok...gently pull the skin back, wash, 
                                  rinse. OK! You're done!&quot;</P>
                                <P>Then one day, while they are retracting as they've always done, 
                                  the glans seems to &quot;pop&quot; out. This happened when I was still 
                                  supervising their bathing so I saw it happen. No pain was experienced.</P>
                                <P>I've asked to check to see if they can &quot;make the head come 
                                  out all the way&quot;. So...they show me. Sometimes I ask after noticing 
                                  that they are erect. In either case, with both boys, the foreskin glides 
                                  freely and easily over the glans. I do notice on my 8 year old, that 
                                  the foreskin isn't *completely* off the &quot;edge/rim&quot; of the 
                                  glans. That is to say, that in most areas around the rim/edge of the 
                                  glans, the foreskin is completely off the glans. A small portion is 
                                  still &quot;stuck&quot; on the glans. I have told him, &quot;Ok...see 
                                  this part here? It's not completely off like it is on this side. You 
                                  need to help it to come off very carefully by pulling on it a little 
                                  bit...but always gently. Never do it if it hurts. Also...continue to 
                                  pull forward to help it that way, too.&quot; He's fine with the instructions...and 
                                  I have seen progress.</P>
                                <P>They most often obtain erections by manipulation of the foreskin 
                                  only...but not always. Sometimes they stroke the shaft; sometimes they 
                                  only tug/twirl their foreskins. Once they are erect, the foreskin still 
                                  glides freely over the glans...fully exposing the glans. Nature provided 
                                  pleasure during such manipulation as a *natural* avenue to aid in the 
                                  separation of the foreskin from the glans.</P>
                                <P><B>Little boys, erections and self manipulation is NORMAL, NATURAL 
                                  and NECESSARY.</B></P>                                </TD>

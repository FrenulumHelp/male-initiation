Much modern medical information on circumcision (from popular literature to reports in medical journals), recommends that the best care for a foreskin is to leave it alone. These reports are all based on &Oslash;ster's misinterpreted study. &Oslash;ster made his report following 7 years of education and monitoring. Such care and attention obviously results in less problems.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                                        during infancy&quot; <A HREF="library/xtras/refs.html#ref22">(22)</A> - This check is very easy to perform: During bath time erections 
                                        - Simply look : Is the foreskin moving freely? - If so your child

                                        If parents made an early check on a boy's erect penis, this would be 
                                        far more effective and efficient than a doctor's check on the boy's 
                                        flaccid penis. </P></TD>

                            <P><B>After reading the <A HREF="phimosis.html#start">Summary 
of The Conditions</A>, if parents wish to, they could easily diagnose 
most problems. While it is not essential for parents to do this, I

                              The phimotic ring is by nature less elastic than the surrounding 
                              foreskin; a foreskin which can be easily retracted when flaccid 
                              can easily cause pain during erections; therefore the only complete 
                              way of checking a boy for potentially sexually difficult conditions 
                              is when the penis is erect. 
                            <P>This is easy for parents to observe during bath times, and simple 
                              observation is all this check requires; at most the child could be 
                              asked if he can retract his own foreskin, if at some point this becomes 
                              necessary.</P>
                            <P>As the pouting nozzle of an infants foreskin starts to open up, 
                              which can be anytime between birth and 5 yrs. old there will often 
                              be a few harmless remnants of the adhesive bond between the foreskin 
                              and glans. These should not be forced in anyway and detailed reading 
                              of <A HREF="natures_way.html#start">Natures Way</A> and the following 
                              pages, is advised if you wish to encourage these to release. 
                            <P>The common problem conditions are phimotic ring, frenulum breve 
                              and skin bridges. 
                            <P><B>Phimotic ring</B><BR>
                              When checking for problems, first, if there is a phimotic ring this 
                              will often be thickest and most easily visible on the top side where 
                              it is near the end of the inner foreskin. On attempted gentle retraction, 
                              the outer skin will fold over a little, and only a small strip of the 
                              inner foreskin will be visible and maybe even a fine pencil line of 
                              this white band of &quot;gristle&quot;. </P>
                            <P>The majority of these infant rings are soft rings which <A HREF="prevention.html#start">will 
                              stretch</A>.(especially with the help of <A HREF="steroids.html#start"> steroids</A>)</P>
                            <P><B>Skin bridges and Short frenulum </B><BR>
                              If the infant adhesions were previously broken and the raw sticky skin 
                              surfaces allowed to rest together again, they may have left little 
                              skin-bridges anywhere between the foreskin and the glans.</P>
                            <P>Though the frenulum breve can be checked when flaccid, it is most 
                              obvious during erection when it causes the foreskin when retracted, 
                              to slide forward again and this is the definitive check. </P>
                            <P>There may at times be some confusion between a short frenulum and 
                              a skin bridge as both involve a skin connection between foreskin and 
                              glans.- as both these (at present) require surgery, a surgeon's visit 
                              is necessary.</P>

                            <P>At which age should these skin malformations be treated? I would 
                              suggest that your son should get used to a non-painful, non-inhibitive 
                              erection as soon as is humanly possible.</P>

        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                                  <A HREF="library/passages/being-a-man.html#start">e.g.18</A> "I remember 
                              having erections around 12 years of age, and started masturbating then. 
                              ... My first doubts emerged at secondary school, when boys used to 
                              talk and joke about masturbating. I could never understand the jokes, 
                              because I had to masturbate in a different way - I rubbed my glans 
                              through my foreskin with the palm of my hand.
                            <P>&quot;I cannot remember when I realised what a foreskin was, and 
                              what it should do. But I remember that masturbating was sometimes painful. 
                              I could not do it when I wanted because I was hurting. Any pain experienced 
                              was short lived, however, and was cured by abstaining.</P>
                            <P>&quot;I think it was around 15 that I began to realise that my penis 
                              was not 'normal'. ... All I wanted was a normal penis. I used to go 
                              to sleep and hope that by the time I woke up I would be normal. ... 
                              At some point around 16 or 17, I decided that I could never have sex, 
                              so I could never marry, nor have children. My condition remained untreated 
                              until the age of 26."</P>
                            <P> It is worth considering what effect the conditions have not only 
                              on actual events but also on future intentions e.g. attitudes to marriage. </P>

                              a teenager I realized it. I saw that I was different from my friends. 
                              I felt embarassed ... Also, I couldn't masturbate easily. I needed 
                              to be very careful and often I did not get orgasm. I knew that I could 
                              not have sex."

                              state...and even then, it does not go completely past the glans...trying 
                              to get the foreskin go behind the glans during an erection would be 
                              unthinkable and impossible (well..it's possible, but I wouldn't want 
                              to die of pain). --- - First off, I realised that something was different 
                              about age 10 when other kids' could expose their glans and I couldn't. 
                              It was disturbing at the time...but I was still young...so I forgot 
                              about it. Since then, I never really noticed anything wrong until about 
                              3 years ago. ---- I don't have any sexual experiences to tell you since 
                              I'm still a virgin...I'm one of those guys who waits until marriage"

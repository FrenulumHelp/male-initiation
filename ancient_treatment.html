          male circumcision. Most of the literature shows no awareness 
          of phimosis - its frequency - or the sexual and erectile problems which can be cured by circumcision. If routine circumcision 
          had been introduced for this most obvious reason of eliminating difficult 
          foreskins; then the importance of an alternative modern method, suitable to our culture's attitudes in this day and age, would be clear. </FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                            </CENTER>
                            <P>The custom predominates in Africa, the Middle East and Australia; 
                              occurs more sporadically in New Guinea, and also among some 
                              tribes of American Indians  - leading to that wonderful 
                              tale about the Conquistadors who, as they landed in America, reasoned 
                              that the natives must be a lost tribe of the Jews. <A HREF="library/xtras/refs.html#ref68">(68)</A></P>
                            <P>The time honoured operations of partial circumcision, dorsal slit 
                                      and frenular incision require far less complexity of tool building 
                                      than the modern full circumcision, (e.g. a clamp to trap the glans 
                                      inside before guillotining off the overhang of the foreskin), and they 
                                  are fully efficient methods of treating foreskin conditions.</P>
                            <P>Apart from the more normal forms of male circumcision which ancient 
                              tribes practiced, there are a number of individual variations.</P>
                            <P>&quot;Long pendulous foreskins are apparently a thing of beauty 
                              for some tribes in New Guinea who deliberately stretch them by suspending 
                              weights from the penis&quot; <A HREF="library/xtras/refs.html#ref45">(45)</A>.</P>
                            <P>There is the possibility of &quot;removing some of the foreskin 
                              and leaving the remainder as a flap, as practiced by the Maasai 
                              and Kikuyu of East Africa, or cutting the foreskin away but retaining 
                              it as two flaps, as practiced by the Tikopia of Polynesia&quot; <A HREF="library/xtras/refs.html#ref46">(46)</A>.</P>
                            <P>&quot;The most rudimentary form of male circumcision is a simple 
                              gash of the prepuce&quot;, &quot;the simple process of tearing the 
                              prepuce with the fingers&quot;, or &quot;a wedge-shaped piece is 
                              excised&quot; <A
HREF="library/xtras/refs.html#ref47">(47)</A>.</P>
                            <P>Several cultures perform an incision of the frenulum, &quot;the 
                              inhabitants of the Loyalty Islands... and, . . on Tahiti&quot; <A HREF="library/xtras/refs.html#ref49">(49)</A>. 
                              In a fascinating description of the <A HREF="frenulum_studies4.html#luo">practices of the Luo</A> a large 
                              variety of traditional cures for frenulum breve are described including: 
                              &quot;One method ... 
                              the use of Okoko ... the male soldier ant. The boy to 
                              undergo the operation had to sit with his legs apart. The Okoko 
                              would then be caught and its incisor like proboscis placed squarely 
                              on the connective tissue that joins the penial foreskin to the male 
                              organ. The Okoko would then tighten grip to sever through the connective 
                              tissue.&quot; <A HREF="library/xtras/refs.html#ref87">(87)</A></P>
                            <P>Interesting is that &quot;In some Turkish families the foreskin 
                              is retracted straight away after birth, and this is done periodically, 
                              in order to prevent adhesions&quot; <A HREF="library/xtras/refs.html#ref48">(48)</A>. </P>
                            <P>One traditional form of monitoring which has come to light is: &quot;In 
                              India a bit of stick is used as a probe, and carried round and round 
                              between the glans and prepuce, to ascertain the exact extent of 
                              the frenum, and that no unnatural adhesions exist.&quot; <A HREF="library/xtras/refs.html#ref60">(60)</A>.</P>
                            <P><B>Conclusion</B><BR>
                              Circumcision, stretching and many of these old fashioned incisions, 
                              would dismiss any possibility of danger from phimosis, adhesions, and 
                              would leave little for the frenulum to pull on.</P>
                            <P>Is it merely coincidental that so many ancient peoples had discovered 
                              such a great variety of simple solutions and effective methods of preventive 
                              treatment, and even a way of monitoring for these preputial problems? </P>
                            <P>Even those ancient genital embellishments which were totally unrelated 
                              to this present theme were performed consciously ... and, whatever 
                              the method, a boy's penis was examined or treated early, by an older 
                              member of the culture. </P>
                            <P>Our culture is probably exceptional in it's omission of any such 
                              custom. This is particularly surprising when the medical approach in 
                              our culture usually emphasises early checks and a preventative attitude.</P>

        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

Am I Alone? - The Cultural Taboo</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="4"></A></A></FONT>
                            <P>When I first discovered my condition, the doctors rejected the idea 
                              that this condition influenced my erection and my sexuality. I thought 
                              my situation must be a complete rarity. I started to research through the literature and question other 
                              people about their experiences.                                    
                            <P>When I first wrote to the Kinsey Institute and the British Health 
                              Education Authority (Oct '94), my sample group consisted of 4 men who had experience of phimosis. 
                              Talking with these first few men was more informative <A HREF="library/xtras/pop_lit.html#start">than over a hundred 
                                publicly available books.</A>
                            <P>When first going on line (Feb 96) I`d talked with around 120 people 
                              and directly with 15 cases. (see <A HREF="library/surround/sample.html#start">impressions from my 
                                first sample group</A>). <A HREF="medical_taboo.html#start"></A>
                            <P>Now, (Feb 2001) I have talked personally with over fourty cases, 
                              and heard through the www. of at least 1,000 more. All experiences 
                              are described in <A HREF="passages.html#start">The Passages to Manhood</A>, not one experience disagrees with my descriptions.                  
                            <P>We seem blinded by cliches about male sexuality e.g. that the size shape etc. has nothing to do with the sexuality, and that no male should worry about their penis, because &quot;everyone's normal we're all just a bit different&quot;                  
                            <P>Male pride avoids this subject. The subject of genital 
                                        difficulties and especially foreskin difficulties is socially unacceptable, 
                                        men don't complain, and especially about foreskins.
                            <P><A HREF="medical_taboo.html#start">Occasional medical studies point out the lack of research.</A><B> &quot;It cannot be masculine pride alone ... which has caused the 
                                        phenomenon to be neglected by male physicians and psychoanalysts, ... 
                                        resulting in a general or collective repression of the phenomenon."</B> (<A HREF="library/medicus/grewel.html#start">Grewel</A>)
                            <P><B>"The request for circumcision to alleviate painful erections 
                                        and intercourse and frenular tears is not widely appreciated in 
                                        the urological literature. Being unpublished, these complaints 
                                        can easily be ignored... "</B> (<A HREF="library/xtras/refs.html#ref11">Pienkos</A>)</P>
                                      <P>My <A HREF="library/xtras/impressions_doctors.html#start">impressions from practicing doctors</A> appear to confirm this, and substantiate Grewel's view of <A HREF="library/surround/psychologist_repression.html#start">the psychologists collective repression</A>. </P>
                                      <P>Our male dominated medical profession appears totally  blind on the subject of phimosis. The clearest demonstration of this is the sheer <A HREF="namings.html#start">lack of terminology</A>. The conditions comprising phimosis have for centuries not been named. On the other hand names for infections caused by phimosis are of sentence long latin complexity. <B>Naming is a clear sign of cultural recognition</B> </P>
                                      <P>This is 
                                        added to the confusing effects of <A HREF="debate.html#start">over a century of anti and pro circumcision 
                                          fanatics</A>, which has left our culture with a legacy of rumours and red herrings 
                                        about foreskin conditions and circumcision.                  
                                      <P>The basis of the taboo lies in deeper areas. Perhaps the evolutionary and social insignificance of the sexually inadequate male plays a role.                   
                                      <P>When I first started thinking about circumcision and phimosis, I used to get a <B>gut reaction in 
                                        my stomach</B>. I could 
                                        only think about it for a short while and then I`d feel disgusted 
                                        and I had to stop, ... but it would keep coming back, ... Why did 
                                        I feel this   revulsion for the theme?

  sexuality appears to contradict every advance in understanding which our culture 
  has made over the last century. - Psychological research has concentrated on parental 
          and environmental phenomenon, and the urological disciplines do not 
          include sexual behaviour. Scientific research has overlooked this area 
          of human sexuality. </FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              Medically speaking, circumcision is indicated when 
                              retraction of the foreskin causes difficulty or pain. With many 
                              degrees of different conditions retraction can involve uncomfortable 
                              or painful experiences sometimes at the beginning of sexual activity, 
                              sometimes during it and sometimes for a period of time afterwards. 
                            <P>When sexual pleasure is consciously associated with pain or difficulty, 
                              then we might expect frustration or even masochistic tendencies to 
                              be encouraged for a period of time (usually at the beginning of puberty). 
                              However, when pain or difficulty is avoided this can lead to far greater 
                              problems. 
                            <P>It is normally considered common sense and healthy for people to 
                              avoid pain and difficulty. If one has a bad shoulder one avoids moving 
                              it, one is limited and confined, but then it does not hurt. With time 
                              and rest some pains will heal, others will worsen. An interesting comparison 
                              is people with angst for dentists who will so successfully develop 
                              the habit of eating on one side of their mouth that for a while they 
                              successfully forget the toothache. 
                            <P>The point is that it is not because 
                    a boy is stupid or in some way psychosexually unbalanced, but like 
                    everyone does with everything else, a boy avoids sensations which are 
                    painful and difficult. In playing with his erection a boy learns that 
                  his foreskin is unmovable, in fact then, in some way untouchable.
                            <P>Often he does not realise that he's avoiding anything. How aware 
                              or unaware a man is, is influenced by many aspects of his life and 
                              general sexual education, but to a large extent it is the nature of 
                              the anatomical condition itself and the consequent type and degree 
                              of pain which determines his response. 
                            <P><B>At the same time as avoiding pain one suppresses awareness.</B> One 
                              avoids even thinking about any area which one is avoiding. Factors 
                              like worry can make pain worse, but someone who is successful in distancing 
                              themselves from pain also subdues their anatomical awareness. Avoiding 
                              pain or difficulty generates an apprehensiveness, fear or anxiety and 
                              this always hinders open minded observation and reasoning - thus confirming 
                              the blind spot - an area which is unknowable and unthinkable. 
                            <P>This is all understandable and sufferers should feel no extra embarrassment 
                              about the possibility of them in some way being stupid for not noticing 
                              or reacting to their condition earlier or later than anyone else.

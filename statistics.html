        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              The frequency of these conditions are generally underestimated. The 
                              statistics for frenulum breve have never been collected (<A HREF="frenulum_studies5.html#start">except 
                                among animals</A>). - The frequency of phimosis is inevitably too low 
                              due to the fact that medical checks are conducted in the flaccid state: 
                              phimosis is by nature less elastic, and expands relatively less than 
                              the rest of the foreskin, therefore any difficulty with retraction 
                              when flaccid, is magnified when erect. See <A HREF="re_statistics.html#start">Realistic

Much modern medical information on circumcision (from popular literature to reports in medical journals), recommends that the best care for a foreskin is to leave it alone. These reports are all based on &Oslash;ster's misinterpreted study. &Oslash;ster made his report following 7 years of education and monitoring. Such care and attention obviously results in less problems.</FONT></P></TD>

                                <P>I am more than a little concerned for infants in families and 
                                  countries, where there is simply not the time to give every care 
                                  and attention to all the pestering kids, as well as looking after 
                                  the local tread mill. I believe these infants need an easy safe 
                                  simple modern method of quickly dissolving the epithelial bond between 
                                  the inner foreskin and the glans, (<a href="prevention.html#start">to allow the infant's foreskin to stretch naturally</a>). </P>
                                <P>As far as I am aware there has been no medical research into the 
                                  subject of dissolving the adhesions with a simple releasing agent or 
                                  solvent.</P>
                                <P> I have no means to explore or discover in this field, and must 
                                  wait until a doctor, research student, or experimental Mum or Dad can 
                                  help me.</P>
                                <P>I believe there must be a simple solvent: olive oil, a camomile 
                                  solution, or some other natural substance. Could urine contain a 
                                  natural releasing agent? Alternatively maybe saliva contains enzymes 
                                  which would be effective. </P>
                                <P><EM>Please Note: I am merely thinking openly, - I do not expect doctorts to use saliva - I would merely like to encourage open minded thinking and if some simple natural substance could be found - then I would hope the doctors would develop it in a modern hygienic form </EM></P>
                                <P>&Oslash;ster says &quot;Separation results from keratinization of 
                                  the cells under the influence of androgen&quot; (quoting : Burrows, 
                                  H. (1944) . The union and separation of living tissues as influenced 
                                  by cellular differentiation. Yale J. Bil. Med., 17,397,)</P>
                                <P>If I ask a few possibly stupid questions, ... Which enzymes could 
                                  speed up keratinization? Could androgen be administered directly? 
                                  I realise keratine has nothing to do with carrots but if it needs 
                                  enzymes then maybe a bit of carrot juice would be the best thing...?</P>

                                <P>Does this indicate that actually Im thinking far too late, and that 
                                                                the easiest time to release adhesions is in the first weeks after

                                <P>Today's medical understanding is that most boys have released 
                                                                their epithelial adhesions by the age of three. If this is not the 
                                                                case, <A HREF="steroids.html#start"> recent medical research suggests</A> it may help to describe the possibility of foreskin retraction to 
                                                                boys of four and administer steroids. 
                                <P>While early education seems appropriate, the experimental use 
                                                                of chemicals may be unacceptable to many parents. Also these steroids 
                                                                are aimed at stretching the infants primary phimotic ring, which 
                                                                is proven to stretch naturally. 
                                <P>Perhaps though in asking how to release the adhesions I have been 
                                                                aking the wrong question, : --- <A HREF="steroids.html#start"> Betamethasone</A> is used to help stretch the phimotic ring but very interesting in 
                                                                the medical studies is that no epithelial adhesions were recorded, 
                                                                this leads me to wonder if steroids could "heat up" and dissolve

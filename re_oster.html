Much modern medical information on circumcision (from popular literature to reports in medical journals), recommends that the best care for a foreskin is to leave it alone. These reports are all based on &Oslash;ster's misinterpreted study. &Oslash;ster made his report following 7 years of education and monitoring.

attitude which was last urgently recommended by Sch&ouml;berlein (1966)

by one remarkable study by Jacob &Oslash;ster. Ironically because it 
actually shows an even more urgent need to monitor.

&Oslash;ster: Statistics and Misinterpretations</FONT></B>
                            <P>The conclusions and statistics from one study by Jacob &Oslash;ster 
                              are mirrored in publications from Dr. Spock's Baby Book (still today 
                              a best seller) to the British Medical Journal.</P>
                            <P>In 1968 Jacob &Oslash;ster <A HREF="library/xtras/refs.html#ref26">(26)</A> reported on a group of almost two thousand boys aged between 6 
                              and 10 yrs. old. He studied them for a period of 7 to 8 years till 
                              they were between 13 and 17 years old. He reported decreasing frequencies 
                              for three separate categories of foreskin restriction: phimosis, 
                              tight prepuce, and adhesions. </P>
                            <P>Many modern medical studies quote &Oslash;ster's figures as 1%; 
                              sometimes referring to &quot;retractile foreskin&quot;, implying 
                              phimosis (Gordon and Collin <A HREF="library/xtras/refs.html#ref24">(24)</A>,), 
                              at other times to &quot;natural separation&quot;, implying epithelial 
                              adhesions (Warren and Bigelow <A HREF="library/xtras/refs.html#ref27">(27)</A>,). </P>
                            <P>Such confusion was partly caused by &Oslash;ster who presented three 
                              separate columns of statistics, and never gave an overall figure, in 
                              addition he states, for example regarding 16-17 year-olds: &quot;tight 
                              foreskin was present in 2%&quot; whereas in his table of statistics 
                              he gives 1%; an analysis shows that in fact this was 1.4%. Whatever 
                              his mathematical failings might have been, his study showed in a revolutionary 
                              way, that phimosis was not necessarily an indication for circumcision.</P>
                            <P>&Oslash;ster wrote &quot;Phimosis is seen to be uncommon in schoolboys, 
                              and the indications for operation even rarer if the normal development 
                              of the prepuce is patiently awaited.&quot; This attitude has unfortunately 
                              frequently been accepted on face value, one modern medical text 
                              even went as far as to interpret this as meaning simply &quot;ignoring&quot; 
                              such conditions and their symptoms <A HREF="library/xtras/refs.html#ref24">(24)</A>.</P>

A Re-Interpretation of &Oslash;ster</FONT></B> </P>
                            <P><A HREF="library/medicus/schoeberlein_eng.html#start">Sch&ouml;berlein</A> <A HREF="library/xtras/refs.html#ref28">(28)</A> says that &quot;in 
                              medical examinations of 3,000 young men, mostly of an age between 
                              18 and 22 years . . . A phimosis was found in 8.8%.&quot;</P>
                            <P><A HREF="library/medicus/beauge.html#start">Beauge</A> <A HREF="library/xtras/refs.html#ref29">(29)</A> was &quot;in charge for over ten years of the routine examination 
                              of college freshmen&quot;, he &quot;observed several hundred cases&quot;. 
                              He reports &quot;Inability to retract the foreskin . . . persists 
                              in about 10% of the subjects at the end of adolescence.&quot;</P>
                            <P>Three other studies covering altogether over 2,200 men, each report 
                              frequencies of over 8% with phimosis, significantly all these three 
                              unrelated studies report &quot;It was completely unknown to some of 
                              the examined boys that the foreskin could be retracted&quot; (<A HREF="statistics.html#saitmacher">Saitmacher</A>). 
  &quot;The ignorance of these young soldiers is remarkable, many of 
                              them expressed suprise at the condition revealed when they retracted 
                              their foreskins: some of them had apparently never done so in their 
                              lives&quot; (<A HREF="statistics.html#osmond">Osmond</A>). &quot;most 
                              patients were unaware that the prepuce was retractable&quot; (<A HREF="statistics.html#parkash">Parkash</A>).</P>
                            <P><B>If phimosis is largely self resolving (as claimed by &Oslash;ster), 
                              why do the other studies report such high figures?</B></P>
                            <P><B>It is clear that &Oslash;ster influenced his own study. He tells 
                              us &quot;the boys received regular instruction about preputial hygiene&quot; 
                              coupled with this the boys were physically examined every year. This 
                              caring attention and instruction started previous to puberty.</B></P>
                            <P>This appears to have helped relieve phimosis to some extent and 
                              encourage the early release of adhesions. At the very least the physical 
                              examinations with the gentle attempts at retraction, would certainly 
                              have been an education for those boys who had not realised that their 
                              foreskin could retract.</P>
                            <P><B>It appears that phimosis occurs at a rate of 1% in 17 yr.olds, 
                              when these boys have been examined and educated for the previous seven 
                              years.</B></P>
                            <P>&Oslash;ster states "The object here was to investigate the incidence 
                              of preputial `adhesions`, phimosis, and smegma production in an unselected 
                              group." While he realises "our actual figures for the incidence of 
                              smegma can only be of limited significance, as the boys received regular 
                              instruction about preputial hygiene." he does not apply this principle 
                              to phimosis - he does not realise that his education may also have 
                              influenced the frequency of phimosis among this very lucky selected 
                              group of boys. 
                            <P>Beauge, after describing how young men with phimosis do not retract 
                              the foreskin during masturbation, reports that instruction about this, 
                              cured a large number of his patients. He wrote <B>&quot;It would appear 
                                then that phimosis . . . diminishes in frequency with age due to the 
                                fact of the manipulation of the penis.&quot;</B></P>
                            <P><B>Conclusion</B><BR>
                              Due to the anatomical difficulties involved it is clear that many boys, 
                              some youths and even a few grown men are not aware of the possibility 
                              of retraction (<A HREF="library/medicus/late_reports.html#start">medical 
                                reports</A>; <A HREF="passages6.html#start">e.mail examples</A>, <A HREF="late-initiate.html#start">analysis</A>). 
                              It is reasonable to assume that education about retraction precedes 
                              the self manipulation which is in some cases necessary to stretch a 
                              phimosis. A medical examination is a very simple and practical way 
                              of educating young children that retraction is possible.</P>
                            <P>The sooner that the process of monitoring a child's ability to retract 
                              his foreskin could begin, the more possibility the child would have 
                              of developing a healthy foreskin which required no correction at a 
                              later stage. The optimal time to begin monitoring and educating a boy's 
                              ability to retract his foreskin would be while his skin structures 
                              are flexible and developing.</P>
                            <P>The medical approach of checking early and preventing when possible 
                              is of particular relevance to this subject, where in some cases, <B>checking 
                                provides an education which will promote prevention.</B></P>

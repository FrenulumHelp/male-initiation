        <P><FONT SIZE="2">Experts have been unable to understand the origin of the practice of routine 
          male circumcision. Most of the literature shows no awareness 
          of phimosis - its frequency - or the sexual and erectile problems which can be cured by circumcision. If routine circumcision 
          had been introduced for this most obvious reason of eliminating difficult 
          foreskins; then the importance of an alternative modern method, suitable to our culture's attitudes in this day and age, would be clear. </FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P>&quot;the operation may be said to be almost worldwide, with the 
                                exception of Europe and non-Semitic Asia.&quot; <A HREF="library/xtras/refs.html#ref54">(54)</A>.</P>
                              <P>Why the ancient Chinese 
                                civilisation and Doctors had not recorded anything about circumcision? 
                                Their traditional literature on sexual health is far more thorough 
                                than much modern literature.</P>
                              <P>Oriental men have shorter foreskins (<A HREF="library/xtras/refs.html#ref25">25</A>) 
                                The Chinese have &quot;obviously  been 
                                equipped with a relatively short foreskin, as a result, the naked 
                                head often peeps out, even when the penis is flaccid&quot; <A HREF="library/xtras/refs.html#ref55">(55)</A>.</P>
                              <P>If the Chinese are already equivalent to being 
                                half circumcised, this would mean that they experienced less individual 
                                necessity for the operation. If circumcision was only rarely necessary 
                                in China, there would be little point introducing it as a routine practice. 
                                <P>In fact, whatever the origins for routine circumcision, if the Chinese 
                                  are already equivalent to being half circumcised, there would be considerably 
                                  less reason for them to adopt the practice.  
                              <P>This opens 
                                up a new question.</P>
                              <P>Routine circumcision dates from probably 
                                around 40,000 years ago. To those cultures who performed circumcision, 
                                cutting the human body was an available concept, and a socially acceptable 
                                thing to do.</P>
                              <P> Traditional Chinese Medicine has it's roots around 6,000 
                                years ago and T.C.M. has never developed surgery as a medical possibility.</P>
                              <P>Is the reason that Chinese Medicine never developed surgery as 
                                a form of treatment, because the Chinese as a race didn't have any 
                                routine operation, which became an understood and accepted part of 
                                their cultural practice? </P>
                              <P>These genital conditions are present on many mammals and thus they predate any human culture. <BR>
                                To what extent have 
                                cultures and their practices been influenced by this frequent occurrance? (<A HREF="origins.html#statistics"><EM>see here for anthropological relevant statistics</EM></A>) <BR>

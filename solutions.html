Much modern medical information on circumcision (from popular literature to reports in medical journals), recommends that the best care for a foreskin is to leave it alone. These reports are all based on &Oslash;ster's misinterpreted study. &Oslash;ster made his report following 7 years of education and monitoring. Such care and attention obviously results in less problems.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

In the immediate future, health care   with self-education through internet is obvious - please see <a href="postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.                                            </font>
                                            <P>The solution to complex problems is often very simple. 
                                            <P>Dr. &Oslash;ster presented the lowest statistics for adolescents 
                                              with phimosis in recorded medical history. This figure was the result 
                                              of a seven year long study with annual monitoring and education. However, &Oslash;ster made the classical mistake of overlooking 
                                              the effect he had on his own study. Please check these 
                                              findings yourself on <A HREF="re_oster.html#start">re-&Oslash;ster</A>. 
                                            <P>Unfortunately, <B>every</B> subsequent medical study giving statistics 
                                              since &Oslash;ster, (ie. since 1968 - (up until 2003),), quotes him directly and uncritically. The real value of his study has not been appreciated 
                                              in general practice. 
                                            <P><B>It is clear, that apart from the logical advantages of checking 
                                              for problems before they occur, monitoring and educating boys encourages their 
                                              awareness and stimulates the self manipulation which in some cases 
                                              is necessary to stretch a stiff foreskin.                                    
                                            </B>
                                            <P><B>Therefore our culture`s  normal caring 
                                              medical approach of monitoring and education, is of particular relevance to this subject because 
                                              monitoring and education directly promote prevention.</B> 
                                            <P>The first step here is explained by Dr. med Jenny Splieth. "Mothers 
                                              should check this, they see their childrens erections" and again, 
                                              "It would be best for parents to check their son's erections during 
                                              infancy ... this would be simplest to do at bath times." <A HREF="library/xtras/refs.html#ref22">(22)</A> </P>
                                            <P>There is another consideration. A child with persisting epithelial 
                                              adhesions must avoid the pain inherant in his condition and must 
                                              limit his casual self exploration and self confirmation during all 
                                              his erections. This cannot be expected to lead to a relaxed sexual 
                                              psychology, or to encourage the early development of a healthy and 
                                              supple foreskin. This is discussed in <A HREF="early-learning.html#start">Chapter 2 Adhesions and Early Learning</A>
                                            <P>I examine the possibility of greatly reducing or even completely 
                                              preventing all stiff foreskin problems by gently releasing or dissolving 
                                              these epithelial adhesions, as early as possible to allow the foreskin 
                                              to develop in a fully healthy flexible, supple manner. A number 
                                              of methods and research ideas are collected under "<A HREF="dissolve.html#start">The

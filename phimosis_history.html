        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>

                                <P>Following is a summary of anthropological literature regarding 
                                  phimosis. A web of sub-files are linked to each individual

                                  any understanding of the specific sexual effects of phimosis were Bryk and Ploss.
                                <HR NOSHADE>
                                <P><A HREF="anthropology/diderot.html#start">DIDEROT</A> - 1779 <BR>
  Diderot`s Encyclop&eacute;die shows considerable knowledge of phimosis and indicates some of the sexual problems involved with foreskin conditions. 
  He makes one 
  small implication that phimosis could be connected with the routine operation. 
                                <P><B><A HREF="ploss.html#start">PLOSS</A> </B>- 1880s<BR>
  Ploss is a time honoured authority in the entire anthropological field. 
  Ploss's theory on the Origin of Routine Male Circumcision (published 
  in 1884) is to my knowledge the first time in an anthropological treatise 
  that phimosis was specifically indicated as cause and origin of the 
  practice. 
<P>He concludes the Jewish practice was due to thoughts of ensuring offspring and numerous posterity, 
  and he backs this up with Bible quotes, (and an awareness of fertility would be expected among such an advanced 
  literate people).</P>
<P>When he talks of natural peoples Ploss principally discusses the 
  normal appearance of the adult penis and the questionable or worrying <I>appearance</I> of infant phimosis, he talks 
  of phimosis "causing difficulties during sexual activity", "as being 
  more or less an obstacle to coitus", even that circumcision occurred 
  at an age preparing for merely "the enjoyment of sex" ... &quot;which 
  prepares for sexual adulthood&quot;. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Plosses theory only received the rather limited interpretation 
  that phimosis only hindered fertility. The original <A HREF="anthropology/ploss_de.html#start">German</A> and <A HREF="anthropology/ploss_eng.html#start">English</A> translation 
  are made available and <A HREF="ploss.html#start">please see paragraphs 3 and 4 which are the passages concerning Ploss's central theory.</A></P>
<P><A HREF="anthropology/andree.html#start">ANDREE</A> AND <A HREF="anthropology/schurtz.html#start">SCHURTZ</A> - 1890s<BR>
    Even the highly respected Andree rejected his previous indecision (1881) 
    and embraced what he understood as Plosses new theory about fertility. 
    (1889) 
<P>The theories on fertility should be in fact credited to Schurtz 
    (1902) who never mentions phimosis, but who "agrees" with Ploss - even 
    going so far as suggesting that following circumcision`s success (at increasin fertility), mutilations 
    such as subincision were introduced to reduce the subsequent unwanted 
    over population .... 
  <P><A HREF="anthropology/renz.html#start">RENZ</A> - 1912<BR>
    In 1912 Plosses original work was rewritten and considerably updated 
    by Renz complete with Renz`s theories on the spiritual elevation of 
    fertility, suggesting routine circumcision sanctified the generative 
    faculties, as complement and expression of the fertility cult. 
  <P><A HREF="anthropology/fertility.html#start">FERTILITY. <BR>
  </A>In 1899 Spencer and Gillan broke the news which is now an accepted 
    anthropological fact : native peoples have no concept of the relationship 
    between semen and fertility (see- <A HREF="anthropology/fertility.html#start">fertility</A>). 
    Even though the medical discussion still continued on whether phimosis 
    did or did not hinder fertility (till at least 1960), as far as 
    any anthropological theories were concerned fertility was invalid 
    as explanation for any of the customs and practices of the natural 
    peoples.
  
  <P><A HREF="anthropology/hastings.html#start"><B>HASTINGS</B></A> - 1910<BR>
    Hastings Encyclopedia of Religion gives an excellent introduction to 
    the subject in its entirety. Louis H. Gray who wrote the article, shows 
    a good knowledge of foreskin conditions and modern medical practice 
    concerning infections and even impotence, but does not make any connection 
    between modern and ancient surgery. 
  <P>Throughout the entire article on the ancient practice he indicates 
    a number of general sexual reasons for the operation, but he mentions 
    phimosis only once, when he quotes Ploss suggesting &quot;as an 
    attempt to correct nature, and, by averting phimosis, to ensure 
    offspring for the person operated on. The frequent performance of 
    the rite long before puberty he interprets as an effort to guarantee 
    the child a posterity as numerous as possible'&quot; <A HREF="library/xtras/refs.html#ref77">(77)</A>. </P>
  <P> Louis H. Gray is the only researcher (apart from myself), who relies 
    on Plosses original text instead of Renzs rewritten misinterpretation.</P>
  <P>JENSEN 1930s<BR>
    In Jensen's entire book on circumcision, his only mention of phimosis 
    is where he rejects Ploss who suggests &quot;as reason the correction 
    of phimosis which we reject, along with many other attempts at explanations, 
    because this suggests that the originators of this practice had 
    ulterior motives and from everything we know of them, this was certainly 
    far from these peoples way of thinking.&quot; <A HREF="library/xtras/refs.html#ref43">(43)</A>. 
    (implicitly referring to the principle that natural peoples had 
    no understanding of fertility - though Jensen`s logic is not apparent 
    then &quot;the correction of phimosis&quot; which is what Ploss 
    suggested is not the fertility for which he is rejected ... nevertheless 
    ... rather than bore you with Jensen ...).</P>
  <P><B><A HREF="bryk.html#start">BRYK</A> 1930s<BR>
  </B><A HREF="bryk.html#start">The Summary of Bryk gives quotes and references in full </A>  
  <P>Bryk's book is the most detailed study of circumcision. He devotes 116 pages to the origins of the practice. Bryk`s study is entertaining and enlightening, however it also displays 
    his ability for academic debate of all possible angles and this can 
    confuse the reader! 
  <P>Bryk based his understanding of routine circumcision on &quot;the foreskin complex&quot; and the natural response to this was to uncover the glans, which he calls denudation. <FONT SIZE="3">He refers to many cultures 
                                where an almost intuitive uncovering of the glans takes place. </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">H</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">e 
                                  establishes (Bryk`s italics) <I>&quot;This mechanical uncovering of the glans is the fundamental 
                                    motive for circumcision.</I>&quot; </FONT>- <FONT SIZE="3">Undoubtedly 
                                      this is a very common and elementary occurrence, sometimes even a custom, </FONT> but as he says &quot;It did not cause circumcision, but stimulated 
                              it and prepared the ground&quot; He argues that this
                                  &quot;prepared the ground&quot; for observations in the animal and 
                                  adult world, which provided the &quot;impetus&quot; to introduce circumcision 
                                  as a routine measure.  
  <P>Bryk discusses at great length the &quot;foreskin complex&quot; 
                              as though this were a general problem with foreskins, which mysteriously sometimes displays disconnected symptoms, however, he fails 
                              to identify the symptoms of frenulum 
                              breve and phimotic ring in their differing lengths and forms. 
  <P><FONT SIZE="3">&quot;...</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> the foreskin often places 
      a decided restriction in the way, which is sometimes even painful, 
      for after penetration the glans can be strangulated, 
        which complicates the act, or, when the prepuce does not lay the glans 
        bare,  ...&quot; - Here, Bryk 
            describes paraphimosis and phimosis without actually naming them</FONT></P>
  <P>Bryk continues quoting Eylmann and demonstrating his clear lack of understanding 
    . &quot;Cases of the sort where the opening is so small, that making 
    love causes pain, and even urinating is not easy occur so seldomly 
    that our discussion does not need to take them into consideration.&quot; 
    -  
    All the different degrees can not be jumbled together in one sentence. 
    The degrees of phimosis which cause pain during sex do not restrict 
    urination. (see <A HREF="phimosis_summary.html#start">Phimosis</A>)--- Concerning the frenulum he writes "by which the glans 
    of the penis is drawn crooked during erection, ejaculation is made 
    more difficult". (see <A HREF="frenulum_breve.html#start">Frenulum</A>) </P>
  <P>He understands phimosis as a rarity, and he fails to identify phimosis in its various forms and symptoms. He  argues &quot;the foreskin complex&quot; as a general problem with foreskins with denudation as the natural response.
  <P>LEYMANN - 1950s<BR>
    In 1957 Leymann presents the most recent anthropological source 
    available to me which mentions phimosis. He jumbles phimosis and 
    infections together as `hygienic' reasons for the operation, and 
    then says that hygienic reasons will &quot;always remain individual 
    cases.&quot; <A HREF="library/xtras/refs.html#ref79">(79)</A>
  
  <P>The <I>logic</I> of the above discussions was accepted as common 
    sense, and as hygiene and fertility were discounted, and anyway 
    as phimosis only required &quot;an occasional operation&quot; then 
    any theories on phimosis vanished from the books. Bettelheim Weiss 
    and <A HREF="anthropology/eliade.html#start">Eliade`s Religious 
      Encyclopedia</A> not even mentioning foreskin conditions except 
    in one remarkable passage:</P>
  <P><B><A HREF="anthropology/bettelheim.html#start">BETTELHEIM</A> </B>- 1960s<BR>
    Bettelheim's is a wonderful source book, but he never mentions phimosis. He collectively discards all 
    theories to do with fertility, (including <A HREF="anthropology/sacrifice.html#start">Freud`s 
      oedipus complex</A>) for the reasons given in <A HREF="anthropology/fertility.html#start">the discussion on fertility</A>. 
    His psychological perspective on the subject <A HREF="anthropology/hastings.html#start"></A> is truly fascinating, but he missed the obvious, the physical. 
  <P>In one remarkable passage about <A HREF="anthropology/bettelheim.html#start">a 
    boy suffering painful adhesions, Bettelheim</A> says: &quot;From 
    this we cannot draw conclusions about the emotions of boys in pre 
    literate societies toward circumcision, if they are not suffering 
    from adhesions.&quot; <A HREF="library/xtras/refs.html#ref12">(12)</A>. 
    He does not seem to have realised that practically all infants suffer 
    these adhesions. </P>
  <P>NOTE: <A HREF="anthropology/hastings.html#start">Hastings</A>, <A HREF="bryk.html#start">Bryk</A> and <A HREF="anthropology/bettelheim.html#start">Bettelheim</A> are wonderful source books (moreso than the inspired <A HREF="ploss.html#start">Ploss</A> who unfortuantely rambles repetitively) well worth reading, thoroughly

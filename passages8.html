        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                                      With all these skin misdevelopments, the final recognition of an anatomical 
                                      problem often follows a conscious experience of pain or difficulty 
                                      and this often occurs during a youth's first intimate relationships 
                                      when making love or attempting to, because at this time they are unavoidable. 
                                      At this time, the erection, penetration and ejaculation are not exclusively 
                          controlled by one`s own hands.                            
                        
                          <P><I><A HREF="library/passages/fren-ring-complex.html#start">e.g.23</A></I> "During Masturbation I do not retract the foreskin, but in sexual intercourse 
                  the foreskin is pulled painfully back and gets stuck in the sulcus 
                  behind the glans. - ... I am unable to reach orgasm like this and what 
                  is more, have on occasions lost erection due to the pain ... this embarrassing 
                  and painful problem." 
                            <P><I><A HREF="library/passages/falsch-diagnosis.html#start">e.g.24</A></I> "Well, yes, of course, it is hindering my relationship. I have a girlfriend. 
                                        I am 25 and she is 21 and we did not have much sexual intercourse until 
                                        now. The problem is in fact the phimosis, it hurts, so it does not 
                                        make much fun." 
                            <P>It is significant that in my interviewed sample group there were 
                                                            a number of cases of simple frenular rips which had healed spontaneously 
                                                            and only one of these had contacted his doctor. This is occurring at 
                                                            a far greater frequency than the medical profession realises. Though 
                                                            in itself, frenular rips are "no problem", the worrying question which 
                                                            must be asked is: why is this being allowed to happen so often, confusing 
                                                            the first experiences of young lovers,why is not prevented beforehand?</P>
                                      <P>When the frenulum breve does not rip by intercourse, it will either 
                                        hold the foreskin forward, or it will cause pain and tension and such 
                                        pains often require young lovers to take a few days pause from any 
                                        sexual activity. 
                                      <P>Whereas phimosis is often incorrectly and inadequately described 
                  (e.g. <A HREF="library/xtras/kinsey.html#start">Kinsey Institute: 
                    as an infection</A>), frenulum breve is usually left undefined, 
                  simply not mentioned, a complete mystery even to the men themselves. 
                  Men describe the most vague symptoms, a pain underneath, a pain 
                  for a few days afterwards, pulls back further on top than underneath. 
                            
                                      <P><I><A HREF="library/passages/didnt-know.html#start">e.g.25</A></I> "I am 23 and didn't realise that the foreskin was meant to retract. 
                                        I have a girlfriend and when we try to have intercourse it hurts me 
                                        because it feels like the skin is pulling all the time." 
                                      <P><I><A HREF="library/passages/clear-fren.html#start">e.g.26</A></I> Another man who was also 23 yrs. old "I have made love many times, 
                                        but most of them I have felt pain, and I still get wounds in my penis, 
                                        but not always. ... The thing is, in the beginning of my sexual relationships <I>(RS. i.e. by penetration)</I> I get pain in my frenulum," 
                                      <P> <I><A HREF="library/passages/fren-rips.html#start">e.g.27</A></I> "Hi ... recently I ripped my frenulum breve when trying to have sex 
                                        with my girlfriend. I had noticed considerable discomfort before this 
                                        incident took place, but I just gave it time to heal before participating 
                                        in any more sexual encounters with my girlfriend." 
                                      <P>So we see that not only our young men, but also our young women 
                                        are involved in this crazy development, this ommission in routine health 
                                        prevention and care. How much 
                                        longer will the first love experiences of our young people be distorted 
                                        through this cultural neglect?

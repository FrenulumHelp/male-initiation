        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              your condition, - to make it worth a doctor discussing treatment

                              If you`re totally new to the subject then the following may help. </P>
                            <P>To a man who has never retracted his foreskin, it appears to be 
                              made from one thick layer of skin, similar to the tongue or an ear 
                              lobe. This is not the case. There is no join between the outer and 
                              inner surfaces of the foreskin, the inner and outer foreskin are one 
                              continuous layer or sheet of skin which is folded back on itself. What 
                              is meant by retracting the foreskin, is that one pulls back on the 
                              outer foreskin. The inner surface of a healthy foreskin, will roll 
                              out from underneath and spread back evenly over the shaft.</P>
                            <P>In order to start a self diagnosis: - WHEN FLACCID slowly and gently 
                              start retracting the foreskin.</P>
                            <P> Very rarely infant adhesions can still be bonded in early adulthood, 
                              they usually release last in the area around the frenulum. </P>
                            <P>Occasionally among uncircumcised boys skin bridges usually take 
                              the form of a single strip or string of skin between the foreskin and 
                              the glans, (these often occur directly beneath the urinary opening, 
                              thus may easily be confused with an extremely short frenulum - <A HREF="diagnosis.html#probe">see 
                                later</A>).</P>
                            <P><B>When attempting retraction - The most common conditions are phimotic 
                              ring and frenulum breve</B> - and these often occur together so that 
  "it`s difficult to see where the one starts and the other ends" - one 
                              will usually predominate. 
                            <P>With a normal foreskin as the outer skin pulls back, the inner foreskin 
                              turns inside out and rolls back unfolding freely. <BR>
                              If you can get it back "so far" <BR>
                              The phimotic ring lies just inside the join between inner and outer 
                              foreskin and this is most evident on the top side of the penis, so 
                              looking from above, with phimotic ring as the outer pulls back, only 
                              a small strip of the inner turns over and at the foremost edge of the 
                              inner foreskin a fine line of the white (or occasionally red(?)) band 
                              of a phimotic ring will be visible. 
                            <P><A NAME="finger"></A>If you have a loose phimotic ring, which seems 
                              undetectable when flaccid, try this: insert two clean little fingers, 
                              (or even one finger and a q.tip) in the end of the foreskin and pull 
                              (gently) sidewards, you will feel very clearly most of the skin is 
                              elastic except for a thin ring, so thin that you feel if it was wire 
                              it would cut you, this is the phimotic ring. 
                            <P>With frenulum the restriction is underneath the glans, so as the 
                              outer foreskin is pulled back a good centimeter or more of inner foreskin 
                              turns over above, but now look underneath and you see the restriction 
                              staring to pull the glans downwards. 
                            <P><FONT SIZE="4"><B>MORE DETAILS for those who are still unsure</B></FONT>
                            <P><B>PHIMOTIC RING</B><BR>
                              The phimotic ring or noose is a thin line or contour of rigid skin 
                              on the inner foreskin, just behind the tip of the foreskin on the 
                              upper side of the foreskin, however on the lower side of the foreskin 
                              there is a flap of skin which you can flip away downwards quite 
                              freely.</P>
                            <P>Retracting gently, if there is any degree of difficulty in retraction, 
                              do not use any force, there is a danger of <A HREF="paraphimosis.html#start">paraphimosis</A> or <A HREF="phimosis/stretching_lsa.html#start">ripping</A> etc.. 
                              Would the foreskin retract when flaccid - with lubrication? If you 
                              can retract without any difficulty, there is often a clearly visible 
                              hourglass effect around the shaft. .(see <A HREF="phimosis_research.html#start">Phimosis 
                                Research</A>).</P>
                            <P><B>Mysterious Conditions</B><BR>
                              Many men call what they have: phimosis, but they describe sensations 
                              which I`ve learnt to recognise as symptoms for frenulum breve<B>: </B>the 
                              foreskin always slides forward again; too much foreskin; can retract 
                              esasily when flaccid but not at all when erect; or: discomfort, tightness 
                              or pain following intercourse. The point is that when there`s just 
                              a mysterious, indistinct discomfort; tightness, pain its very often 
                              a symptom for frenulum breve. 
                            <P><A NAME="fren"></A> <B>FRENULUM BREVE</B><BR>
                              When flaccid or erect, <B>if you hold the foreskin in the retracted 
                                position</B> and look sideways, you will be able to see if the glans 
                              bends downwards. When the foreskin is retracted as far as possible 
                              even minor degrees of frenulum breve will bend the glans at a obviously 
                              distorted angle to the shaft of the phallus. There is some doubt in 
                              my mind as to how the surgeon defines which degree indicates a frenulum 
                              which is too short. Therefore the best test is: the frenulum is too 
                              short if, when erect, it causes the retracted foreskin to slide forward 
                              again and recover the glans.</P>
                            <A NAME="probe"></A><B>THE PROBE CHECK</B><BR>
The frenulum may be so extremely short that it is non-existent, and 
  connects the foreskin directly to the glans beneath the urinary opening. 
  A probe check would be necessary to decide if this was in fact a 
  malformation of the frenulum, or a skin bridge. - If you suffer an 
  extreme phimosis further diagnosis for frenulum or skin bridges necessitates 
  a probe. - Adults may be able to use the probe check, however this 
  could be dangerous if any infection was present. (Probe is shaped 
  like a mini q.tip - smooth plastic - which you roll round inside 
  the foreskin), - no responsibility is taken for the completeness 
  or accuracy of the descriptions. - Please see <A HREF="phimosis/probe.html#start">The 
  Probe Check</A>

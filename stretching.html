        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. My concern is the early prevention of phimosis. The late correction of adult phimosis was never my interest. My belief is that once the medical profession realise the need, they will develop hundreds of new methods of treatment which I cant even imagine ... Therefore treatment  is  purely an appendix on this site, however, because I have no specific bias, my research allowed a rare objective survey of the many posibilities. </FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site offers  detailed information 
          on  individual problem related treatment, often advising simple, cheap, minimal and specific surgery and time honoured solutions taken from traditional methods including partial circumcision, dorsal slit and frenular incision and tying.

                            </P>
                            <P>1. <A HREF="library/medicus/beauge.html#start">Dr.Beauge's</A> stretching methods are reported to start working for simple primary 
                              phimotic ring within two weeks. Using <A HREF="steroids.html#start">Steroid</A> creams eg. betamethasone, will speed up the process. 
                            <P>2. Stretching must be gentle and regular. The more often and the 
                              more gentle you are the more effect this has when stretching skin. 
                              (Using force may easily cause little rips.) Repeatedly rhymically 
                              tensing and flexing is more effective than holding a stretch under 
                              tension. 
                            <P>3. If there is only a little difficulty retracting the foreskin 
                              behind the glans do not force it, there is a danger of the foreskin 
                              sticking behind the glans. see <A HREF="paraphimosis.html#start">Paraphimosis</A>
                            <P>4. With pinhole phimosis and extreme closures of the end of the 
                              foreskin it is first necessary to stretch the preputial opening 
                              by pulling it backwards around the conical shape of the glans. Success 
                              is often reported pulling backwards against the erect glans (Beauge 
                              says it is essential to stretch round the circumference of the erect 
                              glans). However do not stretch the ring over the ridge of the glans 
                              causing soreness, and do not use extreme force, pushing the erection 
                              backwards and causing groin injuries. 
                            <P>5. As soon as the foreskin opening is wide enough - introduce 
                              two (clean little) fingers into the opening of the foreskin and 
                              pull the foreskin gently outwards (ie. where you feel the constricting 
                              ring). This is the most effective and safe method - (Pulling the 
                              foreskin forward has no effect) 
                            <P>6 Lubricants, warm bath water, steam and humidity in the shower 
                              can help
                            <P>7. If its no fun to stretch then you can change and develop the 
                              methods ... experiment carefully and intelligently ...</P>
                            <P>Use a vibrator, - pulling the foreskin forward over the vibrating 
                              glans shape - vibrating possibly stimulates tissues and blood flow. 
                              - If it is fun to stretch playing with different sized ball bearings 
                              or any hygienic conical or rounded shape - or even any mechanical 
                              instruments of torture - if it turns you on, then this is the method 
                              for you and please use it and report to <A HREF="contact.html#start">me</A> or <A HREF="arcindex.html#start">ARC forum</A> on your success </P>
                            <P>8. - After two weeks regular stretching with no success, - you 
                              probably have a secondary ring and need to learn a bit more and 
                              look for <A HREF="phimosis_treatment.html#start">other forms of 
                                treatment</A>.</P>                            </TD>

                                    <P align="left">It would be really nice if all my info was not lost, and it needs more than one person to develop different sides.                                    There is no copyright - <a href="library/xtras/copyright.html">(the copyright looks like this</a>.)</P>
                                    <P align="left">Please use the information - copy what you want from the site - develop a new design - a classical version, a punk version, etc.  I believe a wiki version of a lot of the texts would really help with clarity. And <strong>Internet  needs  a site with videos and pictures</strong>. </P>
                                    <p align="left">Its a great little subject because its such a tabooed area - there has been so little research - its all new land ... but its got no street cred. ... its nothing you can talk about ... so its a lonely job, and this brings me to : </p>
                                    <P ALIGN="left"><strong>There is still no group supppoprting education on Phimosis</strong>. But large anti and pro circ. movements had begun with quarterly magazines before Internet even started.                                     
                                    <P ALIGN="left">Doctors and uni. professors have written many articles on the anti and pro circ. view points .... these are the only public lobbies and the only influence on popular opinion; and  the only question most people have on the subject is whether &quot;to circ. or not?&quot;.
                                    As if there were only 2 simple alternatives! 
                                    <P ALIGN="left">So, this is my latest attempt to get some sort of gathering of people -  who feel the   importance of the subject  ... the chaos and futility of the whole phimosis experience - and that future   kids dont need to go through that ridiculous waste of time and energy   and love.
                                    
                                    <P ALIGN="left">If this concerns you, PLEASE write a short mail,  (it would help me if you write &quot;phimosis support group&quot; in the subject line) 
                                    <P ALIGN="left">With the needs of good parenting ... and with modern social networking possibilities ... i feel sure that  these days, a support group could form. ... i will log into the mailbox and try to help a support group find its legs once a month - (we have a private forum).

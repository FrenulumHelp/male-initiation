          male circumcision. Most of the literature shows no awareness 
          of phimosis - its frequency - or the sexual and erectile problems which can be cured by circumcision. If routine circumcision 
          had been introduced for this most obvious reason of eliminating difficult 
          foreskins; then the importance of an alternative modern method, suitable to our culture's attitudes in this day and age, would be clear. </FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                            <P>The development of the ancient practice of partial circumcision  is shrouded in mystery, (Please note, the author does not discuss any value for the routine modern full circumcision).. Experts in anthropology and more recently psychology have been 
                              unable to establish the origin of the practice of routine male circumcision. 
                            <P>The anthropological and psychological theories on the origins 
                              of the practice of routine male circumcision, discuss if this began 
                              as a manifestation of cultural requirements (e.g. hygiene, initiation, 
                              fertility, tribal mark, sacrifice, sexual advantages); or the expression 
                              of unconscious tendencies (e.g. castration complex, menstruation 
                              envy, regression). </P>
                            <P>The modern anthropologist regards circumcision as an unsolvable 
                              mystery. Modern theories assume that the practice was based on a number of combined factors.
                            <P>Phimosis was refuted  because a) the 
                              natural peoples did not appreciate the association between the penis, semen and 
                              fertility (anthropologists assumed that the problem with phimosis is that it hinders semen emission) and b) phimosis is thought to be a rarity, however this opinion was established previous to any statistical studies.                             
                            <P>Modern writers never mention phimosis.  Since 1960 any discussion 
                              of phimosis as origin for circumcision has vanished from the books.
                            <P> Phimosis was 
                                     last discussed by Ploss (1884) and Bryk (1931). 
                                  <A HREF="anthropology_index.html#start">Anthropological studies</A>, 
                              lists fully all relevant texts including the <A HREF="ploss.html#start">original Ploss</A>; and <A HREF="bryk.html#start">Bryk's 
                                  full discussion</A>. 
                            <P><A HREF="ploss.html#start">Ploss</A> was largely misinterpreted. He claimed phimosis to be the origin of routine male circumcision, he did <B><EM>not</EM></B> claim fertility to be of any great relevance apart from among  fairly advanced lierate cultures.                             
                                  <P><A NAME="statistics"></A>Bryk thought 
                                           phimosis was <A HREF="bryk.html#rarity">far too great a rarity to be considered 
                                             as originating factor.</A> However neither he nor any other anthropologist 
                                           ever refers to a statistical study. 
                                           In 1931 there 
                                           were no statistical studies. 
                                  <P>A clear understanding of the statistics is important to this subject because at present the main reason anthropologists dismiss phimosis as the origin, is because they believe it is a rarity.                                  
                                  <P> I discuss <A HREF="statistics.html#start">all the available statistical 
                                    reports</A>. These show between 2.4% and 14%,. however most show 
                                    that in careful spot checks at least 8% young men have problems of 
                                    retraction in the non-erect state. This figure does not assess the frequency of erectile problems, infections, or frenulum breve. In addition, this 
                                    figure is given for only one point of time in life, it does 
                                    not represent how many men have problems with phimosis during their 
                                    entire lives.
                                  <P>However even a scientifically measured 10% can only give a basic idea on the actual frequency. 
                                  The practice originated among the hunting peoples. 
                              Hunting peoples lived in tribal groups of a size which are renowned 
                              for their unreliable statistical fluctuations. 
                            With a basic measurement of 10% at one time in life, in a small family group we would expect the frequency to periodically vary between 0% and 100%. 
                                  <P>When we consider that different forms of phimosis can become problematic in childhood adulthood 
                                    or old age, we see how males could have problems with a form of 
                                    phimosis, in 3 or 4 generations of the same family group simultaneously.                                  </P>
                                  <P> <B>I suggest the first routine steps were taken during one of 
                                    the periods of high frequency.</B>
                                  <P>The full extent of the effects of these conditions have 
                              only recently come to light, largely due to the anonymity of Internet 
                              where adult men have been able to record their experiences openly 
                              for the first time.
                                  <P>A man who had personal experience of the problems involved with 
                              phimosis  has motives for introducing the practice, which no anthropologist has ever discussed. 
                                  <P><B>I suggest routine partial circumcision 
                              was originally introduced  by men who had personal 
                              experience of foreskin problems. </B>
                                  <P>There are numerous individual degrees and combinations of foreskin 
                                    conditions, each causing specific physical effects during erection. 
                                    The mysterious appearance of a secondary phimosis occurring throughout 
                                    adulthood, the almost invisible relative phimosis and the apparent 
                                  infant phimosis - all add to the symptomatic complexity.                                   
                                  <P>Some conditions are merely irritating others are painful, some 
                                    typically result in inflammations and disease, some cause problems 
                                    by urination, others during masturbation; some during penetration, others 
                                    during intercourse and still others for several days after intercourse.
                                  <P>We are considering a large variety of difficulties influencing 
                                    various different areas of health and sexual activity.
                                  <P>In pre-literate times it would not have been possible to start 
                                    understanding and classifying all these problematic conditions, 
                                    the symptoms would have been totally mystifying, but contrary to 
                                    the confusion and complications, the cure would have been simple 
                                    and obvious and for a people who required practical answers, the 
                                    best reasoning would have been done with a sharp knife.
                                  <P><B>I suggest routine circumcision </B><B>was originally introduced 
                              as an all cure as a practical and simple solution to, and prevention 
                              of, a number of confusing and chaotic problems.</B>
                                  <P>A further section examines the various reasons why among some 
                              peoples the practice became established - the oldest living surgical 
                              tradition - and thus heralded the beginnings of the surgical practice 
                              in Western medicine.</P>
                            <P>If routine circumcision had initially been introduced for this 
                              most obvious reason of eliminating difficult foreskins; it would 
                              underline the importance of a modern alternative form of prevention.

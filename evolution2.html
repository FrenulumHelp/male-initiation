              restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. What is the evolutionary relevance of phimosis and foreskin conditions. Why has phimosis not been deselected?</FONT></P></TD>

                                  Why is there a phimotic ring? <BR>
                                  Why did we evolve a phimotic ring? <BR>
                                  --- and why wasnt it deselected?
                                <P> This idea occurred to me maybe because the last few weeks Ive been repairing my roof. This involves roof-covering which one sticks to the roof, folds over the sides, and then nails the sides down. - You must hammer the sides down because otherwise the wind can get underneath and rip the covering off.
                                <P> Its a simple almost mechanical point. 
                                <P> If we had evolved with infant epithelial adhesions - sticking the prepuce and glans together without any phimotic ring, then the prepuce would easily rip off the glans, causing considerable damage and skin bridges etc.
                                <P> I wish I could trace the development back to mammals - but I really dont understand the os-penis of mammals and the spongy filling cavaties of the primate penis.
                                <P> I suspect evolution only had primates to practice with and needed to experiment with synchronising when the protecting ring releases, and when the epithelium keratinizes.- and didnt get the timing quite right.
                                <P> So, it seems there was a priority for evolution and mother nature <B>to protect the epithelium till it had time to release by itself without being ripped</B>, and it was either irrelevant or supported other evolutionary necessities if this meant that sometimes the ring was still too tight to be sexually functional when the appropriate time came.
                                <P>The anti circs call the phimotic ring "the preputial sphincter", and  claim that its there to protect the glans till late puberty. Yes I  could think of it as a preputial sphincter,  but I give it another meaning and purpose, : of protecting the  epithelium, for the first year or two (so that it does not rip) - and not directly to do  with protecting the glans.
                                <P> Rob

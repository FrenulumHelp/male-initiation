        <P><FONT SIZE="2">The concept that an anatomical deficiency in the erection can influence the 
  sexuality appears to contradict every advance in understanding which our culture 
  has made over the last century. - Psychological research has concentrated on parental 
          and environmental phenomenon, and the urological disciplines do not 
          include sexual behaviour. Scientific research has overlooked this area 
          of human sexuality. </FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              Physically a short frenulum is awkwardly hidden underneath and behind 
                              the foreskin. Especially when erect the difficulty is totally hidden 
                              and to discover the cause of the problem involves the sufferer in movements 
                              which for him, are unnatural contortions: - pulling the foreskin backwards, 
                              enduring the tension, then turning the phallus sidewards. 
                            <P>Men with severe phimosis often never experience any pain, they 
                              simply find retraction impossible. On the other hand relative phimosis 
                              is invisible when flaccid. Clemmensen wrote &quot;The lesion usually 
                              affects the inner blade of the prepuce, leaving for direct examination 
                              only a nonretractable prepuce ... .&quot; <A HREF="library/xtras/refs.html#ref94">(94)</A><BR>

                            <P>There is an area of his own intimate sexual world which a man with 
                              these conditions either can't explore or is difficult to explore. His 
                              experience is that the foreskin is designed to remain forward, or that 
                              his glans is only revealed when flaccid. Retracting the foreskin appears 
                              to be and for him personally is, an unnatural act. <BR>

                              Most boys in all cultures are curious to compare their genitals. Any 
                              boy with any form of sexual inhibition does not look at or admire his 
                              penis as much as he would without this inhibition. He is not as aware 
                              of himself and in turn he is not as interested generally in comparison 
                              or in pictures, information or education about the male phallus (especially 
                              relevant in those countries without any <A HREF="library/xtras/pop_lit.html#start">public 
                                info.</A>). 
                            <P>He believes that all uncircumcised men cannot reveal their naked 
                              glans and interprets pictures of the retracted foreskin as belonging 
                              to circumcised men. Hearing he has a "glans", he often understands "glands" 
                              are always some sort of secret essence.

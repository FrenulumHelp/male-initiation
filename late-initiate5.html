        <P><FONT SIZE="2">The concept that an anatomical deficiency in the erection can influence the 
  sexuality appears to contradict every advance in understanding which our culture 
  has made over the last century. - Psychological research has concentrated on parental 
          and environmental phenomenon, and the urological disciplines do not 
          include sexual behaviour. Scientific research has overlooked this area 
          of human sexuality. </FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                                <B>Many youths are treated during puberty or after first intercourse due to an unavoidably painful 
                                  experience.<BR>
                          <BR>
                                  Otherwise, two general types of experience are occurring. These 
                                  relate directly to the form of pain or difficulty each condition causes. </B><B>There is the subconscious development </B><B>and the semi-conscious development</B></P>
                          </BLOCKQUOTE>
                            <P>In the <B>subconscious development</B> the youth experiences no conscious 
                              symptoms of difficulty or pain (these have been repressed and there 
                              is no recurrent or obvious symptomatic difficulty) it does not occur 
                              to him that a part of his own natural body is limiting him - he grows 
                              accustomed to his condition never questioning nature; believing: "I 
                              am normal"
                                      <P>He is fully unaware that his condition requires 
                                        treatment and indeed he may go through life without it ever being treated.                  
                            <P>With the <B>semi-conscious development</B>, pain is typically experienced 
                    indirectly often following sexual activity. Here the man feels doubt, but 
                    is unwilling to question it any further; believes "I am not normal" 
                    (feeling he must be a rarity because <I>everyone is normal</I>) feels 
                    shame guilt and worry, and finds that repressing this and accepting 
                    himself as he is, is preferable to having to confront this impossibly 
                    embarrassing problem. 
                                      
                                      <P>A phobic anxiety of the truth may develop, usually 
                                        avoiding the need to operate till early adulthood. This lack of confrontation 
                                        is nothing to be additionally ashamed or guilty about, people in many 
                                        other life situations postpone actions and then embarrassed about having 
                                        put it off so long, feel the simplest way out is to put it off even 
                                        longer. </P>
                                      <P>Both and probably 
                                        all forms of development lead to a <I> chaos factor</I> which is 
                                        accepted and accomodated in the personality. </P>

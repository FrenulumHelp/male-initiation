          male circumcision. Most of the literature shows no awareness 
          of phimosis - its frequency - or the sexual and erectile problems which can be cured by circumcision. If routine circumcision 
          had been introduced for this most obvious reason of eliminating difficult 
          foreskins; then the importance of an alternative modern method, suitable to our culture's attitudes in this day and age, would be clear. </FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                                  <P>The relevant anthropological and texts are collected under <A HREF="anthropology_index.html#start">Anthropological 
                                    Studies.</A> Modern writers never mention phimosis. Phimosis was 
                                    last discussed by Ploss (1876) and Bryk (1931). 
                                  <P> Bryk thought 
                                    it was <A HREF="bryk.html#rarity">far too great a rarity to be 
                                      considered as originating factor.</A> However in 1931 there 
                                    were no statistical studies. I discuss all the presently available statistical 
                                    reports. These show that even when assessed in the non-erect state at least 8% of men suffer phimosis. 
                                  <P>In addition, the practice originated among the hunting peoples.                       Hunting peoples lived in tribal groups. Seen statistically, these 
                                    are of a size which are renowned for their erratic fluctuations. I suggest

                                  <P>Lets reconsider - some forms of phimosis are merely irritating others

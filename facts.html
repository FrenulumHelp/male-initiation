Much modern medical information on circumcision (from popular literature to reports in medical journals), recommends that the best care for a foreskin is to leave it alone. These reports are all based on &Oslash;ster's misinterpreted study. &Oslash;ster made his report following 7 years of education and monitoring. Such care and attention obviously results in less problems.</FONT></P></TD>

                                <P>That the foreskin normally retracts is hardly ever mentioned in 
                                  literature on sexuality. Due to their conditions and the consequent 
                                  actual experience that their foreskin does not retract, the fact of 
                                  life that the foreskin should be free to retract is not clear or apparrent 
                                  to many boys.</P>
                                <P>Books which discuss circumcision should include some sort of intelligent, 
                                  accurate and adequate information (see <A HREF="library/xtras/pop_lit.html#start">Available 
                                    Information</A>), on the normal ability of the foreskin to retract, 
                                  so that boys, youths and grown men who experience difficulties and 
                                  are attempting to educate themselves can readily find information. </P>
                                <P>Dr. John Smith is one of the very few doctors who emphasises <A

                                <P>Since January 1997 pictures of 
                                  foreskin retraction are available on internet. It would be realistic 
                                  to print pictures of the erect penis showing the retraction of the 
                                  foreskin in books on sexual education, this would minimise the necessity 
                                  to find education through pornography.</P>

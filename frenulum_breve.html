        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                                    A small sheet of skin underneath the glans joins the glans to 
                                    the foreskin. On the erect penis if the frenulum is too short, 
                                    when one retracts the foreskin and then lets go, the foreskin 
                                    slides or springs forward again. The condition is well described

                                      <P>This condition is one of potential antagonistic pulls. During 
                                        erection the short frenulum tethers the foreskin forward, on the 
                                        other hand intercourse, and masturbation exert forces which pull 
                                        the foreskin backward. This causes a variety of pleasure/pain 
                                        sensations. The various degrees of brevity and thickness, and 
                                        infinite variations in the positioning, make it difficult to give 
                                        a simple description of the effects.</P>
                                    <P>When masturbating the erection is manually controlled, so the foreskin 
                                      can be kept in a forward position and painful movements can be avoided. 
                                      Conscious problems start during intercourse when the foreskin is involuntarily 
                                      and repeatedly pulled backwards . 
                                    <P>The strain often causes pain, soreness, and bruising for some days 
                                      afterwards, or the frenulum can rip. 
                                    <P> Ripping occurs typically during first love making often resulting 
                                      in profuse bleeding. Subsequently the bleeding surfaces can congeal 
                                      and the frenulum rejoins even shorter than previously, sometimes developing 
                                      an ulcer like scar.

                              Some men are born without a frenulum, sometimes the frenulum spreads 
                              out like the roots of a tree; often the frenulum forms one prominent 
                              ridge. This prominent frenular ridge runs from the foremost point of 
                              the shaft in the "V" shaped cleft between the two cloves underneath 
                              the glans, and runs back along the shaft and inner foreskin. A healthy 
                              frenulum allows the foreskin to retract freely when erect. (This sheet 
                              or ridge of tissue can be of any thickness. The thickness of the frenulum 
                              appears to be independent of the length.) </P>
                            <P>The frenulum itself is not very sensitive, however it is attached 
                              underneath and behind the glans and this area has a particularly abundant 
                              network of nerves. </P>

                              This is a most confusing condition, far more enigmatic than the 
                              phimotic ring. The condition is so well hidden behind the foreskin 
                              and underneath the glans, that the men themselves usually don't 
                              recognise it until well after sexual activity has started. - they 
                              frequently identify their difficulty as redundant prepuce or phimosis. 
                            <P>Public information and medical studies rarely acknowledge the condition 
                              or describe the effects inaccurately or insufficiently. In the literature 
                              there appears to be only rare indications as to what exactly the problem 
                              is which is considered as necessary to surgically correct. 
                            <P>And there are no reliable statistics - (except on beef cattle 
                              and pigs where early checks are performed for breeding soundness).

                                    A simple description of the effect of frenulum breve during erection, 
                                    is that when one retracts the foreskin and then lets go, the foreskin 
                                    slides (or springs) forward again. If one holds the foreskin back 
                                    it bends the glans downwards. The condition is well described as 
                                    a "tether" <A HREF="library/xtras/refs.html#ref80">(80)</A>, <A HREF="library/xtras/refs.html#ref81">(81)</A>, 
                                    The tethering effect of this short "bridle" holds the foreskin 
                                    forward. 
                                    <P>When masturbating, the erection is manually controlled, so the foreskin 
                                      can be kept in a forward position and painful movements can be avoided. 
                                      Though afterwards some men express a feeling of soreness and being 
                                      bruised; pain or ripping are only occasionally reported during masturbation. 
                                    <P>Generally problems occurs during intercourse. Lubrication is necessary 
                                      (e.g. the natural lubrication) or during penetration, ejaculation, 
                                      or if the vagina tightens, it will be painful as the foreskin is pulled 
                                      backwards on the frenulum. Often at these times the frenulum will rip.         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                            <P>                            
                            <P>Among men who are circumcised there is sometimes no foreskin for 
                              the tension of the short frenulum to displace, and during erection 
                              the glans bends downwards, or under this unavoidable direct strain 
                              it may rip. It has been suggested that in the circumcised state, 
                              if the frenulum does not rip this can lead to a permanent deviation 
                              of the phallus <A HREF="library/xtras/refs.html#ref82">(82)</A>. 
                            <P><B>Various Degrees of Brevity</B><BR>
                              There are various degrees of brevity. Anatomical and sexual effects 
                              are related to the thickness and shortness of the frenulum breve, 
                              and where it is positioned. 
                            <P>I believe we can define 6 different sorts of frenulum. Some men 
                              have no frenulum. When a frenulum is present, we can define 5 different 
                              lengths of frenulum<BR>
                            <UL>
                              <LI>extra long: some men have a frenulum which is so long and pleasurable 
                                that they can pull on it to acheive orgasm. 
                              <LI> adequately long: among some men it is long enough to allow 
                                easy retraction with no feeling of tension. 
                              <LI>border line: some feel it pulling during intercourse among these 
                                some complain of premature ejaculation whereas others feel without 
                                this stimulation they would not ejaculate - this could be as much 
                                due to the length of frenulum as individual psychology 
                              <LI> too short: when it is too short it will either rip or cause 
                                pain either during or after intercourse - whether it rips or not 
                                probably depends more on the thickness of the frenulum than its 
                                shortness.
                              <LI> Sometimes the frenulum is so short that there is actually no 
                                frenulum and the foreskin is attached directly to the glans, even 
                                directly underneath the meatus (the urinary opening of the glans). 
                            </UL>
                            <P>These very short degrees will presumably either totally hinder 
                              penetration or cause pain and rip when attempting this. 
                              
                            <P> It appears that with less tight degrees, if the foreskin can be 
                              retracted and penetration can be accomplished, this is more likely 
                              to cause pain or rip during ejaculation, or to cause soreness and a 
                              feeling of being bruised afterwards for a period of several days. Reports 
                              suggest that some, (presumably milder degrees or thicker frenulum), 
                              may rip eventually after several years of active sex. 
                            <P>Some men feel the frenulum pulling during intercourse; among these 
                              some complain of premature ejaculation, whereas others feel that without 
                              this stimulation they would not ejaculate. These attitudes could well 
                              be due to different lengths and positioning of frenulum rather than 
                              individual psychology. 
                            <P>Frenulo-phimotic combinations are frequent. When frenulum breve 
                              is combined with other conditions this has more complex effects. When 
                              combined with a relative phimosis it is reported latching behind the 
                              corona, creating a true spring mechanism for the foreskin.</P>
                            <P><A NAME="rips"></A><B>WHEN THE FRENULUM RIPS</B><BR>
Without any warning to the young men who have the misfortune of 
   this membrane being too short, our cultures curious tradition is, 
   several years after puberty, to let it rip of its own accord. When 
   the frenulum rips it is usually accompanied by pain and bleeding 
   - this is the most commonly reported symptom of the condition. </P>
                            <P>Dr. Porst describes the experience : &quot;Among a percentage 
                              of men... on erection it tightens to its limit, and then can even 
                              rip Furthermore, this mostly happens unsolicited, during the first 
                              sexual encounter. A moment of great alarm follows for both participants 
                              at the resultant bleeding." <A HREF="library/xtras/refs.html#ref9">(9)</A>. 
                              The Kinsey New Report say that such incidents are &quot;not unusual&quot; <A HREF="library/xtras/refs.html#ref10">(10)</A>.</P>
                            <P>Sometimes it rips on the first sexual encounter often later. When 
                              the frenulum rips, this may save years of adult problems. </P>
                            <P> Subsequently the bleeding will often congeal and the frenulum will 
                              rejoin which may make it even tighter and then it will subsequently 
                              rip again, so that the process continues ad infinitum. To add to the 
                              general frustration, occasionally an ulcer like scab can develop on 
                              the rip scar, and this may even break off when engaging in sex. 
                            <P>Whether it rips or not and if it rejoins certainly depends more 
                              on the thickness of the frenulum than its shortness. Some men have 
                              a thin frenulum breve which is typically topped with a string of skin 
                              like a hem while others have a thick sturdy frenulum. It appears that 
                              when a thick frenulum breve rips, it can rejoin, whereas a thin frenulum 
                              breve leaves such tiny flaps of skin that they can recede into the 
                              shaft skin beneath the glans. With a thin frenulum breve, once the 
                              string which forms the hem on the frenulum rips, the remaining frenulum 
                              will rip easily and naturally.</P>
                            <P>In addition, it is recognised that in old age as the skin tightens, 
                              often a frenulum which had previously caused no apparent problem 
                              can start to cause tension, and sometimes it may rip, or require 
                              an operation. </P>
                            <P>The ripping of the frenulum is a far more common fate of the frenulum 
                              breve than an operation. - My personal interviews among 300 people 
                              showed from around eight cases of ripping, that only two had informed 
                              their doctors - (largely because it healed almost straight away) 
                              There is therefore good reason to believe that frenular rips are 
                              occurring at a far greater frequency than the medical profession 
                              realises.</P>

                              One woman described a man who was always soft inside her until ejaculation 
                              when it hurt him, he was aware that the frenulum caused this pain, 
                              he was apparently not aware of the weakness of his erection. One 
                              man who was aware of the frenulum being too tight, advised his girlfriends 
                              not to touch him there, a simple practical idea, except that it 
                              made him to some extent untouchable. Neither of these men had realised 
                              that there was a cure.</P>
                            <P>Because of the overall impression that the foreskin remains forward, 
                              there is a tendency similar to phimosis for the adolescent to forget 
                              to wash the area.</P>
                            <P>Incidentally because of the antagonistic pulls involved this condition 
                              is especially problematic when trying to use a condom         </TD></TR></TABLE></TD>

        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                                  Phimosis: is circumcision necessary?<BR>
  <I>J Paediatr Child Health 1996 Aug;32(4):285-9</I><BR>
  &quot;... circumcision is the ... most performed surgical procedure 
                                  in the world. ... The most common stated medical indication for circumcision 
                                  is phimosis, however, the definition of this condition is obscure in 
                                  most publications ... Little is known or written about the aetology 
                                  of true phimosis, despite the supposed frequency varying from 4 to 
                                  10%. ... &quot; 
                                <P>AM Rickwood et al<BR>
                                  Phimosis in boys.<BR>
  <I>Br J Urol 1980 Apr;52(2):147-50</I><BR>
  &quot;Little is known of this condition. ... Its natural history is 
                                  unknown and its histological features have not been described. ... 
                                  Its aetology remains obscure.&quot;</P>

                                  Phimosis and Diabetes Mellitus.<BR>
  <I>J Urol 1982 Jun;127(6):1101-2</I><BR>
  &quot;No description of the histologic examinations of phimotic foreskins 
                                  was found in the literature.&quot;</P>
                                <P>OJ. Clemmensen et al<BR>
                                  The histologic spectrum of prepuces from patients with phimosis.<BR>
  <I>Am J Dermatopathol 1988 Apr;10(2):104-8</I><BR>
  &quot;The lesion usually affects the inner blade of the prepuce, leaving 
                                  for direct examination only a nonretractable prepuce with a conspicuous 
                                  distal stenosis. The glans penis may or may not be affected, but it 
                                  is often inaccessible for inspection due to the preputial stenosis. 
                                  Therefore, circumcision for phimosis is often performed without primary 
                                  knowledge of the nature of the underlying pathologic condition.&quot;</P>

                                  It is as unbelievable as it is true that the most accurate physical 
                                  description to date of a phimotic ring comes from a study of 21 or 
                                  22 corpses, In 1996 the British Journal of Urology published the study 
                                  written by a supporter of the anti routine circumcision movement who 
                                  was in fact attempting to show the value of the foreskin . He describes 
                                  the exact position of the phimotic ring and explains that "the richly 
                                  innervated nature of the 'ridged band'" is a valuable part of the normal 
                                  foreskin. (<A HREF="phimosis_studies.html#curiosities">see Phimosis

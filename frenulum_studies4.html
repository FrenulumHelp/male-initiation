        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

"In the case of a short frenulum, by which the glans of the penis is 
drawn crooked during erection, emission is made difficult"
<P>"The boy ... experiences a disappointement, he thought the foreskin 
  ...would retract further and notices now that the frenulum ... stops 
  any further retraction. The idea occurs to him to cut through the frenulum. 
  Perhaps as well he had previously heard from his fellow sufferers that 
  due to its shortness it can sometimes rips during the sexual act. <BR>
  The Kayapo wear a cap, which they fasten onto the prepuce, after they 
  have cut through the frenulum with a taqua splinter. (Kissenberth after 
  Koch, p.110).<BR>
  In the literature, cases of severing of the frenulum are known to me 
  among the inhabitants of the Loyalty Islands (Sarasin) and, as just 
  mentioned, among the Tahitians."</P>

    <TD WIDTH="66%"> The Okoko is the male soldier ant. ... The Okoko would 
      then be caught and its incisor like proboscis placed squarely on the 
      connective tissue that joins the penial foreskin to the male organ. 
      The Okoko would then tighten grip to sever through the connective tissue 
      ... the Okoko could cling to the connective tissue and take its time 
      about severing it.&quot;         </TD></TR></TABLE>
<P> "The Wino Method (Flywhisk Method)<BR>
  In this flywhisk strand method, the operation procedure involved the 
  presence of a thorn known as Kuth Alak Tar and one long strand from 
  a flywhisk called Wino. ... The thorn is first used to pierce through 
  the connective tissue joining the foreskin to the male organ. As the 
  thorn pierces further, blood drips from the mutilated part. The Wino 
  is then passed through the opening made by the thorn, and knotted tightly 
  round the circumference of the tissue. ... &quot; 
<P>&quot;The knotted strand would slowly cut through the tissue overnight 
  after two days, or more, depending on the individuals.... unmelted 
  animal ghee known as Mor-Dhiang' is applied to the connective tissue 
  as long as it is knotted. The application of this ghee is thought to 
  act as the modern petroleum jelly substitute, to render the connective 
  tissue soft to accelerate the severing process of the knotted flywhisk 
  strand." </P>
<P> "The Opila Method (Sugarcane Rind Method)<BR>
  In some different parts of Luoland, the sheath-like cover of the millet 
  stalk was widely preferred to than that of sugar cane. ... In the Opila 
  method the thorn Kuth Alaktar was first used to pierce through the 
  connective tissue of the male organ. But before the thorn could be 
  pulled out, the sharp blade is used to incise through up to the thorn. 
  The thorn was therefore an anvil on which the blade of the Opila stopped 
  in order to avoid hideous mutilation of the male organ." </P>
<P> "Tuchruok Method (The Piercing Method)<BR>
  In both the Wino and the Opila methods, the thorn was used in preparation 
  while in the Tuchruok method, it is the only tool used. ... The thorn 
  is used to pierce through the Onduong. Since the hind part of the thorn 
  is generally larger than the fore part, the sharp part is pushed further, 
  thereby widening the 'opening'. The widening process continues until 
  the Onduong is finally severed." </P>
<P><I>One usefulness of this custom is clearly</I><BR>
  "... During the Ndaria girls from the nearly married girl's (Miaha) 
  village arrives at the home where the Miaha is married. This was for 
  the purpose of witnessing the Ndaria and also to return back with one 
  of the bloody beddings as evidence of the Miaha's freshness and virginity. 
  During this occasion, the hymen of the virgin is broken." </P>
<P> "In this case, if Ridhruok and the other methods were not observed 
  by the man, the narrow hymen of the girl performs the act. This causes 
  the bleeding of both the man and the girl, which is diametrically opposed 
  to the purpose of the Ndaria which sought to prove the virginity of 
  the new wife, but not the uncircumcised condition of the husband. For 
  the husband to prove that he too was uncircumcised on the bridal bed 
  was a stigma that could stick on his personality for the rest of his 
  life." </P>
<P> "Such accidents have been known to break the Onduong by force during 
  the breaking of the virginity."

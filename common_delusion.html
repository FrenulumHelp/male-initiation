        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                            <P>This page discusses the condition of frenulum breve 
                              of the penis. Its effects have apparently never been accurately described 
                              or fully understood.</P>
                            <P>A psychologist at the Institute of Sexual Research in Hamburg 
                              was of the opinion that any sexual effects from the frenulum breve 
                              were a delusion. He added &quot;Do you realise how many patients 
                              I have seen that have had their frenulum removed because they 
                              thought this was the cause of their difficulties&quot;. (<A HREF="library/surround/psychologist_repression.html#hamburg">story 
                                continues</A>)</P>
                            <P>Psychologists could note: - if such experiences are to be understood 
                              as delusions, and many other men have had similar fantasies,... then 
                              it must, at least, be understood as a common delusion.</P>

                        <P>In 1779 <A HREF="anthropology/diderot_eng.html#start">Diderot</A> wrote<I> -</I> &quot;Its 
                          extreme sensitivity shows that it must be covered with a quantity 
                          of nervous papillae; & perhaps for these reasons it merits more 
                          attention on behalf of the anatomists than they have given it up 
                          until present;&quot; - In 1958 <A HREF="library/medicus/grewel.html#start">Grewel</A> wrote "It cannot be masculine pride alone ... which has caused the 
                          phenomenon to be neglected by male physicians and psychoanalysts, 
                          ... resulting in a general or collective repression of the phenomenon." 
                          Though he was referring principally to frenular rips, modern medical 
                          literature (<I>Pienkos, Whelan</I>) confirms that "The existence 
                          of a short frenulum is noted in few urological text books." (<I>Whelan</I>)</P>
                        <P>Medical, sexual or public information rarely acknowledge the condition. 
                          There are no statistics except on <a href="frenulum_studies5.html#start">beef cattle and pigs</a>. There are 
                          even a small collection of studies concerned with the early prevention of such problems among farm animals. Perhaps 
                          this is because "Copulation failure in food animals can be economically 
                          devastating to producers." (<I>G. St Jean</I>) </P>

                        <P>Thus, the usual description of this short membrane, in practical use 
                          by specialists and even in some medical texts, is that it causes 
                          the glans to bend downward. </P>
                        <P>Recent specialised medical texts suggest that it is the curvature 
                          of the glans which causes pain (<I>Chitale, Whelan,</I>). It appears 
                          the distortion of the bending phallus and glans is so shocking that 
                          some doctors speculate that this is the origin of the pain, without 
                          ever asking the patients concerned.- <B>It is in fact the tension 
                            of the frenulum pulling on the glans which hurts, and not the bending 
                            glans.</B></P>
                        <P>___________________ </P>
                        <P> Men who have this condition often do not understand it themselves. 
                        <P> Anatomically speaking this is a most devious condition. To visually identify a frenulum breve when erect, 
                          involves the carrier in what are to him unnatural contortions. 
                        <P>If the 
                          frenulum is too short it pulls the foreskin forward, therefore it is 
                          hidden underneath and behind the foreskin.</P>
                        <P>When the penis is erect, to hold the foreskin backwards creates 
                          a feeling of tension. To hold the foreskin retracted, endure the tension 
                          and then turn the phallus in order to be able to look sidewards at 
                          this curious spring structure, is a contortion which Houdini would 
                          have been proud of.</P>
                        <P>Due to the difficulty involved for the carrier in identifying his 
                          own condition, (and the almost complete lack of accurate information 
                          or education on the condition and its treatment), men often feel pain 
                          or discomfort without realising its cause. 
                        <P>If the problem is recognised its nature is often interpreted incorrectly 
                          and can result in false impressions such as the redundant prepuce <I>(Swartz)</I>.or 
                          "there's too much skin" or "it just gets in the way all the time" (<I><A HREF="letters.html#start">private 
                            mail</A></I>). Often merely on the basis of the frustration this causes, 
                          circumcision is requested. 
                        <P>___________________ 
                        <P>With retraction of the foreskin always hurting and the foreskin 
                          sliding forward again, the subject sees the repeated recovering 
                          of the glans as unsuccessful, disappointing , frustrating, ... depending 
                          on sexual attitudes and education its could be experienced as something 
                          which isn`t meant to be done, or even something which it is wrong 
                          to do ... (compare this with phimotic ring where the foreskin simply 
                          can not be retracted, it cant be done, there`s no question about 
                          right or wrong - possibly there are similarities here between all 
                          the conditions which cause pain: fr. br., relative phimosis, skinbridges.)
                        <P>___________________ 
                        <P><B>The Delsuion is confirmed.</B>
                        <P>Urologists assume that the frenulum breve starts causing pain 
                          or difficulty first as an adult during sexual intercourse and previously 
                          it had been no problem, - they are unaware that the patient has 
                          avoided this pain during masturbation throughout his development 
                          years. Deeper questioning seems inappropriate probably out of tact 
                          and simply because it's not the urologists job to understand and 
                          counsell on psychosexual problems. Accordingly urologists are unaware 
                          of any long term sexual problem. 
                        <P>It is not suprising that many men go to the psychologists ... 
                          however here the patient will be further confused; the psychologal 
                          literature contains little reference (only Grewel) to the idea that 
                          an anatomical malformation of the prepuce could have a psychosexual 
                          effect - The psychologists approach is that psychosexual problems 
                          are based on parental and early environmental influences.

                            </B>So it is clear that someone here is under a delusion:- Grewel 
                          and I maintain it is the medical profession and the psychologists; 
                          and they maintain it is men who think they have sexual problems due to frenulum 
                        breve. Whichever way, it is a common delusion.         </TD></TR></TABLE></TD>

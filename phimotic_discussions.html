        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                                as the Origin of the Practice of Routine Male Circumcision </B>
                              <P>Most of the anthropological literature on circumcision shows no awareness 
                                  of the problems  with phimosis which can be cured by this archaic form 
                                  of surgery.
                              (see <A HREF="phimosis_history.html#start">Phimosis Through the Ages</A>). 
                              <P>Even our present day Western medical literature shows little awareness of sexual problems 
                                  due to phimosis. The extent and diversity of the sexual difficulties 
                                  from phimosis have only recently reached the light of day, 
                                  largely due to the anonymity of Internet where adult men have been 
                                  able to record their experiences openly for the first time, (see &quot;<A HREF="passages.html#start">Passages 
                                    to Manhood</A>&quot;). Thus inevitably, our anthropologists have been 
                                  largely unaware of the sexual consequences of these conditions. 
                              <P>The only anthropologists who showed any understanding of foreskin 
                                  conditions and their various disorienting effects were Bryk and Ploss.
                              <P><B>Ploss - Phimosis and the Fertility</B> <B>misinterpretation </B><BR>
                                In 1884 <A HREF="ploss.html#start">Ploss</A> wrote &quot;Das Kind&quot; 
                              (The Child). 
                              He died in 1885 and was unable to defend against a misinterpretation of his ideas. 
                              
                              <P>He concludes the Jewish practice was due to thoughts of ensuring offspring and numerous posterity, 
  and he backs this up with Bible quotes, (and an awareness of fertility would be expected among such an advanced 
  literate people).
                              <P>When he talks of natural peoples Ploss discusses the 
                                normal appearance of the adult penis and the questionable or worrying <I>appearance</I> of infant phimosis. He talks 
                                of phimosis "causing difficulties during sexual activity", "as being 
                                more or less an obstacle to coitus", even that circumcision occurred 
                                at an age preparing for merely "the enjoyment of sex" ... &quot;which 
                              prepares for sexual adulthood&quot;. Among the natural peoples he suggests fertility as only one of many considerations.
                              
                              <P>The anthropologists who discussed Plosses theory interpret him as 
                              saying that circumcision was introduced because phimosis hinders fertility. Some supported this, others rejected it. However it is doubtful whether he would have agreed with this narrow interpretation.
                              <P>Ploss showed no specific awareness of any of the actual practical difficulties with foreskin conditions. But possibly he would have argued the <EM>apparent</EM> hindrance to sexual enjoyment.                               
                              <P>Eventually this theory was conclusively rebutted by the fact that <A HREF="anthropology/fertility.html#start">hunting 
                                peoples had no idea of the causal sequence leading to fertility</A>. but                                                           
                                to therefore deduce that phimosis was not relevant 
                                to the origins of the practice is illogical. 
                                What 
                                about the other effects of phimosis which Ploss refers us to?
                              <P>Actually one imagines fertility was far more 
                                the motivation for sex in the 1880s - among hunting peoples enjoyment 
                                of sex was probably the most significant motive!
                              <P>The fact remains that the argument concerning fertility is the only argument against 
                                Ploss in the entire literature on this subject.
                              <P><B>Bryk and Statistics</B>

                                The degrees of phimosis which cause pain during sex do not restrict 
                                urination. (see <A HREF="phimosis_summary.html#start">Phimosis</A>)--- Concerning the frenulum he writes "by which the glans 
                                of the penis is drawn crooked during erection, ejaculation is made 
                                more difficult". (see <A HREF="frenulum_breve.html#start">Frenulum</A>)                              </P>
                              <P>Bryk discusses at great length the &quot;foreskin complex&quot; 
                              as though this were a general problem with foreskins, with mysterious disconnected symptoms however, he fails 
                              to identify the symptoms of frenulum

                              <P>Perhaps simply because he accepts phimosis as a rarity, he adopts his term &quot;the foreskin complex&quot; to indicate all the cumulative problems inherant in foreskins.

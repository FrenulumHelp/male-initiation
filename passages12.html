        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                  myself saw 2 psychologists about sexual dysfunction previous to my 
                  own discovery of the physical problem. I had discussed anatomical symptoms 
                  of masturbating in an abnormal manner. This should have been an obvious 
                    symptom for anyone who has studied problems in male 
                    sexuality. An awareness of the symptoms related to foreskin conditions 
                    would truly be desirable among therapists, particularly those dealing 
                    with problems in sexual and relating behaviour.
                            <P><I><A HREF="library/passages/verruckt-werden.html#start">e.g.37</A></I> "My sexual life is non-existant, and that at the age of 30 .. I truly 
                              wanted to get myself castrated, but I havent got the nerve. So, I can 
                              fully confirm for you, that in my experience, the anatomical problem 
                              can lead to enormous psychological disturbances, and these can be far 
                              far worse than the original problem!"

                                        at last, I was a man. I could have sex. But hang on, where was all 
                                        the youthful experimentation and the social skills. How could I ever 
                                        find anyone who would put up with an emotionally retarded man of 26. 
                                        ... I had suffered for nothing, and I was swamped with guilt and anger. 
                                        I could not shake the feeling that I was different. ... Years passed. 
                                        I was still untouched, ..... at the age of 33, I lost my virginity.

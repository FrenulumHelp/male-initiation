This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest. In the immediate future, health care with self-education through internet is obvious - please see <a href="postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.

welcome

With our culture`s attitudes towards early health care, it would be appropriate to educate boys about phimosis and when possible, routinely examine boys foreskins and prevent or treat any individual problems in good time, before puberty. 

This site promotes
Education and Monitoring Boys for Phimosis before Puberty 

Unserer fürsorglichen modernen Auffassung von gesundheitlicher Vorsorge entspräche es, Jungen routinemäßig zu untersuchen, um individuelle Probleme frühzeitig - noch vor der Pubertät - zu erkennen, gegebenenfalls vorzubeugen oder zu behandeln.

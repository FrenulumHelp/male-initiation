        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                    out with a girl and realized that something was different with my penis. 
                    We were fooling around in bed and I was shocked to discover that the 
                    head of my penis was completely exposed due to a severe erection. This 
                    had never happened before and shocked me so much that it put an end 
                    to our intimate moment. I had always thought that the foreskin should 
                    always cover the entire penis, even during sex.                  
                            <P>&quot;I have experimented with trying to retract the foreskin and 
                              it feels very unatural and even a bit painful. I have not gotten past 
                              half my glands and feel resistance at that point. Could this be due 
                              to fear more than a physical disorder?" - (<I>RS Here we see the sufferer 
                                himself questioning if there could be a psychological basis for his 
                                fear of retraction - well if so, I feel this would be justifyable and 
                                sensible<I>:</I> anatomically his condition produces paraphimosis. 
                                he continues-)</I> </P>
                            <P>"I also grew up thinking that I was normal. ... I would never even 
                              wash myself properly thinking that my glands should never be touched 
                              (sort of like eyeballs). My first and only experience with a woman 
                              was so traumatic that I thought that I was not meant to have intercourse."

                  say that all my problems are related to the fact that my foreskin is 
                  too tight (even tough I'm pretty sure they are). ... I dont feel any 
                  pain at times of erection, but I feel a big discomfort when there is 
                    pressure to retract the foreskin. .... During the experiences I had, 
                    some were relatively painless, even though I could feel a certain discomfort 
                    for hours after. Some other experiences were more painful. ... The 
                    problem had big psychological repercussions. I experienced a big lack 
                    of self confidence and self esteem."
                            <P>One case history is briefly reported by Bryk, an anthropologist. 
                                      He writes &quot;the entire schizoid inferiority complex of a young 
                                      man, could be traced to his inability to manually uncover his glans.&quot; 
                                      The young man &quot;suffered from a congenital phimosis, which he 
                                      unfortunately recognised too late,&quot; <A HREF="library/xtras/refs.html#ref15">(ref.

                                    <P>A psychologist at the Institute of Sexual Research in Hamburg (<I><A HREF="library/surround/psychologist_repression.html#start">details of this interview</A></I>) informed me 
                                      that they have seen many men who believed that their frenulum breve 
                                      condition was the cause of their sexual disturbances. Why do so 
                                      many men consult the psychologist instead of the Urologist? The 
                                      men themselves must believe that they have a psychological problem, 
                                      indeed after so many years neglected anatomical pain or difficulty, 
                                      it could be expected that this has an effect on the psychological 
                                      development of any man.

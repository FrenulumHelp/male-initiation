        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                                  of 8.8%</A> relates to phimosis visible when flaccid, among young men. 
                                  In order to arrive at a realistic figure, we must add</P>
                                <P>5% who develop a phimosis during adulthood. (considerably more in 
                                  old age) <BR>
                                  2% frenulum.<BR>
                                  2% pain and difficulty inherent in some tensions and degrees of phimosis 
                                  which are not visible when flaccid.</P>
                                <P>Half the (personal opinion of 4%) frenulum cases occur with, and 
                                  are included in the phimosis figures.<BR>
                                  Skin bridges (in uncircumcised boys) also appear to occur mostly together 
                                  with phimotic ring<BR>
                                  Diseases and infections are also largely covered in these figures, 
                                  (undeveloped foreskin, --&gt; no natural retraction,--&gt; uncleanliness).</P>

                           <P><B>How to arrive at Realistic Statistics</B>.<BR>
What would give us really realistic statistics would be a survey on 
a group of men who were 80 yrs. old and over. Most older men will not 
be concerned about the social stigma and thus more likely to tell the 
truth, especially when they learn that by recording their experience 
it could help youngsters. Maybe with the skin shrinkage, by the time 
a man is 100 yrs. old, practically every male needs a surgical correction... 
? It would be interesting to make a test survey on a group of old age 
pensioners. How many were circumcised, when, why... and remember to 
ask if they consider retraction necessary ...
                           <P><B>Extra Points about Statistics</B><BR>
                             I believe the total figure is at least 12.5% not because of the medical 
                             studies, but simply because of the men I have talked with. I have talked 
                             personally with around 40 cases, and have questioned not more than 
                             250 men; (I have certainly not had the opportunity to speak with 4,000 
                             men!)</P>
                           <P>I realise such personally collected statistics are scientifically 
                             invalid; All one really needs to say is &quot;If the statistics were 
                             only 1%, this would be too many&quot;. I believe, if parents were aware 
                             of a 1% chance they would want to check their children. I have never 
                             seen any valid source references for a 1% figure. (The lowest recorded 
                             statistic, is &Oslash;ster with 2.4% and this was recorded after seven 
                             years of annual check-ups and education).</P>         </TD></TR></TABLE></TD>

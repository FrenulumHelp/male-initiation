        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                                <P><B>1.</B> An important question for many people is whether routine 
                                  male circumcision should be practised or not. ... In the modern 
                                  world, the routine circumcision of boys and even infants who have 
                                  nothing wrong with them, seems pointless. </P>
                                <P>In an information centred culture it would be much more appropriate 
                                  to routinely check all boys to determine whether a boy had any problems, 
                                  and if so which sort of individual treatment he required. </P>
                                <P>The real problem is actually getting the question right - not 
                                  the answer! </P>
                                <P>The <A HREF="debate.html#start">anti. pro. circumcision debate</A>, 
                                  is the singular most destructive factor to clear thinking about 
                                  circumcision. It misleads the listener to believe there are only 
                                  two options, - and only one answer which applies to every boy.</P>
                                <P>I want to help bring the treatment of phimosis out of the "preliterate" 
                                  times of habitual and one dimensional thinking where either everyone 
                                  or no-one is circumcised ... phimotic minded - routine thinking ... 
                                  can we stretch the imagination a little please ... </P>

                                <P><B>2.</B> RIC - Routine Infant Circumcision, in its present form 
                                  in the modern USA, is idiotic. The foreskin is removed in earliest 
                                  infancy often even before the mother has held her baby. What a ridiculous 
                                  example of modern medicine, especially for the (presently considered) 
                                  most advanced country of the world, where they are developing gene 
                                  technology etc.. 
                                <P>Not only the pain of an often not anaesthetised operation, (which 
                                  obviously a baby wont consciously remember, but babies are sensitive 
                                  and they certainly experience this and experiences form impressions 
                                  and impressions develop into attitudes), but also this traumatising 
                                  operation was inevitably followed by the after effects of a burning 
                                  soreness from a hyper sensitive glans for some weeks or months, 
                                  slowly diminishing in pain until now in adulthood the glans has 
                                  become hardened and sometimes insensitive. 
                                <P>In addition the operation is often performed carelessly, frequently 
                                  by student doctors, and normally with no post operative check up 
                                  - skin bridges are a common result. The infant trauma of an intrusion 
                                  in a natural developing process, leaving post operative problems 
                                  which otherwise would not have existed is a truly irrational experience. 
                                  One can appreciate the vehemence of opposition to such a procedure. 
                                <P>Compare this to the traditional Jewish circumcision which cut only 
                                  the tip of the foreskin off, and left the epithelial adhesions to loosen 
                                  themselves from the glans over the following year or so. 
                                <P>In my opinion Abraham acted with care and intelligence when 4 to 
                                  5 thousand years ago he introduced this form of partial circumcision 
                                  for Jewish babies on the 8th. day. But this has become cold and clinical 
                                  in its modern form in the USA with no cultural recognition or celebration 
                                  - just another method of ignoring or repressing foreskins - (at least 
                                  the Jewish boy has a party day). 
                                <P> Without information, preventative health care and modern anaesthetic 
                                  I find the Jewish approach is the most appropriate, however, in 
                                  these modern enlightened times preventative health care means routine 
                                  monitoring and education.

                                <P>New research could reveal <A HREF="dissolve.html#start">a solution 
                                  for adhesions</A>.</P>
                                <P>And <B>: </B>How often does phimosis occurr in old age? </P>
                                <P>I often hear from nurses in old peoples homes, I recently talked 
                                  with another - and I always hear that pratically every male is either 
                                  circumcised or phimotic. Washing these men is apparently the nastiest 
                                  job they have. </P>
                                <P>Urologists and Surgeons have told me, regarding both frenuloplasty 
                                  and circumcision, that they operate mostly during puberty, and then 
                                  in old age. Perhaps the most striking evidence is that in Germany 
                                  this phenomenon has a name : "Alters phimose" (old-age phimosis) 
                                  - it is so common that they have named it! The only scientific indication 
                                  could come from Taylors study on 22 corpses, all of whom 
                                  had phimotic ring. From 5 case histories I know, this fibrotic ring 
                                  develops between 70 and 76 yrs. old </P>
                                <P>I would like to e.mail 100 or so medical faculties with the following 
                                  idea for final year medical students - they always want original 
                                  research projects for diploma work : A first test statistical study 
                                  of 100 male OAPs is needed. </P>

                                <P><B>4.</B> Individual problem related specific treatment is an 
                                  expected medical standard in our culture, (the statistics are irrelevant, 
                                  even if its 80% with problems - today's medicine normally monitors 
                                  and then treats problems specifically). </P>
                                <P>Routine operations or ignoring problems are simply not appropriate 
                                  attitudes for modern medicine, ... you name it; modern medicine 
                                  checks it, and intervenes only when there is a problem - except 
                                  when this concerns boys foreskin. </P>
                                <P>Future generations will certainly develop a completely new approach 
                                  and attitude to medicine and health. They might even consider routinely 
                                  gene manipulated body parts as appropriate. This is not important 
                                  to me, what is important and ridiculous to me, is it looks like we will have gene 
                                  manipulated hands noses and hair, but there will still be a debate 
                                  going on pro and anti routine circumcision. </P>
                                <P>Ultimately I want the circumcision and phimosis taboos to be broken so that 
                                  the foreskin is treated by modern medicine with the same care, thought 
                                  and respect as every other part of the human body, and at present 
                                  to me, this means ....                                </P>

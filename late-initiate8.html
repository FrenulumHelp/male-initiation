        <P><FONT SIZE="2">The concept that an anatomical deficiency in the erection can influence the 
  sexuality appears to contradict every advance in understanding which our culture 
  has made over the last century. - Psychological research has concentrated on parental 
          and environmental phenomenon, and the urological disciplines do not 
          include sexual behaviour. Scientific research has overlooked this area 
          of human sexuality. </FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                          <TD><P>If he does not sublimate his sexual drive, it leaves him with something 
                              impossible to prove or fulfil. He compensates his reality with fantasy 
                              opening the door to further disillusion and a life chasing beautiful 
                              unreality, (with wishes which he subsequently attempts to fulfil in 
                              his real relationships).
                            
                          <P>It is worth considering that in specific cases where foreskin 
                    conditions were combined with a particularly unstable and disturbing 
                    upbringing they could easily add another ingredient to the irrational 
                    frustration which leads to specific sexual crimes, this particularly 
                    concerns the frequent profile of rape without penetration, but also 
                    those forms of pedophile behaviour which do not involve direct sexual 
                    contact.
                  
                            <P>Sexual offenders should undoubtedly be carefully and compassionately 
                              monitored for foreskin difficulties, however I suspect that more commonly 
                              sufferers end up in a domina`s dungeon, rather than the State prison. 
                            <P>With time, when the inadequacy in intimate relationships reflects 
                              socially, this will add another ingredient to the severity of any social 
                              problem, with consequences which are recognised among the socially 
                              isolated, e.g. homelessness, drug addiction, suicide. 
                            <P>(For clarification: I am obviously not arguing that 
                              the entire psychology and character development of a youth has evolved 
                              exclusively based on one anatomical problem. As with any other disturbing 
                              influence the effects will be relative to and influenced by all the 
                              other experiences in life. It would not be the only influence; - but 
                              in an integrated personality an unrecognised foreskin condition would 
                              have an influence on everything else, magnifying influences of a similar 
                              nature and undermining potentially healthy tendencies. It would combine 
                              as contributing factor in any more complex disturbance.) 
                            <P>Foreskin conditions hinder experiment, expression and satisfaction 
                              in the physical expression of love. Love making is not as physically 
                              easy or natural as it could be, it is inhibited, therefore the man 
                              might start making love later, more seldomly, or possibly not at all. 
                            <P>However, it is not only the pure feelings of love which are undermined, 
                              for the unsaintly among us, desire is a stronger force which 
                              can be extremely destructive when frustrated. We are discussing a man 
                              who`s sexuality is disoriented at a very elementary level and ultimately 
                              everything sexual is a little distorted, everything from using 
                              condoms to the Oedipus complex.
                            <P>

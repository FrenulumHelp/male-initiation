        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                            <P>Please help us establish the &quot;normal&quot; boundaries of the 
                              frenulums anatomy - how short does a frenulum have to be, to be 
                              diagnosed frenulum breve? 
                            <P>At present even those boys with a frenulum which could be diagnosed 
                              before puberty as being painful during erection, will not get treatment 
                              until after the youth starts to complain of pain, which may be as late 
                              as adulthood.</P>
                               <P>The practical problem is that pain is experienced on the erect 
                                 penis, however doctors can only monitor the flaccid penis. We need 
                                 to know which effects on the erect penis are caused by which degrees 
                                 of brevity on the flaccid penis. </P>
                               <P><STRONG>Most valuable and even essential - for research and to inform a medical profession about which frenulum types result in which erectile deformities </STRONG>(for my diagnosis as well).<STRONG> We need pictures of the flaccid penis of your frenulum from underneath the glans,  
                                 and a picture sidewards with the foreskin retracted (ie. what a doctor sees)  
                                 and then a picture sidewards of the erect 
                                 penis (all pictures with foreskin retracted). Obviously a basic description of the erectile effects  and any extra info or pictures would be welcome and 
                                 helpful.</STRONG></P>
                               <P>Doctors would then be able to advise parents and children of the 
                                 potential problems, whether the frenulum will inevitably be painful 
                                 or rip; or whether it is a borderline case; or indeed if this is 
                                 safe and normal; or maybe even one of those lucky lengths which 
                                 will provide extra pleasure.

                               <P>Frenulum Breve depends on the interplay between frenulum and foreskin 
                                 while the penis is erect. The structure of the frenulum is also 
                                 important as this influences whether it may rip.</P>
                               <P>Unfortunately there are neither comparative nor statistical studies 
                                 on the frenulum and its relationship with the foreskin. Thus there 
                                 is currently no true medical knowledge neither about the anatomical 
                                 norm nor about the anatomic boundaries within which the interplay 
                                 of frenulum and foreskin is a normal and unproblematic one. </P>
                               <P>There are a lot of important questions still unanswered:<BR>
                               </P>
                               <P>The scope of this questionnaire is to distinguish which lengths 
                                 and structures have which effects 
                               <P>Although the list of queries below seems already too long, it 
                                 may still be incomplete and thus not include some aspect of a particular 
                                 type of frenulum, but since this kind of study has never been done 
                                 before no-one knows what the outcome will be. If you come across 
                                 a question which doesn&rsquo;t include your case please feel free to write 
                                 us any additional remarks.</P>
                               <P>Please help provide information which will serve as guidelines 
                                 for further scientific enquiry. </P>
                               <P>Answer on a separate page. To help you fill in the question form, 
                                 here is a picture of the anatomy of the penis with the names of 
                                 its parts. Several questions are also accompanied by pictures so 
                                 you know what is meant by each answer possibility.</P>

                                 is to hold the glans between thumb and forefinger of your left hand, 
                                 turn it around so you can see its underside and gently move the 
                                 frenulum from one side to the other so that it stretches slightly 
                                 sideways and you actually can see where it exactly starts. Although 
                                 it makes no difference if you asses this point when your penis is 
                                 flaccid or erect, the latter may facilitate assessment. </P>

                                 itself to the foreskin or to the shaft of the penis. In order to 
                                 assess this first pull your foreskin back down the shaft of the 
                                 penis, preferably in its erect state, so that the frenulum is a 
                                 bit overstretched and tense and turns whitish. Look for the point 
                                 where the frenulum splits up like a root into three or more branches, 
                                 and thus goes over into the foreskin. If you are able to completely 
                                 retract your foreskin on the shaft of the penis you may not see 
                                 any branching out or splicing of the frenulum at all. The frenulum 
                                 just smoothly goes over into the raphe. None the less, even in this 
                                 case there is usually a definite point where the frenulum stops 
                                 having its whitish appearance and completely looses its prominence.</P>

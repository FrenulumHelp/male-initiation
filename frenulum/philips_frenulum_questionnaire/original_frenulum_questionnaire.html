          <TD><P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
            restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
            our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
            boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br>
            <BR>
            2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P></TD>

  <p>This was Philips original questionnaire with extra pictures, (my comments in Italics)<br>
    <a href="frenulum query.html#start">Back to Editted Version</a> <br>
  </p>
</CENTER>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Please help us establish the &quot;normal&quot; boundaries of the frenulums 
  anatomy - how short does a frenulum have to be, to be diagnosed frenulum breve? 
</P>
<P>Unfortunately there are neither comparative nor statistical studies on the 
  frenulum and its relationship with the foreskin. Thus there is currently no 
  true medical knowledge neither about the anatomical norm nor about the anatomic 
  boundaries within which the interplay of frenulum and foreskin is a normal and 
  unproblematic one. </P>
<P>At present even those boys with a frenulum which could be diagnosed before 
  puberty as being painful during erection, will not get treatment until after 
  the youth starts to complain of pain, which may be as late as adulthood.</P>
<P><B>The practical problem is that pain is experienced on the erect penis, however 
  doctors can only monitor the flaccid penis. We need to know which effects on 
  the erect penis - are caused by which degrees of brevity on the flaccid penis.</B></P>
<P>At present we would like to hear from any man with an intact frenulum whether 
  circumcised or not. Firstly if you have web cam facilities, we need a basic 
  description of the erectile effects and a picture sidewards and from underneath 
  of the flaccid penis (i.e. what the doctor would see). </P>
<P>Doctors will then be able to advise parents and children of the potential problems, 
  whether this is &quot;normal&quot;, whether the frenulum will inevitably be 
  painful or rip or whether it is a borderline case. 
<P>In order to provide information which will serve as guidelines for further 
  scientific enquiry please answer on a separate page : 1-24 2-Germany 3- anglo-saxon 
  etc.
<P><B>1.</B> <B>Age</B></P>
<P><B>2. Nationality</B> i.e. ethnic provenience ( If you happen to be a mixture 
  of various ethnic origins, please name them and write in parenthesis after each 
  one their respective precentage)</P>
<P><I>do you mean province? or provenance - no-one understands the word ... question 
  2 and 3 ??? surely we need to know 2. Nationality: the nation where you grew 
  up and live now. 3. The Race or ethnic origins ( If you happen to be a mixture 
  of various ethnic origins, please name them and write in parenthesis after each 
  one their respective precentage)</I></P>
<P><B>3. Race</B></P>
<P>a - Caucasian<BR>
  b - Asian<BR>
  c - Negroid<BR>
  d - Old Mixture - Turkmene<BR>
  e - Old Mixture - Aethiopian<BR>
  f - Newer Mixtures - mulatto, mestizo, etc (Please state what!)</P>
<P><B>4. Penis status</B></P>
<P>a - I was never operated on the penis. <I>------CUT as a whole</I><BR>
  b - I was operated on the penis due to ... (state the reason)</P>
<P><B>5. Foreskin status</B></P>
<P>a - My foreskin is intact<BR>
  b - My foreskin is intact, but I went through a stretching <I>scheme = programme 
  is the word you want</I><BR>
  c - I had a preputioplasty i. e. several small parallel incisions which were 
  then sewed vertically or Z-plasty or Y-plasty<BR>
  d - I had a dorsal slit<BR>
  e - Low and loose circumcision<BR>
  f - Low and tight circumcision<BR>
  g - High and loose circumcision<BR>
  h - High and tight circumcision</P>
<P><I>even I dont clearly understand the difference between e,f,g, and h, - there 
  is a drawing which indicates the difference at circlist - should be a link actually 
  on my pages but there isn`t - I think if this question is being asked we should 
  establish a link to the information </I></P>
<P><I>I think we want to discuss personally with anyone who was circumcised who 
  still has a short frenulum - it is such a rarity - I think with any of these 
  operations - the men answering would fall outside the scope of the questionnaire, 
  we have to open up the possibility of men simply writing personally and directly 
  without answering any questions, and this possibility should be at the top of 
  the page and the bottom.</I></P>
<P></P>
<P><B>6</B><I><B>.</B></I><B> Frenulum status</B></P>
<P>a - My frenulum is intact<BR>
  b - My frenulum ripped, but healed well with no change.<BR>
  c - My frenulum ripped once or several times due to sexual activity and thus 
  got <B>shorter</B>, although it healed allright.<BR>
  d - My frenulum ripped once or several times due to sexual activity and thus 
  got <B>longer</B>, since the cut healed in a different way i.e. not vertically 
  but horizontally i.e. stretched.<BR>
  e - My frenulum ripped once or several times due to sexual activity and <B>got 
  medical attention</B>, thus receiving stitches, but healed allright and with 
  no change.<BR>
  f - My frenulum ripped once or several times due to sexual activity and <B>got 
  medical attention</B>, thus receiving stitches and ending up being <B>shorter</B>, 
  although it healed alright.<BR>
  g - My frenulum ripped once or several times due to sexual activity and <B>got 
  medical attention</B>, thus receiving stitches and ending up being <B>longer</B>.<BR>
  h - I had a frenuloplasty : simple cut through thin, membranous upper part of 
  frenulum and no stitches Tiny flaps of skin !<BR>
  i - I had a frenuloplasty : simple cut through a thicker frenulum, horizontal 
  stretching and several stitches. No flaps of skin !<BR>
  j - I had a frenuloplasty : Z-plasty or Y-plasty<BR>
  k - I had a partial frenulotomy i.e. my frenulum was cut away at its thinner, 
  more membraneous part near the glans<BR>
  l - I had a frenulotomy where the frenulum was completely cut out, a lot of 
  stitches where needed to fix the wound</P>
<P><I>WOW - But even I dont understand the difference between frenuloplasty and 
  frenulotomy or Z and Y plasty - most people will not understand these differences 
  - I`d like an explanation - whatever the explanation is, questions like &quot;did 
  you have horizontal or vertical stitches?&quot; might be the best way to ask 
  - </I></P>
<P><I>OK so there is a lot you could say about frenulum treatment and lets get 
  it up in the right place on the <A HREF="../../frenulum_treatment.html">frenulum 
  treatment</A> file .... lets explain to men what the difference is between Y 
  and Z PLASTY (I`ve one historic picture of Z plasty (the first report) at the 
  beginning of the treatment section of the <A HREF="../../frenulum_studies.html">frenulum 
  studies</A> which could be included) - lets describe the difference between 
  frenulotomy and frenuloplasty - you understand it far better than me - why do 
  some men have 6 or 7 horizontal scars and others have one long vertical??? -</I><I> 
  </I></P>
<P><B>7.</B> If you had a <B>ripping</B> of the frenulum or a <B>surgical intervention</B> 
  of any kind on either penis, foreskin or frenulum state how many years have 
  passed since.</P>
<P><B>8.</B> Personally do have the <B>feeling</B> that there is something which 
  is not entirely correct with either your foreskin or your frenulum ?</P>
<P><B>9.</B> Are you able to <B>draw back your foreskin</B> past the glans without 
  any difficulties when your penis is in its erect state ? </P>
<P><B>10. Length of flaccid penis</B> = length of penis, when it is completely 
  flaccid and in its shortest size. During the measurement you should be standing 
  and holding your penis at a 90° angle to your body when you are measuring it. 
  Press ruler against pubic bone and measure from penis base to tip, though disregarding 
  overhanging foreskin.</P>
<P><B>11. Lenght of erect penis</B> = length of penis, when it is erect to its 
  maximum. During the measurement you should be standing and holding your penis 
  at a 90° angle to your body. Press a ruler against pubic bone and measure from 
  penis base to tip of glans.</P>
<P><I>I dont know, but I think the question can be included. Firstly I think men will enjoy answering the 
  question and secondly in the context of comparing measurements pre operation 
  and post operation this might provide some very interesting evidence -</I></P>
<P><I>particularly if you are going to ask the following questions then the length 
  seems necessary if only for completeness. The question is ... we need to know 
  flaccid measurements, or we need to know how frenulum in all its different variations 
  looks in the flaccid state - so do we need to know all the following questions 
  when flaccid, hummm what hidden intention do you have ... when starting something 
  like this then it must be done on intuition or perhaps you cant explain your 
  hidden intentions ... </I></P>
<P><B>12. Circumference of the penis</B> = circumference of the shaft of the penis, 
  when the penis is erect to its maximum. Simply measure the diameter of the shaft 
  where it is widest. </P>
<P><B>15. Circumference of the glans</B> = circumference of glans, when the penis 
  is erect to its maximum. Simply measure the diameter of the glans where it is 
  widest. Usually this is the case at the corona.</P>
<P><I>Put the circumference measurements in order - I`ll run through a few English 
  refinements later</I></P>
<P><B>14. Length of glans</B> = length of glans, when the penis is erect to its 
  maximum. Simply measure the length of the glans from corona to tip at the upper 
  side of the penis.</P>
<P><I>you need to take the <B>bold</B> or<B> thick</B> print out of the following 
  2 questions to make them intelligable</I></P>
<P><B>16. The zone at the glans which is widest</B> is ..... mm above the corona. 
  If it is the brim of the glans i. e. the corona itself, then enter 0 mm !</P>
<P><B>13. The zone where the shaft is widest</B>, is situated ...... mm <I>behind</I> 
  the corona of the glans.</P>
<P><B>17. Type of glans covering</B> : <I><B>When Erect</B></I></P>

<P>a - Glans is completely covered. Foreskin overhangs.<BR>
  b - Glans is completely covered, but foreskin doesn't overhang<BR>
  c - Only tip of Glans i. e. pee hole or slit is not covered.<BR>

  e - The glans is completely exposed</P>
<P><B>18. Lengh of the<I> riged band of the outer foreskin</I></B><I> question 
  needs completely rearranging</I></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><B>19. Length of the inner foreskin</B> =length of the reddish, corallike skin 
  that covers the shaft from the ridge of glans to the beginning of the<I> ridged 
  band of the outer foreskin. - change wording</I></P>
<P> <B>20. Circumference of the &quot;phimotic ring&quot;</B> = no inverted commas 
  for <B>phimotic ring</B> </P>
<P>If you are able to retract your foreskin during erection - draw the foreskin 
  of your erect penis back as much as you can. If you have a mild phimotic ring 
  you will see a constriction zone on your foreskin which goes almost all around, 
  forming a very slight hourglass appearance. Additionally the shorter your frenulum 
  the bigger the obliquity of that constricted and &quot;overstretched&quot; zone, 
  the phimotic ring. You may measure this tight ring in its obliquity or your 
  may release some of the tension by letting your foreskin slide a bit forward 
  so that the obliquity of the ring is reduced and measure then. You result should 
  be more or less the same.</P>
<P><I>have changed bits of the question but result should be more or less the 
  same.- sounds rather vague - I find something very ingenious about your following 
  measuring method </I></P>
<P>If on the other hand your foreskin is wide you may measure the circumference 
  of its narrowest zone with a flexible strip of cardboard (ca. 2 cm wide and 
  20 cm long). Role the cardboard into a small tube so that it fits between glans 
  and foreskin and than let it expand in its circumference until you feel that 
  your foreskin is really stretched out. Mark the point where the ends of the 
  strip overlap, remove the cardboard strip and measure the marked length.</P>
<P><B>21. Frenulums upper point</B> = point where the frenulum attaches to the 
  glans or nearest to this. The best way to assert this point is to hold the glans 
  between thumb and forefinger of your left hand, turn it around so you can see 
  its underside and gently move the frenulum from one side to the other so that 
  it stretches slightly sideways and you actually can see where it exactly starts. 
  Although it <I>makes no difference if</I> you asses this point is indifferent 
  to asses this point whether your penis is flaccid or erect, the latter may facilitate 
  a correct assessment. </P>
<P><I>note: twisting the erect penis, could lead to injury - we need to phrase 
  any examination carefully.</I></P>

<P><B>22. Frenulums lower point </B>= point where the frenulum attaches itself 
  to the foreskin or to the shaft of the penis. In order to assess this first 
  pull your foreskin back down the shaft of the penis, preferably on its erect 
  state, so that the frenulum is a bit overstretched and tense and turns whitish. 
  <I>CUT Then carefully inspect the frenulums lower area. (lower in which direction) 
  CUT </I> Look for the point where the frenulum splits up like a root into three 
  or more branches, and thus goes over into the foreskin. If <I> CUT...CUT </I>you 
  are able to completely <I>withdraw retract</I> your foreskin on the shaft of 
  the penis you may not see any <I>branching out splicing</I> of the frenulum 
  at all. The frenulum just smoothly goes over into the raphe. None the less, 
  even in this case there is usually a definite point where the frenulum stops 
  having its whitish appearance and completely looses its prominency. In <I>a 
  lot</I> men the point where the frenulum ends is also the point where the thick 
  frenular vein runs across the shaft. - <I>Do you know &quot;a lot&quot;?? I

  the gap of stretched foreskin i.e. from the glans brim till where it starts 
  making fine pleas, or if no pleas are visible from glans until the constriction 
  zone at the outer foreskin. The pictures below may help you visualize what the

  back while in the flaccid state. Hold the completely stretched foreskin with 
  your left hand at base of penis, turning the penis around its axis by 90° so 
  that you can see your frenulum sideways. Measure angle between the imaginary 
  line of the penis shafts axis and a line that goes through the pee hole. The

<P><B>27. Thickness of the frenulum</B> = With your penis in a flaccid state and 
  turned around its axis by 90° so that you can see your frenulum sideways, draw 
  your foreskin back past the glans holding it with your left hand if necessary, 
  and than with the thumb and index of your right hand pull your frenulum at its 
  base away from shaft and so that it stretches a bit out vertically to the shaft. 
  If it is thin enough you may see a lot of small red capillaries shinning through 
  the translucent membranous frenulum. Measure thickness of frenulum with a ruler 
  in mm.</P>

<P>Additional remarks : ........</P>
<P><I>we need some other way of answering. It would be tricky to set up a questionnaire 
  formular but I feel you need single word answers which are unmistakeable as 
  much as possible rather than a,b,c,d,e so that we and the writer can read the 
  sense in his own answers - for example your own answers 8 to 12 must refer to 
  different questions they are in the wrong place!</I></P>

Much modern medical information on circumcision (from popular literature to reports in medical journals), recommends that the best care for a foreskin is to leave it alone. These reports are all based on &Oslash;ster's misinterpreted study. &Oslash;ster made his report following 7 years of education and monitoring. Such care and attention obviously results in less problems.</FONT></P>

                            <P>The medical profession needs some sort of guideline about what to 
                              check for. - to ask the boy to retract his own foreskin and then to 
                              check the frenulum is the essential test.  Checking the 
                              frenulum would reveal any other condition - (except a relative phimosis, 
                              however if no ring is visible when flaccid, then this will not lead to 
                              paraphimosis). 
                            <P>The most appropriate attitude would be to always ask the boy to 
                              retract his own foreskin, (for a variety of reasons which are discussed 
                              in <A HREF="prevention.html#start">prevention</A>). BUT, when the boy 
                              is asked, does he understand the question? If not, then the idea that 
                              an important part of his manhood lies hidden, is probably not apparent 
                              to the boy. </P>
                            <P>The doctor is truly in the position of leading an important 
                              part of the boy's initiation into manhood. It may be a good idea to tactfully inform the 
                              boy that the foreskin normally retracts, and first give the boy a little time to get used to 
                              this new idea.</P>

Much modern medical information on circumcision (from popular literature to reports in medical journals), recommends that the best care for a foreskin is to leave it alone. These reports are all based on &Oslash;ster's misinterpreted study. &Oslash;ster made his report following 7 years of education and monitoring. Such care and attention obviously results in less problems.</FONT></P></TD>

                              Every infant boy has erections. These erections start in the embryo 
                              and they continue throughout his childhood. One can imagine that without 
                              infant erections, if boys suddenly started having erections at puberty 
                              without any previous exercise, there would be a number of muscle strains 
                              not to mention the sudden explosion of a few blood vessels. Equally, 
                              if a boy arrives at puberty without any prior exercise of the foreskin, 
                              one may expect a degree of tightness and rigidity in the foreskin and 
                              some difficulty in retraction.</P>
                            <P><B>Stretching While Young</B><BR>
                              When the preputial skin has moulded round the glans, in the womb and 
                              throughout childhood, and has not been allowed any exercise apart from 
                              the variation between the flaccid and erect states, the foreskin not 
                              only develops a limited elasticity, but also any skin tissue which 
                              has a tendency to be stiff will slowly become more rigid. </P>
                            <P>It is generally understood that the younger the child is, the more 
                              flexible his skin is. It would therefore be most effective for a child 
                              to start stretching his own foreskin, at an early age..</P>

                              </B><I>(Whereas nappies are probably the primary physical hindrance)</I> . . . The primary anatomical hindrance to an infant boy naturally stretching 
                              his own preputial skin are the adhesions. These <B>adhesions restrict 
                                a child's exploration and self manipulation simply because they hurt 
                                as the foreskin is pulled off the glans.</B></P>
                            <P>Children who have no adhesions, experience no pain, have no physical 
                              hindrance and they naturally and happily pull on, explore, experiment 
                              with and stretch any tightness out of their foreskin. - Therefore <B>those 
                                who most need to start stretching, are the children who are also anatomically 
                                hindered in doing this. </B></P>

I believe that if a method of dissolving adhesions could be found and 
children were encouraged in their natural self manipulation of the 
foreskin, then the majority of foreskin conditions could be prevented.
                            <P>I hope at some time in the future a method of dissolving these adhesions 
                              will be available. (I believe this has never been researched). At present, 
                              checking, monitoring and thus encouragement are even more necessary.</P>
                            <P><B>Encouragement</B><BR>
                              If you let him the normal child will start to pull forward on his foreskin. 
                              This is the first step of a normal infant child's own self manipulation, 
                              This is a very healthy habit because it is the easiest obvious natural 
                              way for a child to slowly release his own adhesions. (And in the process, 
                              start stretching out the phimosis and extending the frenulum).<BR>
                            </P>
                            <P>The floppy, bottlenose dolphin shape of an infants penis, makes 
                              it an ideal bath time play friend. It is helpful to encourage the idea 
                              that such play is good and interesting.</P>
                            <P>Letting your child play with himself will not turn him into a sex 
                              maniac; this is far more likely to occur when such innocent play is 
                              inhibited.</P>
                            <P><B>Retraction</B><BR>
                              When a toddler relieves themselves in public, the careful parent will 
                              often help by gently pulling back the overhang of the foreskin (so 
                              that spraying etc., can be avoided), and aiming the penis away from 
                              the boy's trousers. By this I wish to establish that it is everyday 
                              procedure for the parent to help with gentle retraction.</P>
                            <P>A second way to encourage the release of the adhesions is when bathing, 
                              to gently retract the foreskin as far as it will go, to wash it. A 
                              child will easily learn that this part of his body is or could soon 
                              be accessible (and may hopefully in the process also learn to wash 
                              his own penis). </P>
                            <P>One should <B>never use force to push or pull back on a boy's foreskin</B> - this cannot be repeated often enough, there are an extraordinary 
                              amount of people who support the use of forceful stretching exercises 
                              - there are a number of anatomical complications which force may cause, 
                              but quite simply such a first step into manhood is a truly ridiculous 
                              initiation for our culture. The use of force and pain builds up negative 
                              psychological attitudes about what one is attempting to achieve, i.e. 
                              retracting the foreskin.</P>
                            <P>As one is trying to stimulate the child's own interest and awareness 
                              about retraction, it is always best to let a child retract his own 
                              foreskin and to encourage this. Once the tip of the glans is visible, 
                              playful questions like &quot;oooh what's that?&quot; appear to stimulate 
                              the infant intelligence better than any book.</P>
                            <P>I would suggest an appropriate modern initiation would be to discover 
                              his glans as the result of self experiment, and that a boy would experience 
                              a feeling of excitement and fun about such an interesting new discovery 
                              about his own male body.</P>
                            <P><B>Conclusion and Summary</B> <BR>
                              Gairdner's much quoted study tells us there is no reason for any 
                              great concern during the first year: &quot;the prepuce is non-retractable 
                              ... in half of normal males of 1 year.&quot; <A
HREF="library/xtras/refs.html#ref4">(4)</A>. However, seldom quoted 
                              is his observation that by the third year the adhesions should have 
                              released. </P>
                            <P>&quot;After about the 3 years of age steps should be taken to render 
                              the prepuce of all boys retractable and capable of being kept clean.&quot;</P>
                            <P>Once some form of these ideas are acknowledged and become practised, 
                              it appears that in many countries and cultures, at least one boy in 
                              ten would have a healthier and happier start to life.</P>
                            <P><B>Note</B><BR>
                              During puberty a certain amount of boys develop a secondary phimosis, 
                              and these develop slowly over the period of a few years. The frequency 
                              must be very small however the experience appears to be a very bad 
                              and embarrassing one ... Therefore the extremely prudent parent will 
                              take some step to ensure such difficulties are diagnosed early, this 
                              will be difficult because during puberty a boy requires a certain privacy. 
                              - It would seem appropriate to our culture's thinking to have some 
                              form of education on the subject. ...</P></TD>

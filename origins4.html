          male circumcision. Most of the literature shows no awareness 
          of phimosis - its frequency - or the sexual and erectile problems which can be cured by circumcision. If routine circumcision 
          had been introduced for this most obvious reason of eliminating difficult 
          foreskins; then the importance of an alternative modern method, suitable to our culture's attitudes in this day and age, would be clear. </FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              The principle reason for the anthropologists dismissal of phimosis is that 
                              it is thought to be a rarity; however the anthropologists who discussed 
                              this subject never referred to a statistical study. It appears that 
                              no study on the statistics involving anything more than guesswork was 
                              available previous to the 1940s.                            </P>
                            <P><A HREF="statistics.html#start">The statistics 
                              from a variety of reputable medical studies,</A> show that between 
                              2.4% and 14% of all adolescents have a recognisable phimosis on the flaccid 
                              penis. However, because by nature, these conditions do not stretch 
                              to the same extent as the surrounding foreskin, the effects become 
                              more pronounced during erection. The erectile frequency has never been measured. Also this figure does not include youths 
                              who have relative phimosis (invisible when flaccid) or boys who were 
                              operated for phimosis before puberty, also omitted are cases of phimosis which develop 
                              in middle and old age; nor does it include any appreciation of the 
                              short frenulum. No statistics are available for persistent short frenulum 
                              except among animals (higher mammals) where between 0.5% and 5.7% have 
                              this condition. 
                            <P>In addition almost every child <EM>appears</EM> to have phimosis, for scientific thinkers this leads to no confusion, however for ancient peoples, all these reasons add up to a significantly higher frequency of 
                              the &quot;apparent&quot; need to circumcise, than could be found in 
                              scientifically conducted surveys. 
                            <P>But these statistics are only valid because they refer to large 
                              sample groups, and therefore they must be rejected because the operation developed among hunting peoples who lived in small groups. Statistics 
                              are known to fluctuate notoriously when measured in small groups. 
                            <P>We may expect that the smaller the sample group the more the frequency 
                                    would fluctuate - for example a group the size of an extended family 
                                    would be unacceptable and unreliable for scientific purposes, simply 
                                    because measurements would sometimes reveal nothing and at other times 
                                  indicate a commonplace occurrence.                             
                            <P>In addition the various problems sometimes with urination during 
                                        infancy sometimes with masturbation at beginning of puberty sometimes 
                                        during first intercourse or with secondary phimosis developing unpredictably 
                                        in middle age and the almost inevitable old age phimosis - would enable 
                                        males of several generations to have simultaneous problems. 
                                  <P>This all adds up to an extremely high periodical incidence. With a basic background scientific figure of 10% we could expect in small groups a fluctuation of between 0% and 100%
                                  <P><B>SPONTANEOUS DECISIONS</B><BR>
                                    When viewed on an objective time scale, the modern man might correctly 
                              dismiss localised and specific high frequencies as unrelated and meaningless. 
                              Howver among ancient peoples one could imagine that such simultaneously 
                              occurring events would stimulate an emotional response, and that this 
                              in turn could result in a practical or decisive course of action.
                                  <P>It is often criticised when one supposes how natural peoples might 
                                    have thought and felt. Bryk called the pre-literate man, the prelogical 
                                    thinker, and described a part of his intellectual understanding 
                                    as follows: <FONT SIZE="2"><I><A HREF="anthropology/bryk/bryk_de5.html#wish">(original 
                                      German)</A></I></FONT>: &quot; ... due to his incredible suggestibility, 
                                    intention and its fulfillment occur synchronically. Indeed, all 
                                    primitive systems of therapeutics are based on this assumption.&quot;</P>
                                  <P>I believe it is not arrogant  to recognise that pre literate peoples 
                                    were more inclined to believe in the validity of their subjective experience 
                                    and feelings and be moved to action on these grounds; they certainly did not look for scientific proof. One may speculate about 
                                    the accuracy of emotional decisions, but the significant point is that gut 
                                    feelings motivate spontaneous action, without years of delay differentiating 
                                    between cause and effect to define and prove the exact nature of problems 
                                    involved before acting.                                  </P>

                                  conditions please see <A HREF="phimosis.html#start">Chapter One The Conditions</A>
                                  <P>We are considering a large variety of erectile difficulties influencing 
                                  various different areas of sexual health and activity. </P>
                                  <P> There are hundreds of different 
                                    individual degrees and combinations of frenular-phimotic variations 
                                    each causing specific physical effects when erect. All conditions cause 
                              some restriction on the free movement of the foreskin during erection. </P>
                                  <P>Some conditions are merely difficult or irritating others are intensely 
                                    painful, some cause problems by masturbation others first during intercourse, 
                                    and still others for several days after intercourse. A few common examples : Pain often occurs during puberty 
                                    with paraphimosis or a relative phimosis abrasively irritating the 
                                    corona of the glans and sometimes causing infections, during love making 
                                    a partial phimosis may bag up hindering penetration or the frenulum 
                                    may rip, alternatively the frenulum may pull and strain causing pain 
                                    for several days afterwards. 
                                  <P>Among young adults my findings are similar to <A HREF="library/medicus/beauge.html#start">Beauge</A> : "From the interviews it appears that the great majority of these 
                                    subjects are virgin, and that among those who have had sexual experience, 
                                    many have failed, with difficulty in penetration, pain and loss of 
                                    erection;"
                                  <P>Consider that even these days medical knowledge on these subjects is in its infancy. As recntly as 1996 a number of medical publications suggest &quot;the definition of this condition is obscure in most publications ... &quot; The different ring types &quot;fibrotic, lichenoid, normal,&quot; were first defined by Clemmensen in 1988, exact causes are still not known. Medical knowledge on frenulum breve is comparable; Grewel suggested a collective repression about frenulum breve. See <A HREF="medical_taboo.html#start">The Medical Taboo</A> </P>
                                      <P>How could anyone in pre-literate times have started understanding 
                                    and defining these problematic conditions in all their possible degrees 
                                    and combinations? </P>
                                  <P>The causes would have been irrelevant, the symptoms totally mystifying, 
                                    but contrary to the confusion of this complicated situation, the cure 
                                    would have been obvious, simple and practical -  to free up the foreskin and open out this enclosed area in some way.                                  </P>
                                  <P><B>THE ORIGINATOR<BR>
                                  </B>The anthropological and psychological theories on the origins of 
                              the practice discuss this as though it were the manifestation of impersonal 
                              unconcscious urges or cultural needs. All the theories given are devoid of any dynamic 
                              impulse which could have provoked the operation or its routine practice. 
                              The idea that  individuals introduced the measure has apparently never 
                              been discussed, nor, what reasons they may have had for this. A man 
                              who had personal experience of the erectile problems involved with 
                              foreskin conditions may well have had previously unconsidered reasons 
                              for introducing the practice. 
                                  <P>An adult male or female may have noticed and been concerned by the periodic high frequency. However 
                              I believe that it is only someone with personal experience of some 
                                    of the problems involved with retracting his own foreskin, and of treating it successfully with circumcision, who would 
                                    have the personal conviction (or maybe the emotional compulsion), necessary 
                                  to introduce such a dramatic measure in a routine form.</P>

&quot;It is a significant fact that circumcision . . . is invariably 
                                    performed before or at the age of puberty, or at latest before 
                                    marriage.&quot; <A HREF="library/xtras/refs.html#ref53">(53)</A>. This is often seen by anthropologists as an added point of confusion. However, the 
                                    conditions cause recognisable and functional problems through infections 
                                    or pain, before puberty, at puberty as a result of masturbation, 
                                    or often when making love for the first time. It appears that the 
                                    primitive intelligence realised the sense in establishing some 
                                    measure at an age <B><EM>previous</EM></B> to when these first problems occurred.
                            <P>Thus originally this preventative step would have been determined by the incidents 
                              the originator had witnessed (or imagined) among his extended family

                              the diversity of the ages at which circumcision is traditionally performed, 
                              is a perfect reflection of the many different reasons and ages a youth, 
                              boy or child, may need, or appear to need circumcision.                            </P>

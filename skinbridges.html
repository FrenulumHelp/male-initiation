        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                            <P>Infant adhesions are a natural adhesive bonding between the foreskin 
                              and the glans. This epithelium or layer is sometimes called epithelial 
                              adhesions. Should this bond be broken and the raw sticky skin surfaces 
                              be allowed to rest in contact again (in the presence of oxygen?), they 
                              fuse together with surprising efficiency, these fusions are called 
                              skin bridges.</P>
                            <P>Skin Bridges can occur in uncircumcised or circumcised boys. They 
                              can easily be half an inch long and a quarter inch wide, they can be 
                              either circular or flat.</P>
                            <P>In uncircumcised boys skin bridges usually occur singly. They can 
                              sometimes be hidden behind and combined with a phimosis usually they 
                              are situated near the front of the prepuce often directly underneath 
                              the meatus (the urinary opening of the glans). "It was attached to 
                              the inside of my foreskin - the inner foreskin, and stretched across 
                              to the tip of my glans - beside the meatus. It was about 6 mm in length, 
                              and about 4 mm wide. It was ordinary skin as far as I could see." </P>
                            <P>Skin bridges are usually associated with infant routine full circumcision. 
                              Among circumcised boys when the healing process is not supervised, 
                              skin bridges may form in rows between the circumcision scar and the 
                              glans.</P>
                            <P>I am grateful to <A HREF="library/passages/greg.html#start">Gregory 
                              Berrnath</A> for the following description.<BR>
  &quot;After I was circumcised as an infant, the wound was not taken 
                              care of with sufficient diligence, and it healed incorrectly. Portions 
                              of the raw edge of the remaining foreskin bonded to the glans, a little 
                              bit above the lower edge of the glans. This left series of &quot;skin 
                              bridges&quot;,... . </P>
                            <P>&quot;These varied in width from about 1/16&quot; to 1/4&quot;, 
                              and were attached off and on over about 2/3 of the circumference. ... 
                              It was a long time before I even realized it was abnormal.&quot; Greg 
                              cut these skin bridges himself, afterwards he notes that the length 
                              of his erect penis had increased by 1/4 inch.</P>
                            <P><B><A NAME="treatment"></A>TREATMENT</B><BR>
                              Skin-bridges require the very simple treatment of cutting through 
                              the joining bridge. Professional treatment could easily be found 
                              through any surgeon or even any normal doctor.</P>

        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

EPITHELIAL ADHESIONS</B><BR>
If the adhesive bond (or epithelium) is still intact between the glans 
                  and foreskin it is always noticeable at the beginning of puberty. For 
                  most boys the layer is only lightly stuck, and peeling the foreskin 
                  off the glans is interesting rather than painful. Sometimes however, 
                  the foreskin is so firmly bonded that it does not release, and then, 
                  when the boy attempts to move his foreskin this causes extreme pain. 
                            <P><A HREF="anthropology/bettelheim.html#start">Bettelheim records 
                              a boy under his care</A> whose &quot;painful adhesions interfered 
                              with full functioning of the penis.&quot;. One man reported gently 
                              stroking his erection, which while it may sound erotic, was limiting 
                              and frustrating enough for him to get circumcised as soon as he 
                              was 18.</P>

                              Here we should mention the very confusing and contradictory cases of 
                              contented phimotic infibulation: where the foreskin is held forward 
                              causing no pain and even allowing penetration. Though one may imagine 
                              that these men are missing out on something, they are aware of their 
                              condition and wish to remain as they are. 
                            <P>On the other hand there are many others who on discovering that 
                  they have an infibulating phimosis, get operated and say they wish 
                  they`d have had it done ages ago. One case of extreme phimosis told 
                  me that he had never masturbated or had any interest in sex previous 
                  to his operation at the age of 22 yrs. <A HREF="library/medicus/beauge.html#start">Beauge 
                    M.D.</A> reported &quot;Some boys never masturbate! We may doubt their 
                  assertions, but the tightness of their phimosis suggests their statements 
                  are correct.&quot; There are further examples of extreme phimosis in 
                  the following passages.

                              During puberty the experience of pain, difficulty or the proximity 
                              of pain is a common one. In most cases it can take several years, sometimes 
                              until adulthood, before a youth feels confident or aware enough to 
                              be able to confront this embarrassing obstacle. 
                            <P>When it is left to the boy alone to discover the problem by the 
                              conscious pain and difficulty of his first active erections, it means 
                              that a considerable percentage of boys are going to have a fully distorted 
                              first impression of sex and manhood. An absurdly mismanaged and senseless 
                              puberty ritual.</P>

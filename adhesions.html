          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention or specific illness related treatment. </FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                                    <TD><P>Among infants the foreskin normally sticks to the glans. This 
                                      epithelium or adhesive layer is natural, normal. It usually degenerates 
                                      freeing the foreskin in early infancy. Sometimes it does not release 
                                      in which case it is almost always recognised at the beginning 
                                      of puberty when during erection the adhesive layer between foreskin 
                                      and glans makes movement of the foreskin intensely painful. </P>
                                        <P>Care must be taken with these epithelial adhesions. Not only 
                                          can an attempt to release them cause intense pain but if they 
                                          are broken and if the sticky skin surfaces are allowed to rest 
                                          in contact with each other again, they can fuse together causing 
                                          skin bridges.         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              <P>                                
                              <P>(<I>Epithelium</I>: tissue forming the outer layer of skin, lining 
    alimentary canal and other hollow areas).
                              <P>The adhesive layer between the inner foreskin and the glans is 
                                  natural and normal in babies. This epithelium or layer will usually 
                                  release of its own accord, sometimes this happens before birth, 
                                  often within the first six months, and usually by the age of three 
                                  years old <A HREF="library/xtras/refs.html#ref4">(4)</A>. The layer 
                                  releases last around the coronal ridge and in the area of the frenulum. </P>
                                <P>There are different degrees of adherence. Boys often release 
                                  the foreskin themselves during childhood or at the beginning of 
                                  puberty, the experience can be compared to the sensation of peeling 
                                  elastoplast from sensitive skin and can be a relatively interesting 
                                  exploration leading to the welcome discovery of the glans. Doctors 
                                  also perform this separation occasionally without anaesthetic which 
                                  is reported as an extremely painful experience. 
                                <P>After separation, sometimes a white film can form on the glans 
                                  which has the tendency to re-stick and needs re-releasing and regular 
                                  washing. 
                                <P>Occasionally the pain which a boy experiences when attempting 
                                  to release these infant adhesions can be so intense that it completely 
                                  hinders attempts with retraction and sometimes a full adherence 
                                  will continue through puberty and even until adulthood. 
                                <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">One man described the pain 
                                  during erection as intense or immanent. He requested circumcision 
                                  at 13 yrs. old and was advised to "wait and see what happens" by 
                                  his doctors. He limited his enjoyment and exploration to manipulating 
                                  the phallus by gently stroking or applying pressure to the area 
                                  round the glans, He was eventually circumcised after a renewed 
                                  request as soon as he was legally eligable at 18. </FONT>
                                <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">In "Symbolic Wounds" <A HREF="anthropology/bettelheim.html#start">Bettelheim 
                                  reports a case</A> where during masturbation "painful adhesions 
                                  interfered with full functioning of the penis" <A HREF="library/xtras/refs.html#ref6">(6)</A>. 
                                  Bettelheim failed to recognise the degree of pain this causes, 
                                  even though the boy "wanted the operation very badly" obviously 
                                  a period of time elapsed before "Eventually we had to arrange for 
                                  his circumcision".</FONT>
                                <P>Infant adhesions should be released at an early age. The inhibitive 
                                  influence of pain throughout childhood erections cannot be expected 
                                  to have a positive effect on the behavioural habits and psychological 
                                  attitudes of a child. 
                                <P>In addition from a practical perspective, a childs natural exploration 
                                  and manipulation is severly hindered by the immanence of pain. 
                                  He cannot explore and indulge in the natural early exercise which 
                                  he would otherwise enjoy. We could normally expect this early exercise 
                                  to encourage the development of a healthy and supple foreskin which 
                                  may subsequently be more resistant to stiffening processes. </P>
                                <P>Possibly because the sensation of pain is so obvious for the 
                                  young men with this condition, they actively desire to be circumcised, 
                                  therefore infant adhesions are usually treated during adolescence 
                                  or at latest as a young adult.

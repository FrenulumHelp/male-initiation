        <P><FONT SIZE="2">The concept that an anatomical deficiency in the erection can influence the 
  sexuality appears to contradict every advance in understanding which our culture 
  has made over the last century. - Psychological research has concentrated on parental 
          and environmental phenomenon, and the urological disciplines do not 
          include sexual behaviour. Scientific research has overlooked this area 
          of human sexuality. </FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                            <BLOCKQUOTE>
                              <P>Human nature is unendingly flexible and vulnerable, we learn a general 
                                basis for socially acceptable behaviour usually indirectly from parents 
                                and environment, wishing to please and be accepted. This is often described 
                                as the socialisation of raw human nature. 
                              <P>Pain and pleasure mould specific responses. The traumatic or repeated 
                                experience of pain lays the basis for habitual and often compulsive 
                                behavioural responses and this takes extreme forms when the development 
                                is of a subconscious or semi-conscious nature since infancy. 
                              <P>It is also worth considering that the repeated experience of pain 
                            is the basis for aversion therapy.                            </BLOCKQUOTE>
                            <P>It would be helpful to understand unrecognised foreskin conditions 
                              as inhibitions <A HREF="library/surround/inhibition.html#start">(see 
                                dictionary definitions).</A> This anatomical inhibition has emotional 
                              consequences which are comparable with the classical inhibitions, they 
                              make a persons behaviour less flexible less spontaneous, he becomes 
                              less able to respond to life`s various situations, he adopts safe roles 
                              even non-confrontative wishes and intentions.
<P>The consequences of unacknowledged or avoided pain are far more 
                              chaotic than any fully conscious repeated pain stimulus. In the same 
                              way as any other disturbance which is not acknowledged, it is repressed, 
                              sublimated and displaces.                 
                            <P> The lack of confrontation inevitably generates 
                              irrational consequences and as with any other irrational influence 
                              or subconscious disturbance, after years of insinuation, this has very 
                              real and fundamental effects on a man`s outlook on life, his behaviour, 
                              emotions, psychology, and fantasy.                 
                            <P>An interesting comparison can be drawn with the incest victim`s 
                              lack of trust, spontaneity and limited sexual behaviour roles, often 
                              with some history of believing or trying to believe that such child 
                              parent relationships were normal (to live with and adapt to a chaotic 
                              environment). 
                            <P>A person who represses their homosexuality is another significant 
                              comparison, the effects commencing during puberty, becoming progressively 
                              disturbing and disorientating as self deceptions and habits reinforce 
                              each other. As years go by the consequences become increasingly chaotic 
                              and bizarre.                  
                            <P>Genital pain and difficulties and the fear or avoidance of these 
                    difficulties are very elementary influences, and over a period of years 
                    the effects can permeate the entire personality, supporting and stimulating 
                    compatible influences and fears, and undermining any healthy re-learning 
                    process.

                              <P>A deviation from normal, uninhibited sexual behaviour starts developing 
                                during masturbation. It is generally understood that the most normal 
                                method of masturbating is by moving the foreskin backwards and forwards. 
                                With these conditions a freely movable foreskin at the same time as 
                                a full erection is impossible. <A HREF="library/medicus/beauge.html#start">Beauge</A> discussed this in detail.                     
                              <P><B>A boy with these conditions develops a sexual 
                                behavioural relationship with himself which is determined by his anatomical 
                                limitation.</B> His behavioural patterns are reinforced frequently, in 
                                fact every time he masturbates during this important development phase 
                                throughout puberty. After a period of time he will develop patterns 
                                of sexual enjoyment which however creative, seen anatomically they 
                            are bound to be deviations from normal. <B>His behaviour is truly conditioned. </B>                            </BLOCKQUOTE>
                            <P><B>The relationship with his own body (and imparticularly his "private 
                              parts") influences the whole shape of a boys developing sexual imagination 
                              and identity.</B>

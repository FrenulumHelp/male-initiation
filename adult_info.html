        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br>
          <br>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                                with suggestions for the sexual advice books and therapists 
                                <P>Every adolescent and adult male should realise that when erect, 
                                  the foreskin is normally movable, with the possibility of pulling 
                                  it back inside out so that it sheathes the shaft. In doing this, 
                                  the frenulum should not be so tight that it pulls the glans downward, 
                                  or the foreskin forward again. 
                                <P>A good piece of information is that retraction takes place automatically 
                                  when erect among most normal uncircumcised men. 
                                <P>Another way of describing the situation: most uncircumcised men 
                                  find it enjoyable to move the foreskin backwards and forwards over 
                                  the glans. 
                                <P>A good description is phimosis &quot;inhibits 
                                the movement of the foreskin, especially on the erect penis.&quot; 
                                
                                <P>You are not stupid if you didnt realise this! If you did not realise 
                                  then your foreskin is certainly either painful or difficult in some 
                                  way, and it is normal for people to avoid pain and difficulty, this 
                                  happens in all walks of life. 
                                <P>Such information is essential among sufferers who have adapted 
                                  to their condition accepting it is normal. It is exactly because 
                                  of their anatomical inhibition that some of these men have never 
                                  developed a normal awareness of the phallus. Such men have never 
                                  looked at their own glans when erect let alone compared themselves 
                                  with other men. Thus it is also important to remember that such 
                                  men may find pictures of the phallus to be estranging or even objectionable 
                                  - simply because these pictures are so different to their own experience 
                                  and year long confirmation. Written information in sexual advice 
                                  books is necessary, in year 1997 neither this nor pictures were 
                                  available. 
                                <P>Often men with such conditions believe that pictures of the retracted 
                                  foreskin simply belong to circumcised men. A row of pictures showing 
                                  the gradual retraction of the foreskin would be helpful. 
                                <P>Therapists should be aware that with any sexual disorientation, 
                                  even if environmental problems appear to predominate, a short conversation 
                                  to confirm the patient is aware of foreskin retraction will eliminate 
                                  the possibility of this extra hidden complication. - Please see <A HREF="library/surround/common_sense.html#start">The Sexual Therapists

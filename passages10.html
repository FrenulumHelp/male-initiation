        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                              40 and married. ... My foreskin has been tight for as long as I can 
                              remember. I do remember once (about13 years old I think ) being taken 
                              to my doctor about it, and the outcome I think, or his opinion, was 
                              - "it will stretch". 
                            
                          <P>&quot;Sex has usually been stressful (rather than uncomfortable) 
                              to the point where I dont have it now." ... (<I>he describes</I>) "a 
                              thin strip of skin. It looks short - perhaps from the glands, about 
                              2-3mm before it gets thicker and joins to the foreskin. ... This area 
                              has ripped before during intercourse a couple of times. Small amount 
                              of blood, a lot of worry, ... My penis softens ( perhaps cos I'm thinking 
                              "this is gonna rip!)" 
                            <P><I><A HREF="library/passages/frenular-retribution.html#start">e.g.33</A></I> A man of 22 wrote &quot;Up to now I had never really thought of it 
                                        in terms of something that I could cure, but rather just live with. &quot;My frenulum was always very tight but I considered it normal 
                    having nothing to compare with. Masturbating was a mix of thrill and 
                    slight pain, which I started to accentuate over the years : pleasure 
                    and pain, satisfaction and remorse/cupability - sometimes feeling that 
                    my penis was going to "break", to bleed as a punition for masturbating. 
                    I think I got used to it and it always remained easy to control pain 
                    as I was masturbating. 
                            <P>&quot;my frenulum ripped during penetration...I was very ashamed 
                                        and try to hide it...she noticed of course, the bed being full of blood 
                                        .... 4 days ago, my frenulum ripped again, very slightly in fact because 
                                        there is not much to rip, but still it has ripped. ... I feel I was 
                                        never informed about the condition and never properly examined by doctors 
                                        I have met during my schooling. The years going by, I got used to the 
                                        condition but I am now sure that this discomfort prevents me from an 
                                        optimal sex life. ... My frenulum, even after 4 rippings (and truly 
                                        speaking four mini traumas), is today still too tight.</P>
                                      <P>&quot;Thanks again for your work which has helped me to reconsider 
                                        my condition and at last to be convinced that if I am obsessed by my 
                                        genitals, I have a reason for. this."</P>

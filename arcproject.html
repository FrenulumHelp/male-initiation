        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                                  <p>Welcome Friend, <br>
                                    <br>
this is my latest   attempt to get some sort of gathering of people - who feel an importance   in the subject - experience of the social taboos and the ignorance ...   how the treatment situation is crazy ... the chaos and futility of the   whole experience - and that future kids dont need to go through that   ridiculous waste of time and energy and love ... <br>
<br>
There appears to be no   group supporting education about Phimosis ... no official voice   - lobby - movement ... and no support for individuals (e.g. myself when   i was doing http://www.male-initiation.net) ... no-one to even check   draft letters or html pages --- give helpful ideas or anything to each   other.<br>
<br>
I want a place where people can coordinate, exchange ideas   and info. A meeting place - a group to motivate, support each other    ... I think we need to produce something like a ten point manifesto and a   little information booklet, but i am open to ideas - how can we help   educate everyone?<br>
<br>
and, Where is the best place for a group to   develop? i know nothing of modern social networks - This forum is the   start ... please leave your ideas ...What sort of meeting place - forum -   message board would be better? .. <br>
<br>
i would ask you for some sort of introduction ... maybe your personal history - your personal point of view and ideas -<br>
<br>
we   all come from very different walks of life ... we all have very   different interests and angles of importance on this subject ... i do   not expect any great connections at first - but maybe in a years time,   if we could get 20 people here ... 20 would be enough to blur the   differences between us and find some common ground.<br>
<br>
i feel the   only thing which does not belong here are emergency needs .. because we   would get swamped and under time pressure and stress - naturally it was   our needs which motivated our interest in this subject ... so needs must   be included ... but please use your discretion <br>
<br>
at present   people are here only by my or your invitation, it is not advertised   online ... this may change IF the people here want it ... i just hope   slowly, we can start gathering here ...</p>

          male circumcision. Most of the literature shows no awareness 
          of phimosis - its frequency - or the sexual and erectile problems which can be cured by circumcision. If routine circumcision 
          had been introduced for this most obvious reason of eliminating difficult 
          foreskins; then the importance of an alternative modern method, suitable to our culture's attitudes in this day and age, would be clear. </FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                            <P>Ploss emphasised over and over again with biblical references and 
                              undeniable logic that fertility was the reason for the practice among 
                              the Jews (and an awareness of fertility would be expected among such 
                              an advanced literate people). And 
                              here, with respect to the Jews, he would agree that they had an &quot; 
                              erroneous over estimation of its effect on fertility.&quot;<A HREF="library/xtras/refs.html#ref39"></A>
                            <P>However with respect to natural peoples 
                              he suggests a mixture of general ideas including fertility. 
                             He emphasises the wish to correct nature and create a normal 
                              adult appearance,
                            he mentions "causing difficulties during sexual activity", "an obstacle to 
                              coitus" and "the enjoyment of sex"
                            <P>It is difficult to define when Ploss stops talking about the Jews and goes on to natural peoples

                            <P>Ploss discusses and refutes the hygienic and purification theories among the Jews. &quot;they held the idea that during coitus the circumcised condition made 
                              fertilisation more successful, then it is written in the Bible: &quot;through 
                              circumcision God gave him the prospect of plentiful descendants.&quot;                            
                            .... There 
                              must be another psychological motive which moved them to adopt the 
                              operation."
                            <P>Paragraph 3<BR>
                              The purpose and intention of this operation lies, in my opinion, in 
                              the endeavour to correct nature. To help her with her supposed &quot;mistakes&quot; 
                              and to bring about a state on the sexual organ which one considers 
                              to be normal in adults. Such a state clearly never occurs of its own 
                              accord when left to nature among small children, and still does not 
                              develop spontaneously very often during puberty. On the other hand, 
                              it is not at all uncommon for such states to continue until adulthood 
                              causing difficulties during sexual activity. They wanted to eliminate 
                              phimosis, because they considered a man with such a defect was less 
                              able to have children.</P>
                            <P>In order to understand this it must be pointed out which process 
                              of change usually, if not always, occurs in the penis up until the 
                              time when procreation is possible. Among new born children, the foreskin 
                              covering the glans is always so formed that it is only with difficulty 
                              or force that it can be retracted over the glans. After a period of 
                              time in relationship to the development of the entire member, (the 
                              penis), the foreskin becomes a lot more elastic around its opening, 
                              so that later, in fact when the penis is in the erect state, in the 
                              majority of cases the foreskin folds back automatically.</P>
                            <P>It is thus quite normal for a new born child to possess a phimosis 
                              i.e. an elongation of the foreskin combined with a narrowness of the 
                              opening, such that the retraction of this behind the corona of the 
                              glans (which is profitable for a man in order to ejaculate when performing 
                              coitus); is not possible.</P>
                            <P>If everywhere and without any question (even among the insufficiently 
                              and inadequately observant natural peoples); the fact had been noticed 
                              that not uncommonly youths, as they develop to adulthood, may begin 
                              to carry the glans naked (because the prepuce retracts automatically 
                              and remains behind the corona); and in addition among men, the glans 
                              is still only abnormally covered by the foreskin during an erection; 
                              therefore the foreskin covering the glans appears to be an abnormal 
                              state of affairs, which one must quite routinely take counter measures 
                              against and correct in good time.</P>
                            <P>Paragraph 4<BR>
                              With this, I conclude that the original predisposition towards circumcision 
                              was the operational preparation for the sexual function of the man. 
                              One considers the child's foreskin, which has to some extent remained 
                              covering the glans, since earliest childhood regardless of everything, 
                              the persisting narrow condition of the phimosis; as being more or less 
                              an obstacle to coitus, which one must correct with a surgical operation.</P>
                            <P>It is for this reason, that most primitive peoples incise or ablate 
                              the foreskin, once the age of puberty, (when the maturity for the enjoyment 
                              of sex) has been reached: with this one decisive act they wanted to 
                              make the boy completely mature and normal in the sexual sense.</P>
                            <P>It is thus, an act which is conducted, whereby one takes the young 
                              person in as an equal among the group of mature, marryable men; and 
                              at the same time one combines this act with certain ceremonies, symbolic 
                              of this initiation; by which, with respect to the pain (that this forthcoming 
                              operation causes to the very sensitive male sexual organ), one wishes 
                              to develop a form of test on the masculine fortitude.</P>
                            <P>This singular operation which prepares for sexual adulthood, is 
                              practised by the Jews and Muslims among others, at quite an early age; 
                              here one believes it is necessary to fight against this natural state 
                              of incompleteness as soon as the child is born.</P>
                            <P>They want even the child to be assured the possibility of numerous 
                              offspring and not leave it to chance, if the phimosis which had been 
                              noticed on him, (which could perhaps hinder procreation); will resolve 
                              naturally by itself or if it will remain in the future. Thus it becomes 
                              regarded as a work which is pleasing to God: then it was held in itself 
                              by the Jews for highly worthwhile to have numerous offspring.&quot;</P>
                            <P>and then Ploss continues discussing the Jews with the emphasis on fertility -

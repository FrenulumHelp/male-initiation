        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. My concern is the early prevention of phimosis. The late correction of adult phimosis was never my interest. My belief is that once the medical profession realise the need, they will develop hundreds of new methods of treatment which I cant even imagine ... Therefore treatment  is  purely an appendix on this site, however, because I have no specific bias, my research allowed a rare objective survey of the many posibilities. </FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site offers  detailed information 
          on  individual problem related treatment, often advising simple, cheap, minimal and specific surgery and time honoured solutions taken from traditional methods including partial circumcision, dorsal slit and frenular incision and tying.

                                      <TD><P>Circumcision is an inaccurate operation for this condition. Western 
                                        medicine often offers the &quot;frenuloplasty&quot;. From a surgical point 
                                        of view this is a very small operation. It takes around twenty minutes 
                                        surgery and about an hour with the preparation. It is performed as 
                                        an outpatient. Normally there is a ten days to two weeks recovery time.</P></TD>

                                  Most men being operated for this condition, do not realise how extremely 
                                  sensitive and erotic the area round the frenulum can be. Previously 
                                  the frenulum has held the foreskin forward; experimentation has been 
                                  hindered and any stimulation in the area may have simply been painful. 
                                  The area around the frenulum is the most sensitive area on the phallus. 
                                  If the area is sensitive to pain at present, this will turn to pleasure 
                                  after being operated. Once you get it treated then the area around the frenulum under the glans will be a new source of pleasure. On normal men, the frenulum itself appears to be usually not very sensitive, however the area around the frenulum is often claimed to be the most sensitive on the penis.</P>
                                <P>Due to the curious nature of this condition men often feel they 
                                  suffer from what feels like a redundant or extra long, foreskin and request circumcision. 
                                <P><B>FRENULOPLASTY</B>
                                <P> Though a circumcision will leave the frenulum breve 
                                  little or nothing to pull on it is an inaccurate treatment for this 
                                  condition. Western medicine offers the &quot;frenuloplasty&quot;. From a surgical point of view, this is an insignificant 
                                  operation. It takes around twenty minutes surgery and about an hour 
                                  with the preparation. It is performed as an outpatient.</P>
                                <P>For some reason practicing surgeons and urologists often describe 
                                  the operation as an elongation of the frenulum, this is misleading, 
                                  it leaves the impression that you will receive a longer frenulum. Somehow, 
                                  by elongating they mean spreading it out, and I presume when you spread 
                                  a frenulum which is too short it disappears - The frenuloplasty does 
                                  NOT elongate the frenulum, it sews the frenulum into the shaft skin.</P>
                                <P>The frenuloplasty is performed by cutting a small series of either 
                                  z or y shaped cuts, which when stitched together will form a single 
                                  line, or a row of 5 or 6 small horizontal lines, (both are barely visible). 
                                  It takes about 2 weeks for the stitching to heal and 4 weeks before 
                                  the area becomes fully functional again. This is called a z-plasty 
                                  or y-plasty. (Any Urologist reading this is more than welcome to provide 
                                  a better description - for example: Does the z plasty lead to horizontal 
                                  scars and the y plasty to vertical?).</P>
                                <P>The operation which leaves one scar as a single line would be visually 
                                  superior to the 5 or 6 horizontal lines, though possibly one vertical 
                                  scar might present problems with stretching in old age.</P>
                                <P>For those who wish this easily available option, please find a 
                                  surgeon who is practiced in performing the frenuloplasty.</P>
                                <P>I have heard of around a thousand frenuloplasties without any problems<BR>
                                Warnings: One man complained of a hard scar after a laser frenuloplasty. One man was traumatised after frenuloplasty when a relative phimotic ring led to paraphimosis. If you have a mild phimotic ring which could lead to paraphimosis once the frenulum breve is removed, - the simplest precaution to take is please read the page on <A HREF="paraphimosis.html#start">paraphimosis</A>  - or stretch the ring enough before being operated - or tell the operating surgeon about this. </P>

                                  If you consult a surgeon or urologist with full confidence that an 
                                  incision is what you wish for, then I feel sure he could be persuaded 
                                  to perform this operation.</P>
                                <P><B>Various Ideas on Incisions</B><BR>
                                  The frenuloplasty is a surgically proficient operation which takes 
                                  into consideration the requirement of being neat. A simple incision 
                                  may leave a little dangling bit of skin, which would be untidy. </P>
                                <P>An interesting fact is that some anatomically normal men pull on 
                                  their frenulum as a form of masturbation, (this was reported by Bryk, 
                                  by Kinsey, and men who I interviewed). The reason I mention this is 
                                  I have heard of one Philippine man, who had been cut ritually, and 
                                  enjoyed pulling on the resultant flap of skin.</P>
                                <P><B>From an Incision there are three possibilities</B><BR>
                                  One or two tiny flaps of skin which you may or may not like,<BR>
                                  Often small flaps of skin  will recede into the shaft skin<BR>
                                  A second operation at a later date, to remove the flaps </P>
                                <P><B>DISCUSSION OF APPROPRIATE TREATMENT</B><BR>
                                  If the frenulum was checked before puberty, and if it is too short, 
                                  a simple incision may be all that is necessary. This will avoid any 
                                  stitch marks or any stretching problems with the scar. If an incision 
                                  is made in the frenulum breve at an early age, there is every reason 
                                  to believe (especially with a thin frenulum), that the remaining tiny 
                                  hanging flaps of skin, will simply recede into the shaft skin and the 
                                  glans. </P>
                                <P>Theoretically, this incredibly simple incision should be made in 
                                  exactly the same place where the frenulum would otherwise rip.</P>

                                <P><B><FONT SIZE="2">Stretching the Frenulum</FONT></B> is sometimes advised - It must considered as an experiment, usually requiring several months of 5 times daily stretching.  I feel this is more problematic than almost any other method - requiring a dedication which verges on obsession - however some men may wish to use this method. </P>
                                <P>Testing this would only be intelligent for someone 
                                with a mild degree of brevity where the frenulum was not connected near the meatus, and a frenulum which was not hemmed or topped with a string. </P>

                                  to enable a natural stretch ...(or more probably a controlled rip?) -  see the reports on <A HREF="steroids.html#start"> betamethasone</A></P>

                                <P>The majority of reports I have heard are that 
                                  stretching the frenulum rips it. Often a sudden stretch causes ripping. 
                                  A gentle regular stretching would be necessary - see <A HREF="stretching.html#start">stretching</A>.</P>

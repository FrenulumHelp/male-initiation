        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>

Among a percentage of men the band called &quot;the frenulum&quot; 
(which runs between the foreskin and underneath the opening of the 
urethra), is too short, so that on erection it tightens to its limit 
and can even rip. To add to the confusion this usually happens during 
the first sexual encounter causing a moment of great alarm for both 
participants at the resultant bleeding."

"There is nothing which leads to premature ejaculation more often than 
in those specific cases where the frenulum of the prepuce is too short. 
If it is still present following the first sexual encounters this anomaly 
frequently leads to premature ejaculation, however it is easy to cure 
under local anaesthetic without being admitted to hospital. Therefore 
it is the responsibility of every doctor and surgeon to detect this 
and to enquire after the sexuality of the man concerned, because most 
of the time, the patient himself will not dare confront the problem. 
In this matter the doctor has a truly prophylactic role in averting 
a catastrophic development."

"The rupture of the frenulum is an accident which, in certain circumstances, 
can be very serious, even leading to death."
<P> "Certain ruptures are "successful" in the sense that no corrective 
  measure is necessary. The others leave a persisting shortness of the 
  frenulum and at the same time a fragile scar which may rip in a repeated 
  manner. In these cases it is necessary to operate." 
<P> "In the majority of cases, it is difficulty during copulation which 
  brings the patients (to me). It is rare that the shortness of the frenulum 
  is alone the cause. Generally speaking, that which is the cause is 
  an insufficient diameter of the preputial opening, preventing or hindering 
  retraction, and this is often associated with a shortness of the frenulum."</P>
<P>"In effect, the shortness of the frenulum plays an obvious role 
  in the inability to retract, by imposing a too great obliqueness at 
  the ring of the preputial opening. In certain cases "relative" phimosis 
  is due to a shortness of the frenulum."</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2"><I><FONT SIZE="3">Qu&eacute;nu's use of the word 
  "relative" in the above passage may be confusing. At times frenulum 
  breve may occur simultaneously with a relative phimosis (phimotic ring) 
  and this complicates the anatomical and sexual effects as any combination 
  of such conditions does. </FONT><FONT
SIZE="3">Qu&eacute;nu</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> points out that the short 
    frenulum leads to an oblique effect which may be confused with a phimosis.</FONT></I></FONT></P>
<P>"Among older children, I have noticed that a short frenulum was 
  often the origin of an extensive symphysis around the neck (or collum), 
  of the glans penis and because of this, I have assumed that the shortness 
  of the frenulum plays a role in the emergence and perpetuation of the 
  balanoposthitis which creates and sustains the phimosis."</P>

"My attention was drawn to this anatomical configuration because in 
the course of the years I have been consulted by men who mostly after 
their first coition, showed an excoriation, a slight rhagade or even 
a slight laceration of the frenum behind the margin of the corona, 
or of the alae freni. ..." "Sometimes it was not during the first coition 
that this phenomenon occurred but during a later one, that was experienced 
as much more complete or more satisfactory than the foregoing. In a 
single case the rhagade had developed during masturbation. These excoriations 
may occur more than once."
<P>"The excoriation is seen in cases of forced coition in older men 
  with a rigid frenum; a young man with phimosis developed a slight laceration 
  in a forced trial to cohabitate." 
<P>"Does it occur in people who have never masturbated, the frenum 
  being more rigid or less resilient than in men who practised masturbation? 
  When it occurs in masturbation the excoriation seems to be localised 
  especially in the alae freni.&quot;</P>
<P>"Is the fact that the alae are more manifest in younger men than 
  in older due to the constant stretching or elongation of these formations 
  in the course of adult life? Elasticity of the frenum seems to prevent 
  the laceration." </P>

<P>"The normal frenulum is a mucous membrane on the ventral surface 
  of the glans penis, through which runs the frenular artery. A short 
  frenulum may apparently be congenital, when it is of normal thickness, 
  or secondary to recurrent infection or trauma, when it can be felt 
  in the flaccid state as a thickened band. When the penis is erect the 
  short frenulum restricts the prepuce and causes downward curvation 
  of the glans. During intercourse this means that there is an element 
  of chordee and the abnormal position of the glans penis causes pain. 
  Tension in the short frenulum itself is also painful and the band may 
  be torn and then heal by fibrosis, thus aggravating the situation.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Short frenulum should be sought as a cause for dyspareunia 
  in patients who do not have phimosis or questionable hygiene and who 
  may erroneously be labelled as having psychosexual problems."</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3"><I>Chitale and Whelan have a rather questionable 
  understanding of frenulum breve, suggesting it is the "ventral chordee, 
  which produces pain ..." and even that "the abnormal position of the 
  glans penis causes pain."</I></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3"><I> These conclusions are incorrect. Correct is that 
  the &quot;tethering&quot; effect of frenulum breve pulls the foreskin 
  forward. Pain, bruising, tension and soreness are caused by the foreskin 
  being pulled backwards straining the very sensitive frenulum. </I></FONT>
<P><FONT SIZE="3"><I>This pain occurs principally through nerves in 
  the frenulum itself; rather than the underside of the glans which is 
  also usually very sensitive. I would like to establish from other men's

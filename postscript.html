        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>

                                    <p ALIGN="left">I still feel  the best thing to do would be to find a <A HREF="dissolve.html#start">dissolving solution for adhesions</A>, ... but thats a vision of the future. </p>
                                    <p ALIGN="left"><strong><font size="3">MONITORING BOYS </font></strong>: <strong>My previous idea of monitoring 
                                      boys before puberty is, i now realise,  impractical.</strong></p>
                                    <p ALIGN="left">In my youth 1950s till year 2000, monitoring and early prevention was the modern approach and method for many medical  problems.  I always wanted normal medical awareness regarding prevention and treatment of phimosis, the same as any other medical problem. </p>
                                    <p ALIGN="left"><strong>There have been massive changes recently on planet earth : </strong></p>
                                    <p ALIGN="left">I believe one of the most interesting is that individuals can now upload videos for the world to share. At the same time many countries  have recently needed to budget health care, and it seems inevitable : the present systems &quot;financial wizards&quot; will continue to create inflation and etc. ... and there will be more social cuts and less money for research and preventative medicine. </p>
                                    <p ALIGN="left">It seems obvious to use the practical possibilities and resources available, and this really   suggests the most appropriate modern method in the immediate future, will be boys checking themselves using internet videos.</p>
                                    <p ALIGN="left"><strong>Self education, largely through videos, is at this time, I believe, the most appropriate modern method of prevention. </strong></p>
                                    <p ALIGN="left"> <strong>Collecting  videos (and converting them to drawings for some countries) showing the problems of  the different forms of phimosis is the next obvious step in research  information and education &ndash; also for the medical profession, who have so long had no opportunity to study the 20 different forms of phimosis.</strong></p>
                                    <p ALIGN="left">I am not going to do this myself! I have done enough on this subject. The site now has a new subtitle <strong><font size="3">The History of Phimosis up until year 2,000.</font></strong></p>
                                    <p ALIGN="left">I would be interested in any sites collecting video and picture information - so please <a href="contact.html#start">contact</a> me. ...  <A HREF="solutions.html#start"><br>
                                    </A>_____________________</p>
                                    <p ALIGN="left">... it is strange to feel  my site is already out of date ... of mere historical interest ... ;-) - but i dont want to rewrite all of chapter four .. &Oslash;ster and Beauge and that whole research area was valid, but the practical conclusion (monitoring young boys) is since year 2,000,  outdated. </p>
                                    <p ALIGN="left"> ..    - so, to close - id like the strange pleasure of quoting myself from <a href="routine.html#start">routine.html</a></p>
                                    <p ALIGN="left"> &quot;Future generations will certainly develop a completely new approach 
                                  and attitude to medicine and health. They might even consider routinely 
                                  gene manipulated body parts as appropriate. This is not important 
                                  to me, what is important and ridiculous to me, is it looks like we may have gene 
                                  manipulated hands noses and hair, <strong>but there will still be a debate 
                                  going on pro and anti routine circumcision.</strong>&quot; </p>
                                    <p ALIGN="left">Again : <strong>we need individual problem related treament</strong>. </p>

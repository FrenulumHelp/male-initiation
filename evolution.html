                                <P><B>THE PECKING ORDER THEORY</B><BR>
                                  At first, I believed in the goodness of mother nature, and thought 
                                  she would never inflict such an irrelevant problem on man; I believed 
                                  phimosis must be due to cultural developments and taboos on natural 
                                  cleaning and grooming processes (eg. a mother licking a baby) - 
                                  a civilisation`s illness, probably the first. </P>
                                <P>However then I learnt that animals frequently suffer phimosis 
                                  and persistant frenulum. (Dogs, pigs and bulls are often reported). 
                                  And so I developed a theory which is as simple as it could be true: 
                                  - Restrictive foreskins are an essential part of the survival of 
                                  many mammalian species, in that they helped to simplify and establish 
                                  the pecking order. </P>
                                <P>I believe studies on which animals suffer phimosis and frenulum 
                                  breve would open up the right ideas and the correct questions. </P>
                                <P>I speculate that phimosis and frenulum breve mainly exist among 
                                  those mammals whose mating patterns revolve round the stomping ground 
                                  (the place where bulls fight to be the alpha male) - (and the dance 
                                  floor). This speculation proposes that not only those who were weaker 
                                  in character and physique, but also the males who were anatomically 
                                  inhibited, would have less motivation to challenge and compete. 
                                  This would simplify the mating games, and help establish status, 
                                  roles and ordering in the group hierarchy. </P>

                                <P><B>Guy Cox</B> must be complimented for being first to ask this question in 1995 when he wrote: <B>&quot;<I>De 
                                    Virginibus Puerisque</I> : THE FUNCTION OF THE HUMAN FORESKIN CONSIDERED 
                                    FROM AN EVOLUTIONARY PERSPECTIVE&quot;</B><A HREF="library/xtras/refs.html#ref62">(62)</A></P>
                                <P>&quot;Abstract - The functional significance of the human male foreskin 
                                  is considered in evolutionary terms. It is postulated that there is 
                                  a lifetime's reproductive advantage in delaying the first coitus, and 
                                  hence of first childbirth, for some years after puberty, until parents 
                                  are better established as providers. Phimosis and preputial adhesions 
                                  are common in human males because they have selective advantage, tending 
                                  to impede and therefore delay the onset of sexual activity.&quot;</P>
                                <P>&quot; ... the physical symptoms of virginity ... &quot;<BR>
  &quot;Far from reducing reproductive rates, these barriers to first 
                                  intercourse must confer overall benefits on the species. This can be 
                                  explained as a consequence of the well-known fact that humans take 
                                  a disproportionately long time to reach maturity. Children are dependent 
                                  on their parents for around one quarter of their lifespan, whereas 
                                  10% or less is typical in other mammals. Even in the most primitive 
                                  societies, adolescents are not in a position to offer their offspring 
                                  an adequate chance of success until they have established themselves, 
                                  which will not happen until some years after physical puberty. ... 
                                  If they had children before this point was reached, the added drain 
                                  on their resources would probably prevent their <I>ever</I> reaching 
                                  this point, affecting the survival chances of both their first, and 
                                  all subsequent, offspring.&quot;</P>
                                <P>&quot;Conclusions : <BR>
                                  Phimosis and preputial adhesions, rare defects in other mammals, have 
                                  become common because of the selective value of postponing childbearing 
                                  for some years after physical puberty.&quot;</P>

                                <P><B>Discussion</B><BR>
                                  Firstly among animals, phimosis and persistant frenulum <B><EM>are</EM></B> widely 
                                  reported. So on this point Guy Cox is clearly wrong. <BR>
                                  More importantly<B>:</B> If phimosis did confer an advantage to 
                                  every young pair, then the lack of a foreskin would have been totally 
                                  deselected ... i.e. every young male would have phimosis. Therefore 
                                  I feel we are looking for a social or collective advantage, rather 
                                  than an individual one.</P>

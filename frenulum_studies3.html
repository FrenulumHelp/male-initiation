        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

<P> In figure 1 the principles of plastic surgery are outlined. The 
  movement of two areas of healthy skin formed by two isocoleses triangles. 
  One is designated with spots the other with stripes. By moving the 
  free extremety of point B to point B', at the same time the other extremity 
  A automatically moves to A' As a result of this transposition the skin 
  areas obtain a greater vertical diameter and a zig zag scar. 
<P> Figure 2 shows the geometrical application on an area of skin whose 
  folds run transversally, where a scar line (<FONT SIZE="2">CICATRIZ</FONT>) 
  cuts them perpendicularly. To correct this scar line it is necessary 
  to divide and divert this straight vertical line. The most effective 
  way of doing this is the "Z" as described above. 
<P> Applying this method to the frenulum of the penis has given excellant 
  results (figures 3 and 4) without any cases being unsuccessful or needing 
  to be repeated. Notice that in figure 4 the vertical cut is hidden 
  in the preputial fold and that the slanting cuts lie independantly 
  on the glans and prepuce.

&quot;Previously we used to perform circumcision or frenoplasty with 
a transverse incision sutured vertically to treat this condition. Circumcision, 
however, was thought to be too big a procedure for this condition, 
and transverse incision sutured vertically did not give a satisfactory 
result. Hence a Z plasty was performed on the patient presented."
<P>"The two triangles slid very easily, and suturing was done with 
  6-0 chromic catgut. The result was very satisfactory. The patient had 
  satisfactory sexual intercourse 15 days after operation." </P>

      EMLA cream anaesthesia for frenuloplasty<BR>

</TABLE>
<P>"Abstract - Objective: To evaluate the use of a eutectic mixture of 
  local anaesthetics (EMLA) cream as the sole anaesthetic for frenuloplasty. 
  Patients and Methods: Fifteen patients . were given topical EMLA cream 
  30 min before frenuloplasty; a Tegaderm dressing was applied to keep 
  the anaesthetic in place. The level of anaesthesia was assessed on 
  arrival in theatre using pin-prick testing and the patients were asked 
  to grade their level of pain ...<BR>
  Results: Fourteen patients had pain scores of zero and were fully anaesthetized 
  during the procedure. One patient's Tegaderm dressing was displaced 
  soon after application and he was inadequately anaesthetized on testing, 
  ... and required infiltrative lignocaine ... <BR>
  Conclusions: EMLA cream is a well-tolerated and reliable anaesthetic 
  for frenuloplasty. Using a condom to keep the cream in place would 
  reduce the small failure rate associated with the displacement of the 
  Tegaderm dressing."</P>

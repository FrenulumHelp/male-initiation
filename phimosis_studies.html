        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                                <TD><P>There has been considerable confusion over what phimosis is and

                                  whereas some phimoses will stretch others require surgery.<BR>
                                  The medical literature was researched to discover the nature of phimosis. 
                                  It was established that this is a phimotic ring of rigid skin tissue 
                                  on the inner blade of the prepuce.</P>

                            <P>Before we can discuss how phimosis may be treated, we must first 
                              establish what phimosis is.</P>
                            <P>I have often read that phimosis comes from the Greek &quot;to muzzle&quot; 
                              or that phimosis means non retractability, but what actually is phimosis, 
                              (not merely its effects), what is the reason for this non retractable 
                              state? The following studies were not selected. All available descriptive 
                              sections from the studies have been included, (vague references like 
                              &quot;the inability to retract the foreskin,&quot; have been omitted). </P>

                            <P>Apart from Clemmensen's &quot;usually&quot; and Fairgrieve's &quot;mainly&quot; 
                              all these studies indicate without any qualification that phimosis 
                              is physically observable as: a ring, or a fibrotic circular band, or 
                              a thick white fibrous ring, a sclerotic <I>(meaning scarred)</I> whitish 
                              ring, a tight ring, a narrow ring (which can become wider if scarring 
                              occurs), a fibrotic ring of tissue, a cicatricial <I>(scar left by 
                                a wound)</I> preputial ring, a hard indurated band. Since 1994 the 
                              word &quot;phimotic ring&quot; has been used in recognised medical 
                              journals. However there seems to be little information or consensus 
                              of opinion on the nature of this ring.</P>
                            <P>Private mail and interviews confirm the observations and implications 
                              that phimosis (usually) effects the inner blade of the prepuce <I>(Clemmensen, 
                                Fairgrieve, Parkash, Dewan)</I>, in the form of a white coloured ring 
                              of skin <I>(Tan, Meuli)</I> This whitish ring of skin lies around 10 
                              to 15 mms. away from the join between inner and outer foreskin on the 
                              dorsal side (the top side), the ring then follows the contours of the 
                              skin, joining approximately midway with the frenulum ventrally (underneath). 
                              The ring usually has a width less than 25 mms. <I>(Rickwood)</I>, though 
                              in severe cases (e.g. older subjects) this may be wider <I>(Fairgrieve, 
                                Hermann)</I>. (Private mail indicates the ring is usually around 2 
                              to 4 mms). </P>
                            <P>What are the exceptions which Clemmensen and Fairgrieve may have 
                              noticed? <BR>
                              a) The tubular form of an infant phimosis (which may under specific 
                              circumstances remain unstretched).<BR>
                              b) Post circumcision phimosis, (due to the circumcision scar).<BR>
                              c) An injury which could leave a scarring on the outer skin or lengthwise 
                              across the ring formed skin structure of the inner prepuce. <BR>
                              d) In special extremely abnormal circumstances (frostbite or famine?) 
                              one could imagine that the foreskin may shrivel, or a phimosis could 
                              possibly develop exactly on the join between inner and outer foreskin. <BR>
                              Any other form of phimosis must be so extremely rare that I have never 
                              heard of or seen any reported anywhere.</P>

  &quot;The results of histological examinations of other authors and

                                  severity and additional inflammations the described pathological process

                                  study with 5-year followup after complete circumcision.&quot; <I>(ibid 
                                    1994)</I><BR CLEAR="ALL">
  &quot;Our prospective study demonstrates that lichen sclerosus et atrophicus 
                                  is a relatively common cause of phimosis. The 10% incidence is comparable 
                                  to the 15% found by Kristiansen et al and the 14% reported by Chalmers 
                                  et al. Therefore this condition is not as rare as was previously reported. 
                                  Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus has been insufficiently recognised and 
                                  reported because it is not commonly known.&quot;</P>
                                <P>Meuli gives a way of diagnosing LSA: &quot;The glans demonstrated 
                                  sclerogenous ivory colored patches located perimeatally, which is the 
                                  classic manifestation that determines diagnosis.&quot; (This is a helpful 
                                  point because it means that LSA can usually be diagnosed without taking 
                                  a histological probe (a histological probe involves taking a small 
                                  sample of skin),).</P>
                                <P>To conclude we return to: OJ Clemmensen et al<BR>
                                  The histologic spectrum of prepuces from patients with phimosis. <I>1988 
                                    ibid</I><BR CLEAR="ALL">
  &quot;Since phimosis especially in young boys may regress spontaneously, 
                                  and since on the other hand LSA may evolve into squamous cell carcinoma, 
                                  we conclude that treatment of phimosis should be planned according 
                                  to its histologic pattern and not according to its monotonous clinical 
                                  appearance.&quot;</P>
                                <P>In practical terms this means that if a phimosis is primary or congenital 
                                  (from birth) then there is every reason to believe that gentle stretching 
                                  will mobilise the elastic capacity of the skin tissue. On the other 
                                  hand, when a secondary phimosis develops during childhood adolescence 
                                  or adulthood, then this will be of the lichenoid or fibrous ring type, 
                                  and this will require surgery. Most probably it will be LSA or of a 
                                  lichenoid type and such types are atrophic (degenerative), this confirms 
                                  the usual indication of surgery for LSA on the basis that to stop infections 
                                  they require anaerobic conditions. Alternatively the fibrous ring type 
                                  may occur typically in old age as one of the manifestations of the 
                                  skin losing elasticity; regardless centuries of medical research the 
                                  process of aging remains irreversible and one may expect that the ring 
                                  will progressively tighten, thus surgery is required sooner rather 
                                  than later.</P>
                                <P>Therefore the consequent question facing medical research in the 
                                  field of prevention of phimosis is: how does one prevent the &quot;fibrosing&quot; 
                                  and &quot;lichenoid&quot; processes which lead to the development of 
                                  an atrophic phimotic ring? ... This is possibly a question of rejuvenation 
                                  of skin tissue in general: one may speculate that cleanliness, sunshine, 
                                  oil and exercise hint at an answer. </P>

                                <P>Taboos within taboos (each one more appetising than the last!) In 
                                  1996 the British Journal of Urology published a study by a man called 
                                  Taylor who wished to show the nature and value of the &quot;normal&quot; 
                                  foreskin. It is as unbelievable as it is true that in order to do this 
                                  he examined the foreskins of 21 (or 22) <I><B>corpses</B></I>. </P>
                                <P>This study  describes a ridged band which appears identical 
                                  to the band I recognise as a phimosis. The question this study opens 
                                  up for me is: When rigor mortis sets in do all males develop phimosis? 
                                  (The tendency for a fibrous phimotic ring to develop in old age as 
                                  the skin shrinks and dries would tend to confirm this).</P>
                                <P>Ironically Taylor describes the phimotic ring with more accuracy than any other medical study :&quot;a transversely-ridged        band of mucosa 10-15 mm wide, lies against the true skin        edge, forming the outer surface of the tip of the prepuce. In        the dorsal midline. the `ridged band' lies above the level of        the adjacent `smooth' mucosa and merges smoothly, on either        side, with the frenulum of the prepuce. When magnified, the        ridged mucosa has a pebbled or coral-like appearance.        ... The remainder of the preputial lining        between the `ridged band' and the glans is smooth and lax.&quot; </P>

  &quot;...&quot;relative&quot; phimosis, this means when on the flaccid 
                                  organ there is a large quasi normal sized preputial orifice, however 
                                  during erection this forms a ring shaped bridle. During erection, this 
                                  bridle may be the cause of an impossibility in retraction, or result 
                                  in a paraphimosis; pain due to the constricted passage (rapports par 
                                  etranglement?) over the base of the glans, and tiny rips which can

                                  the personal reports which are available to me, when the bridle is 
                                  almost invisible or not easy to see then paraphimosis or an impossibility 
                                  to retract would not occur.</P>

  &quot;During the physical examination, most males don't get an erection, 
                                  so it is difficult to find out if the foreskin will retract over the 
                                  erect glans; therefore, this must be elicitated by history.&quot;</P>
                                <P>This is an important point in any study on statistics. Only occasionally 
                                  have the men in such studies been consulted about their condition, 
                                  they are generally checked objectively in the flaccid state. In such 
                                  a medical check relative phimosis would be overlooked. This indicates 
                                  that a significant extra percentage should be added to most estimations 
                                  of the statistics for these cases of relative phimosis.</P>

                                <P>Why does the phimotic ring form at this point just behind the tip, 
                                  on the inner blade of the foreskin?: The tubular nose shape 
                                  of the infant prepuce bears no relationship to the position of the 
                                  phimotic ring. Therefore I am led to believe that it is a phase in 
                                  the embryonic development which leads to the vulnerability of this 
                                  particular contour or strata of skin.</P>

Much modern medical information on circumcision (from popular literature to reports in medical journals), recommends that the best care for a foreskin is to leave it alone. These reports are all based on &Oslash;ster's misinterpreted study. &Oslash;ster made his report following 7 years of education and monitoring. Such care and attention obviously results in less problems.</FONT></P></TD>

Routine Medical Checks</FONT></B>
                              <P>Routine pre-puberty medical examinations currently check such things 
                                as eyesight, hearing, heart and lungs and for the proper descent of 
                                the testes. To this should now be added at least one check to ensure 
                                that the boy does not suffer from adhesions, phimosis or a tight frenulum.</P>
                              <P>The boy should be asked to retract his own foreskin to the extent 
                                that the frenulum can be checked. (In addition the circumcised boy 
                                must be checked for skin-bridges and frenulum breve). This check is 
                                necessary before puberty in order to minimise the amount of treatment 
                                required after puberty, once problems have arisen.</P>
                              <P>A medical check would be most profitable as regularly as other organs 
                                were checked, not only before puberty, but also after puberty. With 
                                our present cultural attitudes on preventative medicine, it would be 
                                appropriate if checking became recognised and understood as routine 
                                procedure - and became a central part of our cultures initiation into 
                                manhood. </P>

                              <P><B>Education</B>: Since January 1997 pictures of                                     foreskin retraction are available on internet. It would be realistic                                     to print pictures of the erect penis showing the retraction of the                                     foreskin in books on sexual education, this would minimise the necessity                                     to find education through pornography.

                                The Optimal Way to Check</FONT></B> </P>
                              <P>The optimal practical idea is suggested by Dr. med Jenny Splieth.. 
                                "Mothers should check this, they see their childrens erections" 
                                and again, "It would be best for parents to check their son's erections 
                                during infancy ... this would be simplest to do at bath times." <A HREF="library/xtras/refs.html#ref22">(22)</A>
                              <P>Doctors are usually unable to check a child`s erection and thus 
                                are unable to see the effects of, for example, a relative phimosis 
                                or frenulum breve. It is easy (and I would argue as natural as bathing 
                                him), to check your own son for problems. This involves simple observation 
                                of the spontaneous bath time erections every boy has, if he is able 
                                to freely retract and replace his own foreskin then he is in good 
                                health. 
                              <P>Parents have asked me : If a boy is (unsexually) playing with his 
                                erect penis (e.g. during bathing times, at one year old), does this 
                                mean that he's healthy? The answer is: Yes! and this must be the best 
                                way to check. Simply look : Is the foreskin moving freely?</P>
                              <P>If parents made an early check on a boy's erect penis, this would 
                                be far more effective and efficient than a doctor's check on the boy's 
                                flaccid penis. If after three years old a boys foreskin does not retract, 
                                he needs <A

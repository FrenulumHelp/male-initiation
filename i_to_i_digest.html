        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

  <P>UNDER CONSTRUCTION
  <P>At the other extreme, in large parts of Europe, Canada, Australia 
   etc., problems are usually treated after they have arisen, following 
   experiences of pain, difficulty or discomfort during masturbation, 
   or after the first unsuccessful attempts with love-making. 
  <P>There are two clinical complications which occurr often during 
   masturbation at the beginning of puberty due to a mild phimotic 
   ring. This can get stuck behind the glans (paraphimosis), or repeated 
   abrasion against the glans can lead to infections.
  <P>During the first steps to manhood genital pain or difficulty can 
   have far reaching consequences. Quite apart from the physical problems 
   a young boy experiencing pain or difficulty during masturbation 
   will be worried. Even the bravest young warrior on the first steps 
   to manhood, confronted with a problem with his penis will be scared. 
   He will be embarrassed, confused and worried. 
  <P>He may reassure himself thinking everyone is normal, without really 
   understanding that normal men can see and touch their entire penis. 
   Alternatively he will develop a growing awareness that something 
   is permanently wrong with his penis or with touching his foreskin 
   or with masturbation - He may even accept taht something is permanently 
   wrong with his penis, and he simply has to live with it. Worry and 
   confusion will often take unrealistic dimensions ... 
  <P>As human nature is, he will put off confronting the problem. He 
   will then often simply prefer not to talk about this with his parents 
   preferring to wait until of an age to ask a doctor. 
  <P>However, in some cases our brave explorer simply does not realise 
   that retracting his foreskin is possible, normal or desirable. He 
   intuitively avoids any approaching pain and he adapts to his limitation 
   without experiencing it as a difficulty.<I> </I> He grows accustomed 
   to his body as it is, never questioning nature. His sexual behaviour 
   becomes anatomically inhibited. 
  <P> If he is lucky he will discover his condition following failure 
   or pain during first intercourse. However, often he will simply 
   enter adulthood adapting his self image and behaviour to accommodate 
   his anatomical inhibition, thus providing a basis for confusion 
   and distress in all his intimate relationships<I>.</I> 
  <P>When boys are left alone with such problems it means that a considerable 
   percentage are going to have a fully distorted first impression 
   of sex and manhood. An absurdly mismanaged passage to manhood, arguably 
   more bizarre than any primitive custom.

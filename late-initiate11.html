        <P><FONT SIZE="2">The concept that an anatomical deficiency in the erection can influence the 
  sexuality appears to contradict every advance in understanding which our culture 
  has made over the last century. - Psychological research has concentrated on parental 
          and environmental phenomenon, and the urological disciplines do not 
          include sexual behaviour. Scientific research has overlooked this area 
          of human sexuality. </FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                            <P>When eventually the great day of awakening dawns, this often entails 
                              first being rather flabbergasted, shocked, inevitably the question 
                              "Am I alone?" and then the cry "Why was this not treated in childhood 
                              - Why did no-one tell me?!" 
                            <P>You probably feel fooled and looking rather stupid. Yes its embarrassing 
                                        - you are looked at with disbelief by everyone you know, (you didn`t 
                                        dare tell anyone? - I`m not surprised!)
                                        Against 
                                        the weight of accepted opinion it may often appear less painful to 
                                        "repress and survive".
                                        
                            <P>Its important to get your brain in gear: - no disturbance need ultimately 
                                        have bad effects, - it was an experience - life`s full of them and 
                                        good or bad they can be enriching. In practice the first step in turning any problem into an enriching 
                                        experience is an awareness of this experience. Trust your experience, 
                                        it happened and you know it, even if everything and everyone around you reject the 
                                        possibility.
                            <P>And then what would certainly help is to follow your heart and the 
                                        next girl.

                                      <P>Maybe you think, it is simply ridiculous that this was not treated in childhood, 
                                        and if you`d have been circumcised as a child then it wouldn`t have 
                                        happened, ... but please don`t turn into a pro-circer, ... it would be equally ridiculous 
                                        to circumcise a child who has nothing wrong with them, ... so how are 
                                        we going to tell the difference?  
                                        ... surely the point is that, as a child, you  should have been
                                        checked or received some information!
                                      <P>What makes the experience ridiculous is that men have obviously 
                                        been having similar experiences for countless generations, so why didnt they say anything? Were they all so embarrassed or maybe egoistical that they only thought of their own personal problems and penis, and just didn't care about other men and boys and the next generation? 
                                      <P>Its not the sort of thing everyone wants to stand up in public with, 
                                        but by sharing your experience either in the <A HREF="http://f51.parsimony.net/forum204493/" TARGET="_blank">forum</A> or privately in <A HREF="contact.html#start">e.mail with me</A>, I 
                                        can include it in future updates (see <A HREF="letters.html#start">email collection </A>), and so give the experience a value and 
                                        hopefully help encourage a more caring initiation from our culture for future generations.

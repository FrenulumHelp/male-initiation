                                    other traditional cures performed by many ancient cultures.

                                  <P><B>The normal foreskin can move freely and be retracted without 
                                  any difficulty. A normal man can see and touch the entire penis,

                                <P><B>Phimosis, or &quot;the inability to freely 
                                    retract the foreskin&quot; - inhibits the relationship between 
                                    the foreskin and the glans. </B><B>This functionally restricts the erection, causing pain and 
                                      difficulty during masturbation or intercourse.</B> </P>
                                <P><B>Due to the difficulties experienced when attempting to retract his 
                                  foreskin, a boy may believe this act to be unnatural. As with many other inhibitions people avoid pain and difficulty; thus many boys and men simply do not realise that their erection is, in effect, anatomically 'inhibited'.</B> </P>

                                  on statistics</A> a figure of at least 8% is reported for 
                                  adolescents who have problems of foreskin retraction in the non-erect 
                                  state. 
                                Most human males in the world receive no care at all for this. 
                                <P><strong>But to our astonishment and amusement we discover : farm animals are examined early for such problems as part 
                                  of the Breeding Soundness Examination, because "Copulation failure

                                <P>For humans, either a 
                                  routine circumcision is performed, or the culture does absolutely 
                                  nothing at all, until after a problem has occurred usually after 
                                  several years difficulty. Operations occur typically during puberty 
                                  or after the first attempts at intercourse.                    
                                <P>The full extent of the effects of phimosis have 
                                                        only recently come to light, due to the anonymity of Internet 
                                                        where adult men have been able to relate their experiences openly 
                                                        for the first time. 
                                <P><B>This site researches the erectile effects of phimosis, analyses 
                                  the information from over two thousand personal experiences, and 
                                  then describes the influence of foreskin conditions on the sexuality. </B></P>
                                <P><B>I argue that a difficult or painful foreskin 
                                  restricts the erection and when untreated this inhibits the sexual behaviour 
                                  of a man. These pages illustrate aspects of human nature and experience which have never before 
                                  been discussed.</B></P>

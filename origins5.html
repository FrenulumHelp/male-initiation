        <P><FONT SIZE="2">Experts have been unable to understand the origin of the practice of routine 
          male circumcision. Most of the literature shows no awareness 
          of phimosis - its frequency - or the sexual and erectile problems which can be cured by circumcision. If routine circumcision 
          had been introduced for this most obvious reason of eliminating difficult 
          foreskins; then the importance of an alternative modern method, suitable to our culture's attitudes in this day and age, would be clear. </FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

3) Why did the practice continue?</B></FONT>
                            <P>How any practice becomes anchored in a culture 
                              is that firstly it must become socially acceptable and normal. During the first stages of the development, some people may well have looked upon 
                              the idea as a ridiculous or frivolous mutilation, while among others 
                              it would become socially acceptable, desirable and normal. and it is 
                              where this sense of acceptability and "normality" existed that the 
                              practice became established.</P>
                            <P>Previous to the measure becoming established in a fixed cultural 
                              form, it could easily have been discontinued, forgotten, reintroduced, 
                              etc.. </P>
                            <P>Distinct reasons for the continuation of this tradition are related 
                              in the existing literature. Sometimes the operation combined with, 
                              for example: initiation rites, religious ideas and celebrations, ritual 
                              sacrifice, national identity, sexual identity; specific to some peoples 
                              were associations such as reincarnation or high priestly distinction; 
                              or often simply to continue the respected traditions because 'our fathers did it before us', and when any 
                              of these associations occurred, the practice became anchored as part 
                              of the culture's traditions.</P>
                            <P>Special note should be made of <A HREF="bryk.html#start">Bryk</A>`s 
                              ideas on the natural inclination <FONT SIZE="3">to &quot;denudation&quot; 
                                of the glans</FONT> which offers a basis for all other developments. </P>
                            <P>Other factors which may have contributed to the continuation cover 
                              such diversity as climate, sparseness or density of the population, 
                              probably even local inter marriage customs, method of gathering 
                              food (e.g. segregated male hunting parties). On the other hand: 
                              Bettelheim's <A HREF="library/xtras/refs.html#ref5">(5)</A> menstruation 
                              envy; and the modern psychologists &quot;regression&quot; may all 
                              have played a part in why this custom became established among some 
                              cultures. </P>
                            <P>In fact probably the only theme which has nothing to do with the 
                              continuation of the practice are foreskin conditions: then once the 
                              foreskin was routinely removed, it no longer caused problems, and could 
                              no longer have been a motivating factor.</P>
                            <P>Once it had become established, if there was no reason to stop using 
                              a tried and tested method, then it would be continued, in the same 
                              way as other customs, then survival and stability depended on such 
                              traditions.</P>
                            <P>Open to discussion - (as always) <BR>

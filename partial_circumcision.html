        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. My concern is the early prevention of phimosis. The late correction of adult phimosis was never my interest. My belief is that once the medical profession realise the need, they will develop hundreds of new methods of treatment which I cant even imagine ... Therefore treatment  is  purely an appendix on this site, however, because I have no specific bias, my research allowed a rare objective survey of the many posibilities. </FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site offers  detailed information 
          on  individual problem related treatment, often advising simple, cheap, minimal and specific surgery and time honoured solutions taken from traditional methods including partial circumcision, dorsal slit and frenular incision and tying.

                            Traditional time tested cures of partial circumcision, dorsal slit, 
                            or frenular incision are rarely recommended by modern doctors. </P>
                            <P>Modern technical engineering and plastics have enabled pro circ 
                              doctors to develop and proliferate modern methods for performing 
                              full circumcision on even the tiny infant penis. The Tara Clamp 
                              has recently been added to Plastiibell and gomco clamp and is praised 
                              as being able to perform the &quot;perfect&quot; cut. 
                            <P>Partial circumcision is a far simpler method (e.g. a clamp to 
                              trap the glans inside before guillotining off the overhang of the 
                              foreskin), and together with dorsal slit and frenular incision they 
                              are fully efficient methods of treating foreskin conditions.</P>

                            <P><B>If you want a partial circumcision my advice is : Find a Jewish 
                              Doctor </B><BR>
                              I love simple answers and here is one. wish Id have realised 6 years 
                              ago when I wanted a partial circ. it must be right ... find a Jewish 
                              doctor. 
                            <P>The doctors who are practised and perfected with partial circumcision 
                              are Jewish doctors. The Jewish circumcision is a partial circumcision. 
                              Its not only 8 day old children who are circumcised its every convert 
                              or intermarried adult. And they have simple (because 5000 yrs ago things 
                              were) and obviously tried and tested methods
                            <P>There are even added advantages, .. you will certainly receive a 
                              respectful caring (even religious) attitude from your doctor, possibly even with interest 
                              in sexual problems you've had ... 
                            <P>Go to your local Jewish hospital - (cities often have one) - or you  need to get in touch with your local synagogue who I feel sure they would  welcome the question, then this operation for the Jews is at the basis  of the covenant with God, (the primary bond between the Jews and God,  infact the bond which made them, as far as they were concerned, "Gods  people")

                            <P>For the first ten days after the operation the stitches will be 
                              uncomfortable as they dig in to the glans - in addition it will 
                              be advisable to retract the foreskin every day to prevent skin bridges 
                              from forming. (see <A HREF="circumcision/post_circumcision.html#start">post

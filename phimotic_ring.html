        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                                        out from underneath the penis, and curves round over the front of the 
                                        inner foreskin, like a noose. </P>
                                    <P><A HREF="phimosis_research.html#start">Phimosis Research</A> gives 
                                      detailed information on the exact positioning of this phimotic ring. 
                                      (To diagnose definately, underneath the foreskin is not so tight, you 
                                      will notice that you even have a little flap which you can flip away). </P>
                                    <P> The phimotic ring is by nature less elastic and expands relatively 
                                      less than the rest of the foreskin, so any difficulty with retraction 
                                      when flaccid is magnified when erect. The anatomical and sexual effects 
                                      are varied and depend on the tightness and elasticity of the ring. </P>

                            ring (developing later in life) will tighten. <A HREF="phimosis_treatment.html#start">Phimosis

                            types of ring. 
                          <P><A NAME="types"></A>Most infants have a ring and this usually stretches 
                            naturally during childhood. Sometimes the ring does not stretch, in 
                            addition it can reappear for a number of different reasons, at any 
                            time of life. 
                          <P>The development of a ring in mid-life is sometimes an indication 
                            for diabetes. In old age together with the general drying and tightening 
                            of the skin, fibrotic elements lead to a deterioration of the rings 
                            elasticity. The ring is also prone to rip and then as it joins, due 
                            to the scar it will become tighter. 
                          <P>The connection between the ring and LSA is particularly convoluted. 
                            Often the abrasive action of the ring during masturbation and the warm, 
                            damp, dark, enclosed area between the foreskin and glans can lead to 
                            LSA. On the other hand due to external influences (partner, soaps, 
                            side effects of other medicines,) LSA may occur and this leads to degeneration 
                            of the skin tissue when subsequently a ring will develop.

                                  <P> The phimotic ring varies in tightness and it can have areas of 
                                    different elasticity and tensile strength. It is by nature less elastic 
                                    and expands relatively less than the rest of the foreskin, so any difficulty 
                                    with retraction when flaccid is magnified when erect. The anatomical 
                                    and sexual effects depend on the tightness of the ring. 
                                  <P>Very extreme degrees (often called pinhole phimosis) cause urinary 
                                    complications or infections in childhood, and therefore are often recognised 
                                    and treated early. 
                                  <P>A partial phimosis will reveal part of the glans but penetration 
                                    will often cause frustration as the foreskin bags up in a barrier, 
                                    sometime being forced painfully behind the glans causing paraphimosis. 
                                  <P>A relative phimosis only becomes obvious during erection, and it 
                                    usually starts being problematic at the beginning of puberty as it 
                                    rubs over the glans during masturbation which hurts and causes soreness, 
                                    often leading to infections.

                            Extreme degrees often cause urinary complications in childhood, for 
                            example not being able to aim, spraying and ballooning, and lets face 
                            it, after urination, not being able to shake all the urine out, (and 
                            the consequent wet trousers). In addition, due to the hot damp environment 
                            between the foreskin and the glans, infections can easily develop.</P>
                          <P>Should a boy be unfortunate enough to arrive at puberty with a pinhole 
                            phimosis during erection the foreskin is held firmly in place over

                            described as a straight jacket. <A HREF="library/medicus/beauge.html#start">Beauge</A> describes in detail various methods of masturbation boys use without 
                            retraction.</P>
                          <P>Throughout adolescence as behavioural patterns develop, youths grow 
                            accustomed to their condition, either believing themselves to be normal, 
                            or if they do recognise their phimosed status some men obviously grow 
                            to prefer it. Intercourse is possible though this depends on the degree 
                            of lubrication and openness of the vagina and the brutality of penetration. 
                          <P>Reports suggest either little sexual activity or a one sided appetite. 
                            It is possible that at times late treatment would create greater disturbances 
                            than it would cure. Men who are aware of their condition often complain 
                            that the only problem they have is other people telling them they have 
                            a problem. 
                          <P>"Somehow I like the idea of the glans being hidden and stimulation 
                            being more of a challenge. ... the tightness of the skin is very exciting 
                            to me when it is played with or when I masturbate. ... It does have 
                            a smell most of the time, but it is a very nice male smell that hardly

                            With a partial phimosis when erect part of the glans is visible and 
                            some mobility is possible during masturbation. 
                          <P>Partial phimosis often first presents a problem by intercourse and 
                            (more than with pinhole phimosis), penetration requires lubrication, 
                            otherwise the foreskin ruffles up in a barrier (adding much frustration 
                            to the first sexual encounters). If the ring is a little looser or 
                            the vagina a little tighter, it may be forced behind the glans for 
                            the first time causing paraphimosis. 
                          <P><A HREF="paraphimosis.html#start">Paraphimosis</A> is when the phimotic

                            typically during the first explorations at the beginning of puberty 
                            or on first love making and is considered a medical emergency.

                            The condition which is loosely referred to as &quot;tight foreskin&quot;, 
                            indicates a degree of this phimotic band which is hardly noticeable 
                            when flaccid. However when masturbating normally ("alternate back and 
                            forth movement" <A
HREF="library/medicus/beauge.html#start">(<I>Beauge</I>)</A> ) relative 
                            phimosis causes pain and difficulty. 
                          <P>As the foreskin is retracted the ring scrapes over the coronal ridge 
                            of the glans. As the ring repeatedly rubs against the glans, the soreness 
                            and abrasion often leads to inflammations and as the process continues 
                            these can easily cause infections, (LSA or balanitis). This development 
                            is frequently reported.

                            When the phimotic ring is put under stress; (through stretching exercises 
                            or during masturbation when the ring passes repeatedly over the coronal 
                            ridge), it can easily rip. These rips appear to occur lengthwise between 
                            the ridges of the phimotic ring. As the rips heal, they leave scars 
                            which cause a tightening of the phimosis.</P>

                            remains forward, there is a tendency for the adolescent to forget to 
                            wash the area. With a pinhole phimosis reports suggest washing is performed 
                            by flushing the area out and squeezing, and/or using a q-tip. or holding 
                            the foreskin closed when urinating, to "swill out all the smegma".</P>

                            Some medical studies misquote others and give statistics of 1%, there 
                            are other documents giving this figure which have no references Even 
                            if the statistics were only 1%, this would be too many to ignore.</P>
                          <P>There are no reliable studies which show less than 2.4% and this 
                            statistic was the result of a seven year long selected test study.

  sexuality appears to contradict every advance in understanding which our culture 
  has made over the last century. - Psychological research has concentrated on parental 
          and environmental phenomenon, and the urological disciplines do not 
          include sexual behaviour. Scientific research has overlooked this area 
          of human sexuality. </FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

If he imagines he is a sexually efficient male, only an inexperienced 
                    woman (or a man with a similar condition) could confirm his belief. 
                    As situations and lovers are repeatedly mis-sensed, and he himself 
                    is misunderstood, his disoriented sexual identity is accepted and confirmed 
                    by himself and others.                   
                            
                          <P>The inhibition leads to impressions and reactions which our culture 
                              interprets exclusively in terms of childhood psychological problems. 
                              An attempt to come to terms with his sexuality will usually lead the 
                              sufferer to misunderstand himself in terms of classical psychology, 
                              and then even attempt to confront his situation purely on an environmental 
                              or parental level, - making his situation infinitely worse.
                            <P>Against a background of nervousness or disturbances from nature 
                              or upbringing, any specific anatomically based disturbance would 
                              be unnoticeable. [Therapists should be aware that even if environmental 
                              problems appear to predominate, a short conversation to confirm 
                              the patient is aware of foreskin retraction will eliminate the possibility 
                              of this extra hidden complication. Please see. <A HREF="library/surround/common_sense.html#start">The

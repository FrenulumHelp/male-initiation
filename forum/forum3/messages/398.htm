Hello CO !<P>
Its not your parents fault - how can they know that skin<BR>
bridges could develop? no doctor told them - This is all very common<BR>
for all forms of phimosis and your problem as well - My opinion : -<BR>
it is the entire inhibited culture and the medical profession<BR>
which is to blame - and not even individual doctors - no-one tells<BR>
them either!!!<P>
It is a ridiculous situation when one is stuck in a century long taboo<P>
keep in touch - tell us what happens.<P>

>Hi Robin,<BR>
>yes, i'm circumcised. I am not sure how i got it though. I  think that it was my parents fault for not taking care of it. For  awhile i thought it looked...different, but i wasn't really sure.. and i  was right.<BR>
> <BR>
>yeah, i was already thinking that. Why didn't anyone know. I  have been to the docters plenty of times. And just about a year in half ago i  had a physical, and i was checked maybe for cancer, but i am not sure, and the  docter didn't say anything to me. Same with my parents, they should have  known..but instead i had to find out on my own. .<BR>

>thanks for helping me.

Hi Dave,<P>
I feel there is lots I could say, and yours is quite a tricky bunch of questions.<P>
Now, the problem is that I had fever today, so I am really stretching my health at present, Im not online at home (I live in the middle of a field), I come here (to a friends broadband) once a week - I have saved your letter and will give you a full reply next week - promise -<P>
I feel that the adhesion (which at present I presume is a skin bridge which has formed in a sheet) needs operating on.<P>
The orgasm question worries you as well - do you realise that ejaculation and orgasm are different mechanisms for the male - I sometimes have orgasm without ejaculation or without even an erection!! (the world gets more and more curious) - I achieve this orgasm simply by holding back coming, it takes a bit of practice, but maybe worth you experimenting with for a week or so.<P>
I will consider again your condition over the week for the moment my advice is look at porn look at women wank however much you want, but stop yourself before you come --- OK try it<P>
will be back next week<P>
honest<P>

>Please help!<BR>
>This is going to sound really fucked up, this is the situation I find myself in! I really do need advice!<BR>
>I have never had an orgasm in my life. I masterbate frequently, and I CAN ejaculate and experience a little pleasure from, but I definately do not orgasm. This has affected my relationships in the past in a big way, in fact it's affected my life in a pretty big way. I feel so depressed about it as you can imagine.<BR>
>When I was younger I had phimosis. Through many months of stretching I managed to make it retractable. Now though, I have realised the foreskin is bonded directly to the glans (no frenulum).<BR>
>When I masterbate, I get very turned on to start with, but it seems that the more turned on I get the tighter and tighter the bond gets and it seems to cause the ejaculatory reflex on each tug (ie. the muscles at the base of the penis clench really hard). This seems to prevent me ever reaching intense please or an orgasm. It's almost like the pleasure is reset when the muscles are clenched, yet I am still turned on and frustrated. I can finish myself off by clenching the muscles at the base and furiously wanking, resulting in ejaculation but no orgasm.<BR>
>This really REALLY gets me down. I dont know what to do!!<BR>
>Has anyone ever experienced this? Has anyone else ever had phimosis with an adhesion where the fenulum should be?<BR>
>What I don't understand is that people who have phimosis seem to have no trouble reaching climax. But for me, its like I need to have the foreskin sliding over the glans to get pleasure - yet this is what ultimately causes the pain and ejaculatory reflex.<BR>
>Any advice greatly appreciated!!!!!!!!!<BR>

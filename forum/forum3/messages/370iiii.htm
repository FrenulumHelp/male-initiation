As an answer to: <A HREF="57.htm">Re: Education</A> written by JB  Jason  Broadway at 02 Aug 2006 00:15:48:<P>

>>>>>> JB here <BR>
I amy sound like a anti circ person mainly due to the fact i was circed and regret it. Not sure if iam correct in saying that its the only way to go there are good in both i guess. I just was not asked about my status when it happend. maybe a forum for the Anti Circ folks and the Pro Circ folks where they can air there thoughts and let the ones who are uncut decide . thats a thought . again EDUCATION <P>
Hi Jason,<BR>
You know I find it real difficult to understand you at times. I have no idea what this means ”Not sure if iam correct in saying that its the only way to go there are good in both i guess.”<P>
You normally would be anti circ with your history. Thank you for trying to be broad minded and see other points of view.<P>
I believe there are independent forums for anti and pro circ views, Im sure there must be. I could link to both. However both these views are biased and extremist, and when you add two extremist views together you simply don’t get a whole picture.  <P>
>>>>>>> I am with you more research needs to be done whats the sensation of guys cut vs uncut and how that affext sex . <P>
Im not interested in such research. There has already been a lot of research done on this. For me the actual vital point is the influence of phimosis on the foreskin imparticularly the sexual consequences of phimosis. <P>
>>>>the www.nocirc.org is one who has a lot of info on the care of uncut childern <P>
But doesn’t www.nocirc.org follow the anti circ party line of it being perfectly OK to have a phimosis till late teens? I am dead against this sort of misinformation. This is not “care of uncut children” - this is total neglect.<P>
>>>> and guys who are cut and want restoration can go to www.noharmm.org for that info <P>
Im sure www.noharmm.org also follows the party line and advises phimosis is OK till late teens --=- but if you can give me an accurate link to the pages on restoration then I could write it in my links.html<P>
>> I understand that in Europe at there schools the doctor checks on the progress each year <P>
This is totally untrue. Only in Germany and Sweden do they check kids once. In Germany this happens around the age of 6. If your ideas were true, I would have had no reason or cause to start this project and site. <P>
Im afraid its difficult to understand what you write at times, you need a splelchequer, and just reread what you wrote and punctuate a bit better, really its tough going, trying to follow you.<P>
>>> But my question is so what what if it dosent ever pull back whats wrong with that as well that i need to learn as well and there is NO infor on what that feels like at all so the phimosed guys need to speak up on that experience as well not the usual oh it feels ok ? JB <P>
I have been collecting reports on this for 12 years. Such reports are the basis of my site “Male Initiation and the Phimosis Taboos”. I really suggest you read something about this.<P>
But this is not such a simplistic subject as the anti circers or pro circers make out. The reality of the problems and individual cures and prevention is more complex. You will require a bit of time and concentration to get the real picture. I suggest you start at the welcome page and read through the 4 chapter summaries. Particularly chapter 1 <A HREF="../../../phimosis.html">The Conditions</A> with its links to pages specialising in the effects of each condition, and then chapter 2  <A HREF="../../../i_to_i.html">From Innocence to Ignorance</A> and the link to “Passages to Manhood” which is a file full of quotes from individual experiences.<P>
Really JB, the information is available and has been for 10 years on my site. Countless men have spoken up … its just waiting for you to read.<P>
Cheers<BR>

>Hello all,<BR>
>    I just went into the hospital for a Frenuloplasty yesterday. I just came across this forum and thought I would share my experience. Needless to say I was very nervous about the mixture of sharp instuments and my Penis. So far the anticipation of the operation was the worst part. I woke up from the anestesia yesterday at about 1:00 pm and I have not felt a lick of pain yet, almost 24 hours later. I guess they did something called a "nerve block" and my penis is still somewhat numb. It took a while for me to pee because of the numbness I guess, but everything seems fine now although when I do pee some of it doesn't go strait, so I've been going in a jar. It's kind of scary to see stiches in my penis but like I said I have not experienced any discomfort thus far. I'll let you all know how things are in a couple days.<BR>

Dear:<BR>
I'have a frenulumtomy. My frenulum never waS TROUBLE IT SELF, but may doctor advice the cut.  since the time after the cut, i and may wise are very happy in our sexual relations.<P>
my sons are uncut, but all had frenulumtoy with lasser when their penis were peeled by the  sinequieothomy, about their teen years old. <P>
Sincerely, I advice the frenulumthomy for all males, and if it is possible, the circumsicion or at the less, the sinequeothomy after the first year old of the male baby.

As an answer to: <A HREF="348.htm">Frenulum Breve - Phimosis feedback</A> written by Hugh at 11 May 2006 18:58:47:<P>

Hello Hugh<P>
thanks for the detailed letter. Must say first I am not a doc. <P>
It sounds to me like you have a mixture of frenulum breve and a<BR>
phimotic ring. Simply, the frenulum will be practically impossible to<BR>
stretch - the phimotic ring may very possibly respond to stretching.<BR>
However trying to stretch it fighting as well against the frenulum<BR>
will be tough work. However - because your phimotic ring allows<BR>
retraction when flaccid, then you could first have a frenuloplasty to<BR>
cure the frenulum with this operation.<P>
Do I make sense? You seem to have both conditions, and this is not<BR>
unusual. As you are particularly interested in stretching, I will<BR>
expand there, you could ask your Dr: Mackay for betamethasone or any<BR>
other skin stretching steroid, this will help stretching the ring. The<BR>
frenulum, there are wild rumours about stretching the frenulum I have<BR>
no bona fida report of this, and your frenulum is from your<BR>
description very short it would need to be stretched twice as long, so<BR>
I say thats impossible, you must get it operated, and then you are<BR>
just fighting one problem, stretching the ring.<P>
Then a word on frenuloplasty, I have a new page on my site from a guy<BR>
in Holland with a brilliant and the simplest cure for frenulum breve called<BR>
"tying the frenulum" - you will find this as 6th link on<BR>
www.male-initiation.net/frenulum_index.html  it is worth looking, the<BR>
page is very disorganised at present and Im trying to develop it with the<BR>
guy who wrote it ... itll take a while ... maybe 3 weeks till I have a<BR>
special page on just this one subject ... but its maybe worth you looking<BR>
and understanding it ... and maybe even suggesting it to your doctor.<P>
There is another reason why men discover late - our language is<BR>
confusing, we think the end of the penis is called a gland, a hidden producer of hormonal<BR>
essences - but its not, its called a "glans" and has nothing to do with<BR>
thyroid gland or perinneal gland etc<P>
You say help in research - I need help as well with just getting kids<BR>
monitored before puberty, throughout the Western medical world.<P>
Help in research - you say theres no whiteness in your ring, just<BR>
seems normal skin colour? - if you move your finger nail across the<BR>
inner foreskin and then across this ring, do you feel if it is dead<BR>
skin and insensitive? or does it seem sensitive?<P>
You are 25 and you discovered late ... dont you feel this should have been<BR>
checked earlier in your life? ... are you angry, or upset, or feel<BR>
neglected?<P>
anyway answer if you want or can - take care - good luck - keep in<BR>
touch<P>

>Dear Dr Robin Srtuart<BR>
> <BR>
>I am 25 and I have recently used your website to self diagnose myself with "Frenulum Breve / Phimosis". <BR>
> <BR>
>My late diagnosis is in line with your observations as to why it takes some men so long to realize that there is a problem. Specifically my conditions are as follows: <BR>
> <BR>
>When flaccid the foreskin can be pulled back although because the "ring is smaller than the gland, pulling back is tight and a 'bottleneck' like maneuver. Pulling back is a recent discovery for me. <BR>
> <BR>
>When pulled back the Frenulum is tight but bearable. All of the foreskin can be rolled over (inside exposed) exposing all of the gland. <BR>
> <BR>
>The frenulum (zip like join) appears to be higher on the gland (closer to the penile) than normal. So when flaccid the natural tendency is for the skin to pull forward unless it is forced right over the gland. <BR>
> <BR>
>You make specific mention of a "monotonous clinical appearance" of a thin strip of tight tissue which is embedded in the inner foreskin). There does not appear to be any white tissue forming a ring, the tightness seems to be caused from the ring itself being too small in circumference to start with. <BR>
> <BR>
>When the penis becomes erect the foreskin remains forward covering 97% of the glands. When erect it is not possible to pull the foreskin back over the gland. An attempt only exposes 85% of the glands. <BR>
> <BR>
>If the foreskin is pulled back when flaccid and the penis begins to become erect the ring becomes very tight making an unusual hour glass shape. There is painful tension on the frenulum that feels like it could tear. <BR>
> <BR>
>I have made contact with a Urologist: here in Auckland New Zealand. I have found your treatment recommendations valuable. I hope that I can further contribute to your research. For my benefit, based off the above, what treatment do you recommend. <BR>
> <BR>
>I am specifically interested in stretching treatment because the condition has been a late discovery. Perhaps years of no pull back could be corrected with proper stretching treatment? Or does it appear that my self diagnosis was correct and I do have Frenulum Breve / Phimosis. <BR>
> <BR>
>Any contact for a second opinion or other surgeon recommendations would be most appreciated. Further contact may also be useful for the website. <BR>
> <BR>
>Kind regards. <BR>

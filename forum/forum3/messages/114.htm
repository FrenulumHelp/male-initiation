Hi David,<P>
You are describing a typical secondary phimosis. <P>
The very vulnerable ring around the end of the foreskin is - roughly speaking - very narrow at birth and stretches until puberty - this is called a primary phimosis - or primary phimotic ring. Under various circumstances - infections, diabetes, and very common in old age - a so called secondary ring occurs, in the same place, influencing the same skin tissue. Whereas a primary ring will stretch and regenerate a secondary ring will degenerate and tighten. You almost certainly had some sort of infection and you can be thankful it was treated before puberty.<P>
Let me now ask a return question. I would be very interested if you can actually remember your feelings when you were a 9 yr. old and slowly started discovering that your foreskin was closing ... apart from the embarrassment in peeing competitions ... any memories??<P>
Cheers<P>

>Hi all, wonder if you can help.<BR>
>When I was 9 (I'm 25 now) I had a circumcision after the opening of the foreskin began to heal itself shut. What is this called? It wasn't that the foreskin was adhering to the glans, the opening was actually closing itself up. It made urination quite difficult, as I'm sure you can imagine; I was peeing in often 3 directions at once!<BR>
>Due to the fact that it made retraction impossible, I presume some might class it as a type of phimosis, but it's not something I've been able to find a description of in all my time of searching.<BR>
>Any info gladly received!<BR>

As an answer to: <A HREF="432.htm">questions regarding procedure and convalescence </A> written by Brad at 26 Oct 2006 19:06:01:<P>

Hello Brad,<P>
I will atempt an answer, however my site and my expertise are concerned with the  basic problematic of phimosis and its sexual consequences. Treatment is and never was my field - there are anti circ. and pro circ sites which specialise in treatment. My intention is merely to collect info on the sexual emotional and psychological consequences of phimosis when it is left untreated and ignored by the cultures medical health supervision.<P>
You seem sure that you need to be circumcised however have you read www.male-initiation.net/phimosis_treatment.html - there are a number of other cures and from your type of phimosis, stretching may be a far easier/better option for you than circumcision, or at least consider a partial circumcision, why does it have to be full?<P>
I believe for the the sort of treatment you are looking for you would be far better advised by the circumcision sites. They are experts in circumcision and seem to enjoy talking about the operation.<P>
I will try and answer.<P>
>1. is the process of seeing a GP a simple and quick one? and also do they give you a 'referral' which you can then take to where? if i want to go to a private hospital, where do i take the 'referral' to? does it go to the secretary to get booked in for, or if i want to go to public, where do i take it to for this?<P>
This totally depends on different countries - in the UK you wait for maybe 6 months in Germany you get an appointment after one week<P>
>2. under general anaesthetic, you aren't supposed to eat for 6 hours prior or drink for 1 hour prior, considering this are most operations done early in the morning when you wake up you can go straight to hospital or maybe are they later in the day? if you go private can you usually select which time it will be done at?<P>
sorry I just dont know the answers to such questions, firstly its very rare that you will receive a general anaesthetic.<P>
>3. when you get to the hospital, do they take you to the preop room and give you a robe to undress into? are there many people in the preop room? can i keep my socks on?<P>
sorry but this as well will depend on which country<P>
>4. do they usually inject the general inside the actual room they operate you in or do they inject it in another room and then wheel you into the main room when you are under aneasthetic?<P>
sorry, dont know different countries, different methods.<P>
And I simply dont know the answers - I suggest you dont worry so much and go to the doctor, he will be able to tell you the system used in your local hospital or if he does the job himself then he can inform you.<P>
heres an answer I know!<BR>
7. you can't drive after a general anaesthetic<P>
>11. the next day, how hard is it to walk? when one attempts to walk, where is the pain from, <P>
a mild irritation - it takes two weeks for convalescence<P>
>16. for someone who has had this complete phimosis, is it a longer period that it takes for the sensitivity to wear down? is it uncommon for it to go over 4 weeks?<P>
this all depends on the person and is a tricky subject - but really this a bridge to cross when you get that far after the op. with some men the sensitivity diminishes very quickly others not (or at least dont have a full circumcision   so you dont expose the entire glans to this extra sensitivity).<P>
--------------------------<BR>
>sorry for all these questions, i've read over a lot of the forums, and i know a lot can be answered from just that, <P>
sorry but I think watching chats in forums is a bad way of collecting information - look at you - you only think about circumcision, you dont seem to consider a partial circumcision to protect the glans a little from oversensitivity etc. you dont seem to know about stretching and steroids ...<P>
Please get yourself a bit more educated on possible treatments by reading www.male-initiation.net/phimosis_treatment.html<P>
>anyway, thanksa bunch guys :)<BR>
>Brad <BR>
actually there is only me answering here at present<P>
anyway Cheers<BR>

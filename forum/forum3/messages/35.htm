Hi Max,<BR>
            Thanks for your message. In actual fact it is Robin Stuart who has spent many years putting the site together and a great job he's done, I'm one of his little helpers as he is not online very often. <BR>
 <BR>
You say that your foreskin becomes very tight when you have an erection and that you are able to 'leave' the foreskin behind the glans for a couple of minutes. Frenulum breve would be likely to cause your foreskin to spring forward and cause your phallus to bend in a slightly downwards position when the foreskin is retracted. Do these symptoms seem relevant? <BR>
 <BR>
The dark colour is probably pressure on the capillaries caused by tension on the skin, I suspect you would see the same change in colour if you squeezed the head of your penis too tightly. If the foreskin does not spring forward as described it may be the case that you have a skin bridge around your frenulum which has probably been present since childhood. Whichever is the case you require medical attention, a short frenulum will require a simple operation called a frenuloplasty (see our site) and a skin bridge will require separation by a simple incision which is also performed by a surgeon. <BR>
 <BR>
I have not heard of any accounts of stretching the frenulum being successful since it is probably difficult to apply any steroid creams to that area and because of the obvious pain and risk of ripping it causes to pull the foreskin back. The other key symptom for Frenulum Breve would be a bleed, have you ever experienced bleeding? I would be concerned about your glans turning to a dark colour, this is obviously a sign that the obstruction is placing too much pressure on the glans. I suggest you avoid placing unnecessary pressure on that area for the time being.<BR>
 <BR>
If you have any more questions feel free to contact me again.<BR>
 <BR>
Regards <BR>
Nick <P>

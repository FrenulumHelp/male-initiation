As an answer to: <a href="509.htm">Re: Not so quick if I were you!</a> written by MG at 13 Jul 2007 16:58:37:<p>

Dear me!  Back in <A HREF="http://f51.parsimony.net/forum204493/messages/496.htm" TARGET=_BLANK>this post</A>, which is easy enough to find under my name in the list of <A HREF="http://f51.parsimony.net/forum204493/recent.htm" TARGET=_BLANK>recent messages</A> (at least at the time I write this, clearly after another five messages are posted, it will "drop off" that list), I specified a <A HREF="http://www.google.com/%73earch?safe=off&q=%22Phimosis+and+Tight+Foreskins%22">Google enquiry</A> which points to the relevant information source.<p>
So there you are, I've given it again!  I don't think I can give it any more specifically than that because it's a sort of etiquette or "netiquette"; those who run a forum like this one frequently do not like people being directed to others which may give a contrary opinion.<p>
And it is very much <I>not</I> a place for horror stories, unlike many others, it is a place for people who <I>want to</I>, and <I>do</I> get their problems sorted out.<p>
Now you've pretty much got the gist of it - you can fix yourself up, or you can have an operation which will foul things up, and it's going to take much the same time either way.  I'm not sure what you are saying your brother's situation is, but it seems he has - or had - no choice in the matter, so he probably <I>has</I> to be content with it, and think being circumcised is a good thing.<p>
As to your references to "general aesthetic appearance" and "Fordyce spots", it seems to me that you are <I>really</I> ignorant of what a young lady looks like in this region, and for that matter, what most guys look like.  Now I'm tempted to say - "How can this be?  Surely someone who is doing all this 'research' on the 'net must have perused the porn and <I>seen</I> real women's 'bits' and realise what they look like?"<p>
Well, of course, it doesn't work like that, does it?  It's called "air-brushing" or more simple, <I>selection</I>.  Pornography isn't about "real people" - real people look for example, like <I>you</I>!  That doesn't "sell", what "sells" is embodied in movie stars - no blemishes (at least, as long as you pick the right "camera angle" and use enough face putty).  That's what people <I>want</I> to look like and if the advertisers are lucky enough, people will pay good money for products and even cosmetic surgery - and I guess that even includes circumcision!<p>
I'm trying hard to give you a hint here!  As I pointed out in my first reply, you have a badly distorted view of reality, how people actually look at things.  If you think your appearance is that important, than by the time you hit forty or so (if that) and things aren't what they used to be, you are going to be one really sick puppy - and it won't (just) be your penis.<br>

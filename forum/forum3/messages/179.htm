Hi John,<P>
yep, get it fixed, simple.<P>
I am 53, I got my frenulum fixed ten years ago, I wish the doctors had checked it before puberty and sorted  it out then, ... I had a mixture of short frenulum and a not very tight phimotic ring, ... if theyd have been sorted out when young my life would have been completely different, (and I would never have started this website).<P>
I have regularly heard your description of the foreskin bunched up around the base of the glans. <P>
Whatever sort of frenulum you have, the doctors can operate this, its probably the simplest operation ever invented, usually takes a half hour, done as a day patient.<P>
You seem to suggest cutting this yourself. Some people have done this. The biggest problem seems to me that some frenulums are quite thick and have blood vessels running through them. When the frenulum rips, the frenular artery is often reported to loose several litres of blood, there is one medical report which says people have died from the bleeding. So, please dont do anything silly. <P>
otherwise, good luck, keep in touch,<P>
Rob.<P>

>I am 46. All my life I have had a problem with foreskin retraction. My frenulum is real tight and short. It keeps my foreskin bunched up and tight around the base of the glans when erect. It almost feels like it is restricting the erection it is so tight. I see other penises on sites like this showing the foreskin retracted back all the way like it unfolds on itself. Just wondering if this frenulum issue can be fixed by cutting it. <BR>
>Picture this, put a hose clamp on your penis and tighten it up when erect. Even when flacid the foreskin will not pull back much further. Any help would be appreciated.<BR>

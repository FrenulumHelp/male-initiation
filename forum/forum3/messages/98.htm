Hi all,<P>
I think I have been subject to ignorance throughout my life until now. You see I live in a society where this problem is still taboo, not to tell how indifferent  my parents were. <BR>
I am aged 17 and it all began when I retracted my foreskin for the very first time (which is quite unusual at that age). I thought my penis with the foreskin still on the glans when erected was something normal. Soon, I discovered the difference when I started to watch those explicit films how different was my penis with those guys.<P>
The cause for my phimosis, which I think is now partial, was that I had unusual masturbatory practices: I stroke the glans through the foreskin in the usual way, but attempt to pull the skin towards the tip of the penis instead of pulling it back toward the pubis. In this way the tubular foreskin of infancy had persisted. <P>
The still biggest mistake was that I have been forcing my foreskin behind my glans thus causing immense pain. Which I know is unwise now because of those delicate nerves and so on. But could you answer my questions.<P>
1."Do you think I must still continue stretching my foreskin in the meantime coz I found a net amelioration in the wideness of the foreskin. Could it be to a complete retraction when in erection?" <P>
2."What are the other methods of stretching the foreskin because the way I am doing is making to and fro motions when my penis is flaccid but the difficulty arises when erection begins?"<P>
3."What is the difference between partial circumcision and circumcision itself?" Is there still some of my foreskin on (i.e 1/3 gone off) because I intend to preserve almost all.<P>
My last question is: "Does the foreskin automatically pull back when a normal guy erects or vice-versa?"<P>
I think that's all and hope I have been comprehensible.<BR>
(I excuse for my English if ever it was bad) <P>
Before leaving I hope I will get the answers I am looking for? <P>
Kind Regards 

<BR>

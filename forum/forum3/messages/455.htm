Hi,<p>
Thanks so much for the reply. It's great to get an independant analysis on it. I've had a quote of £600 for frenuloplasty. I think I'm going to try and get a quote from an 'andrological surgeon' though. I think it'd be better than any random urologist.<p>
I don't mind you using the photo's, although would appreciate it if they were cropped as much as possible to remove the background.<p>
I'll pop back on again soon for an update. Thanks again,<p>
David<p>

>Hi David,<br>
>Yes its pictures 588 and 621 which show very clearly you have frenulum breve.<br>
>Now my analysis is that the frenulum is attached near the back of the glans and not so far back along the foreskin ... humm words sometimes get confusing, lets start by saying sometimes the frenulum is attached right up front by the meatus and sometimes right back at the back of the foreskin, so sometimes it covers a very long distance but is too "breve" to span the distance. You have quite literally a short frenulum it covers a short distance, ... it is also too breve, but because its almost non-existant, I suspect many urologists looking at it in the flaccid state would not recognise the erectile effects.<br>
>Humm I hope you understand me! - You have a number of options, try another urologist - or a surgeon (they are just as competent if not more than urologists (urologists specialise in internal complaints they learn nothing special about penises)) ... or even approach your local GP with the tying method <br>
>You will find the tying method (along with a number of others) on www.male-initiation.net/frenulum_treatment.html<br>
>you can see the ridge behind the glans quite clearly on 588 and 621 (and you can probably feel it tense during erection) and basicly you need the ridge cutting through or removing.<br>
>Now, sorry but I cant tell if these pictures are during erection or flaccid, please say, and please can I have permission to publish anonymously, (Ive downloaded them so you can remove them now if you want) AND please come back and tell us if you understand what Ive said ... and if after an op. the premature ejaculation etc. is fully cured.<br>
>cheers<br>

>I just wanted to get someone elses opinion on my problem. I feel like I am going mad trying to get it sorted myself and thought it would be cool if someone could let me know their opinion. I am pretty sure I need an op on my frenulum, as the glans bends down when fully retracted and causes my pc muscles to flex involuntarily. This causes premature ejaculation which I have had all my life. I went to see a urologist about it and he said he could see nothing wrong with it, but to me clearly there is.<br>

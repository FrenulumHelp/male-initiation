Welcome to new people answering,<P>
There were three new people answering on this forum last week, - sorry dont remember the names.<P>
One reminds us of releasing infant adhesions, and that we wouldnt all be here if modern medicine had taken better care of us early enough.<P>
One (please dont be over sensitive when I criticise, its not at all personal, ... ) writes "normal" ...  this is quite a common statement, usually made by people who want to proove phimosis is no problem and therefore does not need treating early.<P>
Please lets not beat about the bush with male pride and talking about foreskin problems as though they are "no problem", - here in this subject, normal means free ... with a difficult or not normal foreskin (however mild) there is a degree of functional and behavioural inhibition. I accept that effects from mild conditions, discovered in young manhood, would be nothing in an otherwise secure personality. A man with a secure personality could certainly cope with and learn from a númber of problems without them becoming a crisis ... but lets not get over confident and puffing up the male pride and start claiming its no problem.<P>
All conditions are some sort of problem, all states of "not normal" in fact mean you cant use youir full potential and you are to some extent inhibited. -  If normal is only "normal" then it is hardly worth me or anyone else considering the need to monitor kids and prevent or treat early.<P>
_________________<P>
These forums always develop around treatment (rather than psychology, early prevention etc.)<P>
I noticed someone had a list of paraphimosis cures, ... good,  In a practical sense what this forum needs is a sort of FAQ on various treatment points - how to stretch is the most common question.<P>
I can never remember all the points AND also answer an individual letter,<P>
my two online pages need summarising<BR>
www.male-initiation.net/phimosis/stretching.html<BR>
www.male-initiation.net/phimosis/stretching_lsa.html<P>
they need arranging in short sentances maybe ten easy to read points, --- it is easy work --- (I have so much else to do on the project that I never will get time for this ... I always hoped someone else would cover the practical info.)<P>
I would then put the info on line - or it can be reposted <P>
something like this<P>
1. Beauge - the theory slow  regular stretching<BR>
2  stretching against the glans<BR>
3. use heat steam showers baths<BR>
4 use steroids --- (link to 5 points on steroids)<BR>
5 use your little fingers<BR>
6. use a vibrator<P>
if anyones interested, and doesnt understand, then I will explain the idea better<P>
cheers <BR>

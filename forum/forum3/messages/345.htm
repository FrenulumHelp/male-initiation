As an answer to: <A HREF="344.htm">frenuloplasty</A> written by Robert at 04 May 2006 19:44:10:<P>

<BR>
Hello Robert,<P>
thats a nice letter, I appreciate fully your experience, and your<BR>
feelings about the urologist.<P>
As far as what happens in the operation, I presume you have read<BR>
www.male-initiation.net/frenulum_treatment.html<BR>
and maybe followed the link (very near end of page) to the medical<BR>
studies where the theory of Y plasty is explained<P>
also there is a<BR>
www.male-initiation.net/frenulum_index.html<P>
which I put online recently, (maybe since you wrote) - the index links<BR>
to Harmen's pictures of<BR>
the frenulum and its treatment ... 3 very excellant pics of a<BR>
frenuloplasty with 4 cuts - you will have to look to find them - but<BR>
thats exactly what you are looking for.<P>
Im in contact with Harmen - he recently offered that I take over his<BR>
site ...<P>
For a long time i have tried to do my site without pictures, in an<BR>
attempt to make the info available to youngsters - however there is<BR>
such a lot of useful education from pictures, that now I am collecting<BR>
pics of all the conditions - I already have several in store, but I have<BR>
nothing showing the effects of frenulum breve. Do you have a digital camera???<BR>
I need pictures ... Can you help?<P>
There ARE quite a few reports after the frenulum operation, but they<BR>
are all quite simple and happy. In contrast to complaints about the circumcision<BR>
operation - I have NEVER ever heard one complaint about the frenulum<BR>
operation, (except from one man who had laser treatment).<P>
So - I am also interested in you sharing your experience, my site was<BR>
built from men doing this - and Id be interested in pictures or anything<BR>
you wrote on the subject -<P>
How old are you? I could guess 20 yrs. - humm yes yet another link<BR>
(all links are on the frenulum index)<BR>
www.male-initiation.net/frenulum_research.html<P>
You see this is my concern, firstly, what are the sexual difficulties<BR>
you have experienced with frenulum breve (the doctors are not only<BR>
dumb when they advise circumcision, they truly are (most are) fully unaware that<BR>
the frenulum has any sexual effects!! - this subject has been tabood for<BR>
centuries). I feel firstly the medical profession must become aware of<BR>
this, and then they may want to check for the problem before puberty,<BR>
this would be a wise step, and then the problem could be treated<BR>
before puberty.<P>
So then the second point, how can they check? they only<BR>
see a boys flaccid penis .. so this is the idea behind frenulum_research,<BR>
and the questionnaire, which I would ask you to please look at, fill in and comment on.<P>
I have a friendly disagreement with Harmen whereby we both learn<BR>
something - let me interest you in this theme - his picture 4. shows<BR>
the frenulum bending the GLANS. I have a drawing of the frenulum<BR>
bending the erection, (drawn with my limited talents<BR>
from my old frenulum), on www.male-initiation.net/common_delusion.html<BR>
. My drawing shows the SHAFT bending.<P>
I reckon that his glans bends, because his frenulum is attached by the<BR>
meatus (urinary opening), mine was attached to the base of the glans,<BR>
in the "frenular delta" . Now where is yours attached and how does<BR>
your erection bend??? ... (see the questionnaire it covers this point)<P>
So, I have given you a lot to think about, a lot of links to check,<BR>
and things to read before your operation ... I think it is all<BR>
relevant to someone in your position with your attitude, ... so I hope<BR>
it isnt all work, and hope you enjoy it.<P>
Also I hope to hear from you again, but if I have made a complete<BR>
balls up, asked too much, and you decide against it, then let me at least wish a successful<BR>
operation in April.<P>
Cheers<P>
Robin<P>
>hi<BR>
>    first off, thanks for the  helpful site. im scheduled for a frenuloplasty for early April, and as is  reasonable im quite nervous. what I have noticed is an almost complete lack of  before and after pictures, and very few testimonials from people who have had  the surgery. I am interested in sharing my experience with others so that maybe  they can make a slightly more informed decision about the surgery. <BR>
> <BR>
>when I went to my urologist with my problem the  first thing he suggested was a circumcision, with the info I gathered from this  site and others I was able to tell him that I wanted an frenuloplasty instead.  im glad that I was able to do this but it scares me that he may be performing  unnecessary surgeries on people who don't know better or choose based on too  little information.<BR>
> <BR>
>I still don't feel I have a full understanding of  what is about to happen. I hope I do before the surgery, either way I would like  to help others know what to expect from my experience.<BR>
> <BR>
> <BR>
>I look forward to hearing from you<BR>

>sincerely<BR>

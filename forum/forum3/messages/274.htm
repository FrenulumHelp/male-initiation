Hi There: <P>
Firstly, let me say I think this "third way" approach<BR>
is exactly what is needed when it comes to problems of<BR>
male penile and sexual health, and I really appreciate<BR>
the work you've done developing these forums.  <P>
Even after reading so many messages and experiences of<BR>
frenuloplasty and circumcision, though, I still am<BR>
sort of stuck in terms of what to do, or whether to do<BR>
anything, about my situation.  I guess that's 'cause<BR>
everyone's willy is unique!  Also, my situation is not<BR>
as extreme as many.<P>
I'm 30 years old, and I tore my frenulum a few years<BR>
back.  This never would have happened had I not been<BR>
engaged in some really stupid sexual maneuvres with<BR>
not nearly enough lubrication, as I had never had any<BR>
indication of a thin or tight frenulum, or any<BR>
foreskin problems.  I applied some calendula salve to<BR>
it and it healed well within a month.  <P>
The thing is, my frenulum now feels tighter and<BR>
doesn't give me pleasure as it used to, especially<BR>
during oral sex.  Whereas I used to really enjoy the<BR>
sensations given by the stretching of the frenulum, I<BR>
only really notice now when my lover's teeth come into<BR>
contact, and it doesn't feel very nice - not exactly<BR>
painful, but not nice either.  The other change that I<BR>
really don't appreciate is that my foreskin, which<BR>
used to just cover the glans pretty evenly all around,<BR>
now protrudes more on the underside and looks more<BR>
flabby when flacid, owing to the way the frenulum<BR>
thickened somewhat when it healed and therefore seems<BR>
to push the foreskin foreward more on the underside in<BR>
closed position, and this means I have to pull the<BR>
foreskin back a little in order to pee straight, which<BR>
I didn't have to do before.     <P>
As for intercourse, it's fine as long as there's<BR>
enough lubrication, but I wonder if the frenulum could<BR>
tear again when I'm much older, as I understand older<BR>
women nearing menopause don't lubricate as much<BR>
naturally.  <P>
So all in all, I don't have a serious immediate<BR>
problem, but I REALLY miss the way my penis was<BR>
before.  I didn't have to be so careful not to pull<BR>
back too tightly or hard on the foreskin.  That used<BR>
to be pleasurable, whereas now the frenulum is thicker<BR>
(and I worry it could break again), and the foreskin<BR>
doesn't move quite as far back or as freely as it used<BR>
to.  <P>
I don't really want to be circumcised, although some<BR>
say that this works for frenulum problems, as little<BR>
skin is left to pull on it, which is intriguing, and<BR>
of course I'm curious as to whether it might feel<BR>
better because of that.  As for frenuloplasty, I've<BR>
read your experience that the foreskin actually gets<BR>
longer after it, and I certainly don't want that, as<BR>
my foreskin already appears longer on the underside<BR>
than it used to, but without frenuloplasty I worry<BR>
that it may tear agin in the future.  <P>
The option that I've been living with is to just try<BR>
to accept the way my body has changed and make sure<BR>
that I'm careful not to tear it again, by using plenty<BR>
of lube and generally being careful not to yank (or<BR>
have it yanked) too hard.  <P>
Thanks in advance for any advice, <P>
Lucas<P>

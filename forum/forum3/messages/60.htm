Hi ,<BR>
      No worries. I see, the fact that you have experienced a change in the tightness of your foreskin over the past couple of years is a very good sign. It shows that regular stretching whether intentionally or not can bring about benefits. I am a little concerned about your pain, is this pain experienced with the foreskin lodged behind the glans? I.e. do you retract before you get an erection? Or is the pain caused by the foreskin trying to retract over the glans but not quite making it? Either way undue pressure is being placed on a sensitive part of your anatomy. It is important that you have this sorted out as obviously this is unnecessary and can be solved. Are you not open to consider a partial circumcision which would leave you with some foreskin? Since you already have some steroid cream I would say that you have nothing to loose trying regular stretching with that. Although it is not considered a permanent option you may find that you do not need to stretch too much to experience improvement in retraction. I recommend you give it a go every day for a couple of months and see how things progress. There are not really any risks to using steroid cream although as I advised before do not force your foreskin or risk paraphimosis.<BR>
 <BR>
If it would help you to send me some photos I will be glad to take a look at them although I am quite certain from your description that you have a congenital partial phimosis which needs treatment ultimately by a partial circumcision although you may experience significant improvement if you practise regular stretching.<BR>
 <BR>
Hope this helps.<BR>

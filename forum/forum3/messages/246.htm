As an answer to: <A HREF="232.htm">Re: stretched by dad</A> written by Robin at 02 Feb 2006 19:49:40:<P>

Hi itialiano,<P>
Regardless my invitation to come into my email box - you seem to write<BR>
quite happily out in public on the forum - so buggar it - I will as<BR>
well. ....<P>
I have read other reports on this preputial kung fu - and it sounded<BR>
purely painful and traumatic - somewhere on the site I wrote how this<BR>
is counter productive to what we are wanting to achieve in an<BR>
initiation, namely a relaxed mature relationship with your own male<BR>
body.<P>
I actually consider "foreskin kung fu" far more psychologically<BR>
damaging than an infant routine circ. I can imagine after 5 yrs. of<BR>
this kung fu, that you were so frustrated by the whole process, that<BR>
you were thoroughly relieved when you were eventually cut at 13.<P>
Would you like to add anything ? - I presume it was also for you<BR>
painful and traumatic? And of course rather pointless - then as Dr.<BR>
Beauge informs us, gentle regular stretching is needed to get success.<BR>
A sort of tai chi for foreskins (hee hee)<P>
As you realise my site is not aimed at this specific problem, it is<BR>
only one of the many problems ... but all are to do with the same<BR>
taboo.<P>
If what you say about the Italian web is true, then there is no debate<BR>
on routine infant circ. pro and anti in Italy? (how amazing the<BR>
English pages are full of it). But in Italy it seems a pro - anti<BR>
preputial gym debate is in full swing. - Fascinating how different<BR>
European cultures show different effects from the general taboo, and<BR>
all are lost in their own little debates ...<P>
I already have a German translation of the welcome pages and 90% of a<BR>
French one online. - I want to be international - Id really like it to<BR>
someway branch out to Italy ...<P>
Would you like to write a page with personal memories of your story - and on a separate page an introduction to the situation and links to Italian webspace. I really believe any objective report on these subjects would fit on my site, ....it all fits under the heading of taboos on phimosis ... and I<BR>
could easily publish it...<P>
And then it is perhaps rather adventurous but if you translate my<BR>
welcome page, (give it an hour try! maybe you will enjoy it, I enjoy<BR>
translating) ... (and if you wanted, I could also collect all my passages<BR>
relating to preputial kung fu - tai chi and you could translate them<BR>
as well...)<P>
And then we could put your address as contact address OR we could open<BR>
an Italian forum, and you could put your pages up there as well, ... and maybe ... in about 6 months maybe ... someone could reply, and so then YOU would then be in a position to start communicating with other men who have been through your experience and could start generally having your say and changing the attitudes to foreskin gym in Italy.<P>
It is all possible ... but it would require a bit of work and general<BR>
interest from you ... I dont want to force or pressurise anyone into<BR>
anything.<P>
Im just explaining my idea - Its up to you if you want to follow it<BR>
....<P>
think thats all for now<P>
Cheers<P>
Robin

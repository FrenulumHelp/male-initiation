As an answer to: <A HREF="120.htm">Doubts on diagnosis</A> written by Irwan at 20 Oct 2005 18:19:16:<P>

Dear Irwan,<P>
One problem for me is the new laser techniques - in that I havent<BR>
heard any results from these. But I am amazed how very modern they are<BR>
in Greece!!<P>
The partial circumcision went well then, and approx half the foreskin<BR>
you used to have is to be expected, so that in the flaccid state there<BR>
is no overhang, but the foreskin covers the glans.<P>
Ive never heard of any regeneration of the frenulum tissue - maybe<BR>
this can occur when the frenulum is lasered ..? I doubt it, but I cant<BR>
answer this<P>
Then I quote you - first "I can also feel the area where the frenulum<BR>
was a bit hard, and it also looks white (just like the frenulum used<BR>
to look). Does that mean there is more frenulum there that needs to be<BR>
removed?"<P>
After a normal frenuloplasty there is also the white coloured "root"<BR>
of the frenulum - if this white colour is truly the root, or if it is<BR>
simply scar tissue is irrelevant, this doesnt need removing.<P>
If its scar tissue then it may be rather hard for the first few<BR>
months, this will decrease but there will probably always be some<BR>
stiff tissue there.<P>
"And here is the question : should my foreskin now unfold completely?"<P>
I feel you are expecting it to fold back evenly like the cuff on a<BR>
shirt , and this doesnt happen.<P>
To explain better we must first look at the next quote. It really<BR>
confused me, I could see you had made an effort to express yourself<BR>
clearly, but Im afraid I could only understand it if you were standing<BR>
on your head :) aha I thought so maybe your descriptions are when you<BR>
are standing and holding your penis up to look at it - either that or<BR>
you have erection like one of those Greek Gods - Pan and the satyrs,<BR>
where it curves upwards :)<P>
" ... the way I see it there is still no elasticity on the front part<BR>
where the frenulum used to be (or is still there partly) so the front<BR>
part of the foreskin cannot move down as much as the back part,"<P>
so the front part where the fren. used to be, means the underneath (for<BR>
one of us with normal human erections and penis which hang) - and the<BR>
back part is what is normally the top part (but in your Godly stance<BR>
this shows to your belly button ...) Ok I got it - so lets put it in<BR>
my language and I hope this helps.<P>
Underneath (where the frenulum was) the foreskin is always nearer the<BR>
glans and a normal foreskin slants backwards (towards you) on the top<BR>
side when pulled back - If you look and check the shape of your glans<BR>
then I think you will find .. well with me the glans underneath to the<BR>
meatus (the urinary opening) is aroung 2 thirds the length of the<BR>
glans on top, ie. the glans isnt evenly round. So, the foreskin now<BR>
fits neatly.<P>
I think everything is Ok and how we can expect it to be. If you send<BR>
me pics I might be able to say more.<P>
If you really really want a foreskin which folds back evenly then this<BR>
will require plastic surgery, a cosmetic surgeon, and Im not sure if<BR>
it would work anyway, ... but there must be a way if youve got the<BR>
money.<P>
The important question for me is do you suffer ANY pain or discomfort<BR>
during masturbation? would you have any problems with love making or<BR>
using condoms?<P>
cheers<P>
Robin<P>
PS. Hey and I notice youre from Greece - one could imagine you speak<BR>
Greek as fluently as English ... I have a question: the word "phimos"<BR>
comes from ancient Greek meaning a horses muzzle - is there any modern<BR>
Greek word related to this?<P>
Any uneasy personal sexual experience or development which would add<BR>
to the evidence supporting monitoring boys before puberty - would be<BR>
appreciated - anonymity guaranteed -<P>
please note I am only online once a week (usually on Wednesdays).  I<BR>
collect mail one week and answer the next, thoughtful replies can take<BR>
2 week delay.

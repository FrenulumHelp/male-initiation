As an answer to: <A HREF="14.htm">treatment - phimosis</A> written by RS at 11 Jan 2005 17:11:36:<P>

Hi,<P>
I now get time to answer your amusing letter<BR>
"The Trials and Tribulations of a Stretcher"<P>
Very interesting for me is the description of how the white ring turned red, - Ive heard this before, but never had an explanation why.<P>
Youve obviously got a secondary ring, and are set to do a life long battle against it - I wonder if such heroism is awaited in the modern world - Perserverance is certainly a good quality, but in the face of the mongolian hoardes little Peter with his sword dont stand much chance. -- I think Id go for a partial circ. - or someone was suggesting a pediatric urologist would do minimal plastic surgery on just the ring area. As youre in the UK I know Dr. Cuckow in London does plastic surgery. (costs about 2000 quid I imagine these days). <BR>
Still, dont let me silence your battle cries, if you want further info. call back here <P>
thanks and all the best<BR>
Robin<P>

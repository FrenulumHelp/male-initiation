i want just best for my son. I read that the best age for cut is 10-13, i would cut him hight and tight like me, i know that this is best for him but he is just little scared. My wife is absolut agree, she think cut is better. I will cut him this spring, but before i would like explain him the benefits circumcision<P>

>>after many years of suffering from tight frenulum I breached it during sex, so last year i finally got circumcised. The difference has been amazing. Apart from removing the obvious physical problems I feel that circumcision has given my penis a new, manly look.<BR>
>>>>>>>>>> Scoop<BR>
> I know  of  a  lad   who  is  like  your  12  yr  old  son  and   while  he   too had  or should  say  did  have  a   rather  tight  foreskin  he  was  quite  happy  with  what  he   had.  he  was  in  the  scouts   and  on  the    swim  team  and  was  in so  many  way  a  normal  happy  12  yr  old  .  Well  his  dad  was  killed  in an  auto  accident  and  his  mother was  not  happy  with  the  father    idea  of  leaving  the  child  intact.  soon  After   the  mother  took  upon herself  to  have  the  child   circumcised    against  his  will.  He  now  has  quit   going  to  scouts     has    quit  the  swim  team  and   has  resorted  to   sitting   all  the  time  to  void.  it  has   truly   ruined  this  child   for  life .  <BR>
><<<<<<< Father<BR>
> My son who is 12 has a foreskin which is a little tight and I would like to have him circumcised too. But he won't agree, he can pull back his foreskin however and all his friends are uncut. And I would like how can i persuade him to get cut like his dad? <BR>
>>>>>>>>>Scoop <BR>
> Your son   is  in  NO  HARM    your  son  is happy  with  his  body  and  seems   to  have  no  problems   associated  with  his  foreskin .  I  would  ask  you  to  forgive  him  and  let  him  choose   how   he  wants  to  live with  what  he  has  now.  Your  happy  with  what  you   done    he  is   happy  with  what  he  has  and  like  you  said  his  peers  are  all   like  him  uncut  Natural  and  intact please  dont   put  any  added  pressure on  your son  my  doing  something    he  does  not  want  done  .  Love  your  son   and  leave  his    body  to  him  to   choose   what  HE  wants   done  to  it  please   Scoop  <BR>

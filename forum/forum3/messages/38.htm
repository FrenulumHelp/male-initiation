Hi RC,<P>
This is a tricky question ... I guess you have an infection probably LSA, <P>
I have heard of this symptom of eg. 8 small tears or cuts on the foreskin - Im sorry I cant remember exactly the context, but I believe it was LSA (also called BXO)<P>
To diagnose LSA: "The glans demonstrated sclerogenous ivory colored patches located perimeatally, which is the classic manifestation that determines diagnosis." (Meuli)<P>
I have several questions, first which country are you in, is it easy to see specialists or not? .. have you money to pay to see specialists? ... you need a dermatologist (skin specialist)<P>
the warm salt water and medicine indicate to me that your doctor has diagnosed an infection, but what? - I havent heard of MUPIROCIN - I have read 2 studies on clobetasol propiate one showed that it cured LSA the other showed that it didnt - so we are dealing with recent medical studies and really there is nothing which is 100% reliable.<P>
circumcision is the recommended treatment, - the reason for this is that is allows the glans to dry out -- its like the jungle in there (hot and sticky) underneath your foreskin - its the perfect breeding place for infections, so the area has to be opened up and kept clean, - you could start doing this simply by keeping the foreskin retracted when flaccid - (its quite easy to do this, but maybe you need a bit of elastoplast to help keep it back) and then it depends on your attitude to experiments - if you want to try a partial circumcision, and then wear the foreskin retracted, then this could very possibly be a solution.<P>
One man on my site claimed that homeopathy cured his LSA <P>
anyway, if it is LSA, (get the diagnosis right first) then I suggest you do a search on my site and the net in general for any latest advice <P>
and I will be back here again more than likely next Wednesday.<P>
Cheers<P>

>For the past several months I have been experiencing a problem that has only gotten worse as time progresses. My experience as an uncircumcised male is that after intercourse, the next day I would find my penis to be in pain. The pain and swelling would subside in a few days. However now I find that my foreskin has become extremely tight. I have trouble retracting whether I'm flaccid or erect. It has become so painful when I'm erect that I have not been able to have intercourse for a couple of months. The head of my penis would be red and sore but eventually subside, but the tightness becomes progressivley worse. I went to see a doctor about it and I could hardly retract at all. He told me to soak my penis in warm salt water and prescribed a "MUPIROCIN" ointment. This creme would make the redness go away and I would be able to retract when flaccid. However when I'm erect my foreskin no longer retracts on its own. If i retract it myself it becomes very painful. I tried to have intercourse and I saw stars. The worse thing is that I notice small tears or cuts at the end of my foreskin. Sometimes its 1 or 2 . Sometimes its like 8 small cuts. Someone please help. The doctor told me I would have to be circumcied. I really don't want it to be done. Has anyone on this site experience what I'm talking about. Please reply because I need help. <BR>

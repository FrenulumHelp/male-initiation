Hello<P>
I don't normally do this, but after tonight's little foray through the<BR>
internet, and having found your site, I felt I really had to give something<BR>
back, so feel free to put this one up online if you like.<P>
I'll keep it brief. I'm from Ireland. I'm 22. As near as I can tell,<BR>
circumcision is an extreme rarity over here. I was never one to go gawking<BR>
at other people's genitals, and I'm not a great sports person anyway, so I<BR>
can't personally confirm this, but I'm pretty sure that no one I knew was<BR>
circumcised. Stating the obvious, I'm also uncircumcised.<P>
For a great many years, as far as I knew, circumcision was confined to<BR>
jewish rituals. I always thought of it as a very, very fringe practice. The<BR>
wince inducing thought of walking around 'all day' with the "inside" of your<BR>
penis exposed. It didn't not seem like a good idea. It was only about six<BR>
months ago that I discovered that over half of americans are still<BR>
circumcised! And I've been on the internet for a long time! I can tell you<BR>
it was quite a shock. I found for quite a while that I couldn't really look<BR>
at americans in the same way. I had NO idea. In any case, I disapporve of<BR>
the operation on the simple basis that people should not undergo surgury of<BR>
any kind unless it is absolutely necessary. But I digress.<P>
Now, as I've said, I've been on the internet for a while, and on occassion I<BR>
do delve into the odd pornographic movie. As you can imagine, most of the<BR>
pornography on the internet comes from America. I think you can tell where<BR>
this is going.<P>
Now, I'm rather a dense sort of person, so for some reason, it never really<BR>
clicked with me that in all the videos I was seeing, the male actors were in<BR>
fact all circumcised. The thought never even occurred to me. As I say, I'm<BR>
rather dense. Anyway, this very evening, I was once again perusing the less<BR>
reputable parts of the internet, when a rather different video came into my<BR>
posession.<P>
Now, having been made aware of the whole circumcision things months before,<BR>
I was quickly aware that the male actor in the video was uncircumcised.<BR>
However, when his female partner began to manipulate his penis, I was<BR>
incredibly surprised to see his foreskin rolling "all" the way back down!<P>
My own foreskin can roll "all" the way back, as seen from the top, when my<BR>
penis is flaccid. But when erect, my foreskin will clear the glans, exposing<BR>
all of it, but will bunch just below there, rather like a jumper sleve when<BR>
you bunch it up your arm. It always takes a little pulling to get it doen<BR>
that far, and it has a tendency to roll back up. There will be some tension<BR>
at this point. I had never assumed that this was anything other than<BR>
completely normal, in fact I had never assumed anything about it at all, so<BR>
needless to say this paticular illicit video before me came as quite a<BR>
shock!<P>
A little googling turned up your site and the concept of a frenulum breve. I<BR>
don't think mine is short enough to qualify for treatment, but it was a bit<BR>
of an expierience to find out I've had half a medical condition for all<BR>
these years. I haven't had intimate relations with anyone yet, so I suppose<BR>
this was good to find out "before" an awkward moment. Masturbation for me is<BR>
largely a "foreskin on" expierience. In fact, I haven't even practiced with<BR>
a condom, the instructions on which always seemed a little idosyncratic to<BR>
me. "Roll back foreskin". 'Why? It'll only roll forward again?' I suppose I<BR>
should really get around to that.<P>
Anyway, I'd like to thank you for your site and the information in it. I<BR>
finally "get" what all those photo's of uncircumcised penises were showing.<BR>
The site was of great help to me as I was rather bereft of any other<BR>
sources. Googling "foreskin" has a way of bringing up homosexual pornogaphy<BR>
links, which, while they may provide possibly the most complete<BR>
demonstartions of foreskin anatomy, are rather unliekly to provide it in<BR>
a... succinct way.<P>
Thanks for the site.<P>
Yours,<BR>
A very cowardly<P>

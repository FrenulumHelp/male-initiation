>Hi. My 18 month old son is going to have a skin bridge removed from his penis. I have noticed this from day one after his circumscion. His dr kept saying it was a adhesion and it will go away on its own. Well i took him to a specialists and now he has to have surgery in 2 weeks. I was wondering why this happen? Also can it come back? Did i do something wrong? He also has a lot of skin left on the penis. I have to pull it down and clean it. Is this normal? Both doctors said it is because he was chunky. Thanks and i hope you have some answers for me.<BR>

Hi leslie its nothing you did wrong I too noticed this on my sons penis from the moment after his circumscion, my peditrician also said its normal and will become thinner as he grows and dissapear. Guess what your first instinst is right my son now 16 had the surgery last year to correct this problem, after an emergency appendectomy his surgeon called me and told me he noticed this skin bridge on my sons penis, when he said it I knew right away what he was talking about. I hadnt really examined my sons penis since around the time he started showering himself like 7 or eight<BR>
I told my son that he needed to have something fixed and that even though he did have to go back under general anestihia the doc said he would be much happier... The surgery was done and the surgeon said at least 2 and half inces was released immediatly<BR>
He healed fine and is now a normal active 16 year old. The surgeon said it was a botched circumscion and I believe it was.... all is well now but they bull shit us new mothers and when you believe what your doc says you trust them....<BR>
DONT mothers should trust their instints and get a second opinion from a female doctor... email me well chat...

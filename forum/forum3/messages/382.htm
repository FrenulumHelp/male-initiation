As an answer to: <A HREF="257.htm">my son  won't agree to circ</A> written by frallog at 22 Feb 2006 02:06:01:<P>

>after many years of suffering from tight frenulum I breached it during sex, so last year i finally got circumcised. The difference has been amazing. Apart from removing the obvious physical problems I feel that circumcision has given my penis a new, manly look. My son who is 12 has a foreskin which is a little tight and I would like to have him circumcised too. But he won't agree, he can pull back his foreskin however and all his friends are uncut. and I would like how can i persuade him to get cut like his dad? <P>
If your son won't agree perhaps its best to leave him alone. If at a later age it causes him problems he can explore various other ways of sorting it out and as a last resort but only as a last resort opt for circumcision but when he wants it. As regards the loks of the penis, I cannot understand why people are so concerned as even after getting it circumcised I do not like the looks of my penis and would have preferred to have it intact if I had the choice. Like your son most of my friends are uncut and have teased me about my cut status but being a muslim circumcision is not left to choice or preference but rather obligatory for males. Please don't impose it on your son.<BR>

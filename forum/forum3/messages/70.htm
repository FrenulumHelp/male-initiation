Hi again,<BR>
             <BR>
 The term phimosis appears to have different meanings dependent upon who you ask or where you research. Our site does indicate that phimosis is a generalised term meaning non-retractability, I had actually forgotten this. However the infant conditions which are included in this generalised definition often do not extend beyond childhood. If this term was used to indicate any form of non-retractability then you are right that most infants would be born with phimosis. In my opinion this is not the case and if this view were widespread then Phimosis would be seen as an entirely natural phenomena. Quite clearly phimosis is only diagnosed once it causes an individual problems and I suggest that infant non-retractability is natural and often does not cause any problems. Phimosis on the other hand needs treatment and infant non-retractability often does not. In my mind that is the difference.<BR>
 <BR>
Therefore in nearly all cases of non-retractability in adults the cause is a phimotic ring. I also take issue with the generalised use of the term 'phimosis' since Frenulum breve can also cause non-retractability and in my mind Frenulum Breve is different to a phimosis although admittedly these conditions are often present together.<BR>
 <BR>
 I'm not really sure what the significance of this topic is for you but I hope you now have clear in your mind your own understanding of phimosis and the related conditions.<BR>
 <BR>
I have not heard of any research which suggests that a phimotic ring is made up of cysts.<BR>
 <BR>
I imagine that obtaining skin from a phimotic ring to perform analysis would be difficult although I would be interested to hear what this may discover about the nature of a phimotic ring.<BR>
 <BR>
Picture 4 looks like a very short frenulum. Does your penis bend forwards in that way when you are erect. It is difficult to ascertain whether you retracted erections are causing you pain because you are placing pressure on your penis from the tight foreskin or whether you have a short frenulum. The fact that your glans are always covered prevents accurate diagnosis. See http://www.male-initiation.net/frenulum_breve.html#start to give yourself a better idea of the symptoms. This springing forward is not natural, a normal foreskin should quite happily remain retracted until its owner returns it to the forward position. You may discover that once stretching has improved your phimosis, a new problem presents itself in the form of a short frenulum. If this is the case you will require minor surgery, a frenuloplasty to be precise.<BR>
 <BR>
You should not bruise your glans when stretching because you are only supposed to retract as far as is comfortable and not exert any undue pressure on your penis. Surely your penis is put under more pressure during intercourse that whilst gently stretching your foreskin. I sense a reluctance to even touch your penis?<BR>
 <BR>
As to the research carried out on children using a balloon catheter. I have no idea how safe this technique is to use yourself and I am certain it is not a common practise. As far as I am aware the most common and successful practise for stretching is by hand with steroid cream.<BR>
 <BR>
I hope this helps.<BR>

Hello nick,<P>
My name is w and i hope you can anwser some questions concerning my husband. 8 years ago he had an operation for a uretha stricture it was called a turp operation and he has to use a self cathater 3 times week for life. he is 40 years old and healthy a non smoker and not over weight so an operation at 32 was a shock to him because the doctor said it was more common in older age. For the past year he had what he thought was thrush and was treated with several types of canastan cream also he had antibotics for NSU which he was treated for and given different antibiotics for about 10 months but still had no change,he was sent for a tomogram scan of his bladder and kidneys but the results were clear.He has since seen his uroligst who has said he needs to be circumsised. The problem he has is when we have sex the skin just under the penis gland at each side cracks and bleeds he has plenty of foreskin but i have read about a condition called frenulum breve. His symptoms seem to match this more than phimosis, he has no discharge and his penis looks fine apart from some shiney redness at the bass of the gland and the phimotic ring. The v shaped piece of skin does seem to look a bit tight but the rest of the skin in that area looks like it is thin. I hope you can help with any advice because i hope there could be another anwser to help instead of him being circumsised.  thank you and i look forward to hearing from you.

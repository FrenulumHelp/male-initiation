As an answer to: <A HREF="302.htm">Frenulum Breve-ish</A> written by very Private Person at 30 Mar 2006 20:20:42:<P>

<BR>
Hello Mr P, Person,<P>
Thank you, very entertaining, thoroughly enjoyed reading the letter.<P>
I realise many of your comments are Irish humour, but will say that<BR>
most of us are completely dense when it comes to this subject, we get<BR>
used to our bodies as they are with no sense that something could be<BR>
restricted and different to what other men can do.<P>
I will tell you the tale of when I tried a condom and it sprang 6 feet<BR>
across the room. I had a mixture of frenulum breve and a mild phimotic<BR>
ring, so I could just about retract the foreskin to the same position<BR>
as you, but then the phimotic ring would latch over the ridge of the<BR>
glans, forming a sort of trigger mechanism which promtly fired, boing<BR>
! and the condom was in orbit :)<P>
You obviously react very well under shock, I could learn from you. I<BR>
suppose I dont want to shock you out of your museful approach to the<BR>
whole thing ... Ahem ... but I think you realise there is a potential<BR>
awkward moment in your future ...<P>
I suggest that actually once you mastered the art of putting on a<BR>
condom with your condition, this would hold the skin forward in a way<BR>
with which you could probably avoid direct problems with penetration<BR>
and intercourse. And with felatio or in someone elses hands, you could<BR>
ask them simply not to pull the foreskin back past this feeling of<BR>
tension ... however at some point ... most likely when you want to<BR>
penetrate without a condom, then either the frenulum will rip, or it<BR>
will be sore for a day or two afterwards ... or a number of rarer<BR>
possibilities.<P>
If you answered a few questions on what sort of frenulum breve you<BR>
have - I could probably predict whats most likely to happen.<P>
And Im looking for volunteers ... I put up an update on the frenulum<BR>
pages since you wrote ... check out please<BR>
www.male-initiation.net/frenulum_index.html you will see among others<BR>
the "frenulum praeputii assessment questionnaire" ... I will simply<BR>
ask you to fill it out.<P>
Now to get to the point, I disagree with you, I think you need<BR>
treatment. But Id like to hook up to your sense of calm and suggest a<BR>
few things which at first might seem a little complex, but I assure<BR>
you Im looking for simple solutions ...<P>
First then, the simple thing to tell you, is sometime you need a<BR>
frenuloplasty and professional treatment from a doctor (a surgeon at<BR>
best simply because they are more used to cutting than the<BR>
Urologists).<P>
however ... the simple solution might actualy lie elsewhere ...<P>
The first possibility is that the frenulum might stretch. I have no<BR>
bona fida reports that it has ever worked ... but it is theoretically<BR>
possible, because skin stretches, ... we would need a two week<BR>
experiment with at least 10 mins a day to find out if this could work<BR>
for you ... we would need to plan it, you would need to fill out the<BR>
questionnaire to do it scientifically . I will post a few extra<BR>
practical notes on stretching at the end of letter.<P>
So generally, you are being invited to become a test<BR>
animal, a guinea pig for a crazy experiment ... I mean dont<BR>
listen to me Im just a nutcase on Internet, ... I mean go to a doc let<BR>
him frenoplasty you ... dont listen to crazy online loonies like me<BR>
...<P>
I wonder if a museful Irishman can be motivated to get experimental<BR>
... we will see<P>
Anyway thats all - Cheers and thanks a bundle for the laughs.<P>
Robin<P>

a few notes on Stretching the Frenulum<P>
Testing this would only be intelligent for someone with a mild degree<BR>
of brevity, no blood vessels running through it, and a frenulum which<BR>
was not hemmed or topped with a string.<P>
steroids would thin the frenulum skin to help stretching<P>
The only validated reports I have heard are that stretching the<BR>
frenulum always rips it. However this could be explained with the idea<BR>
that it is a sudden stretch which causes ripping. A gentle regular<BR>
stretching is necessary.<P>
(Maybe pulling suddenly could be used to initiate a controlled rip?)<P>
The more often and the more gentle you are the more effect this has<BR>
when stretching skin. Repeatedly rhymically tensing and flexing is<BR>
more effective than holding a stretch under tension.<P>
The main problem as I see it is stretching/putting the frenulum under<BR>
tension is painful - so can you discover a way to stretch without<BR>
pain?, maybe even with a little pleasure ...<P>
----------------------------------------------------------------<P>
a few notes on What to do if the frenulum rips.<P>
When the frenulum rips be happy, this is soon the end of your problems.<P>
There are two considerations: 1. the bleeding 2. the frenulum mending shorter than before.<P>
1. The first worry may be the bleeding. There is a frenular artery down there and sometimes it runs through the frenulum. Mostly there will be a little bleeding, but usually of no worry. In exceptional cases bleeding can be profuse enough to make someone lose consciousness. <P>
Lets prepare for this exceptional case : Do you have swabs, and absorbent wads of lint - tampons are an alternative, bundles of cotton wool, anything absorbent .... and before you faint you need to have considered phoning an ambulance and in an emergency clamping the frenular artery with a paper clamp or even a clothes peg.<P>
-----------<P>
2. Men complain that after a rip the frenulum often mends even shorter than before.<P>
The mistake they make is to let the frenulum heal with the foreskin forward, leaving the frenulum to join in its old position, but with a scar which makes it even tighter. What you must do - (if possible at the same time as stopping the bleeding) - is let the frenulum heal with the foreskin backwards, in the new ripped position. The wound must heal lengthways.  <P>
This is where you need Kerlex (elastic bandage). The wound must have antiseptic cream, wad of absorbent lint, and a kerlex bandage round the shaft holding the wad in place and foreskin back.  <BR>

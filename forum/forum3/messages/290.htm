As an answer to: <A HREF="289.htm">phimosis</A> written by Jim at 09 Mar 2006 19:54:38:<P>

<P>
Hello Jim,<P>
Thanks for the letter - I am a bit dense when it comes to new<BR>
technology and so I raised an eyebrow when I noticed you had stuck a<BR>
picture in the middle of your email ... probably quiite normal but<BR>
quite outside my technological intelligence ... and then when I<BR>
decoded it I was even more suprised when I saw my old drawing of my<BR>
old foreskin staring back at me !!<P>
Now, I must say that I decoded this picture on my internet access<BR>
computer, and on my comp. at home I cant decode it, so please send any<BR>
pics as attachments in future.<P>
Thank you for your kindly excuses for not understanding phimosis from<BR>
my pages, but quite simply, there is a lot of subject matter to<BR>
organise, an I aint done it yet ... I do consider that my site is indeed the<BR>
first manual on phimosis ... and I think this is true, Ive never seen<BR>
anything else similar ...<P>
You say it wasnt a problem for 20 yrs. - I guess then you must be<BR>
around 35 yrs. old? - surely it led to masturbation with the foreskin<BR>
forward? and I imagine intercourse was painful or problematic? - Id be<BR>
interested ...<P>
Your phimotic ring is a bit tighter than mine was. I could scrape mine<BR>
over the glans when fully erect. Yours sounds as though if you did<BR>
acheive this you would have trouble getting it back over infront of<BR>
the glans, causing paraphimosis, so we dont want that.<P>
maybe you need to check a short file<BR>
www.male-initiation.net/paraphimosis.html<P>
Phimosis is such a general word, comprising anything which hinders<BR>
retraction, part of your phimosis was caused by the short frenulum,<BR>
but now you have a phimotic ring. Obviously it is hardly visible when<BR>
flaccid (non-erect) because otherwise the doctor would have seen it<BR>
and probably advised circumcision instead of just frenuloplasty ...<BR>
still be happy, you now have other option on treatment.<P>
You show no signs of BXÖ or any infection, it seems you have simply a<BR>
normal white phimotic ring. The first option for treatment is<BR>
stretching - you have the ring since birth it is pretty certainly a<BR>
primary phimotic ring, (not secondary to an infection etc.) and<BR>
therefore it should stretch, a simple procedure, needing no doctor,<BR>
and you will need a two week test period to see if it works, (and<BR>
then if not we think again) -- so please see<BR>
www.male-initiation.net/stretching.html<P>
Digital pictures would be very good - For a long time i have tried to<BR>
do the site without pictures, in an attempt to make the info available<BR>
to youngsters - however there is such a lot of useful education from<BR>
pictures, that now I am collecting pics of all the conditions - I<BR>
already have several, but nothing showing the "hour glass" effect of<BR>
our degree of phimotic ring, as in my drawing and in your penis, so I<BR>
would appreciate ANY pics. - (and Im not gay, and pics are for me<BR>
purely cold interest).<P>
My last word, is try the stretching, if its not working in 2 weeks<BR>
then we have to think further - (you should notice some effect within<BR>
a few days)<P>
good luck<P>

>Hi Robin, how are you? First i must say the site on phimosi is very helpful  and I am sure that many people have benefited from your work. I however seem to  of got completely lost in the understanding of all the possibilies of phimosis,  I understand this is due to the fact that no two people are the same and there  is no manual for the human body. I was wondering if we could correspond over  e-Mail for a while to see if you could help me further with dificulties.<BR>
>From what i can gather, I have phimosis, for as long as i can remember I  have not been able to retrct my foreskin, for 20 years this was not a problem  becuase I didn't know i should be able to. About a year ago I went to the doctor  about it and we both decided that it was my frenulm, I had a operation to cut  the frenulm which helped a small amount. I can now retract my foreskin fully  when not erect, yet when erect, I cannot. Depending on how erectmy penis is, I  can retract the foreskin almost fully when I am just over semi erect, however i  would not want to ejaculate with it retrcted as it feels a little to tight. The  main problem is that when fully erect, I can uncomfortably retyract the foreskin  over the head of my penis, but no further, if I continually try I start to loose  my erection and then it starts to retract as I said before. The picture below  highly resmebles my situation, <BR>
>I have read many things about BXO, and "white phimotic rings", from what i  can tell my phimotic ring is of a differnet colour to the rest the surrounding  area, however I am not at all confident with a self diagnosis and would like to  refrain from seeing the doctor again. Also, while flacid the foreskin does seem  a little to long when compared with other pictures on the internet, this  includes falcid and erect, the foreskin when erect is nearly closed around the  head of the penis, but as I say does allow slight retraction, but not  enough.<BR>
> <BR>
>I would be grateful of any feedback you could send me, and if your were  comfortable with it, I would be okay with sending you digital pictures of my  situation, (please do not take that the wrong way, and only as a suggestoin),  Thankyou for time and I will look forward to hearing from you, Jim.<BR>

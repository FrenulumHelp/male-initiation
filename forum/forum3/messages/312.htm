As an answer to: <A HREF="308.htm">update + details.. need help please</A> written by Nero (again) at 06 Apr 2006 03:25:46:<P>

Hi Nero,<P>
No problem reading the whole story ... far better than the first little note where I understood almost nothing :-(<P>
First then, the hyper sensitivity of the glans is very normal if the glans has never been exposed before - this will usually wear off in a short time.<P>
You were never aware that the foreskin is meant to retract over the penis head (the glans) yes well they miss this out in the sexual education ...<P>
You say no problems masturbating, except of course that you dont retract your foreskin, so even though you are used to it and happy, actually you are a little inhibited when compared with the normal man. A Dr. Beauge explained the different methods of masturbation used by men with foreskin problems, one of his methods was by rubbing against the bedclothes without actually touching the penis ... yeah sure its still good fun, but it could be even better!<P>
Ok so the important points are that you are describing paraphimosis, when the foreskin and the phimotic ring sticks behind the glans and doesnt come forward again please read <A HREF="../../../paraphimosis.html">male-initiation.net/paraphimosis.html</A><P>
It actually seems to me incredible that they left it to simply happen again and only told you to "pull the foreskin back over the head of the penis after cleaning and urination." I feel they should have at least advised some practical stretching exercises - so please see<BR>
<A HREF="http://male-initiation.net/stretching.html">male-initiation.net/stretching.html</A><P>
Now, to add to the confusion (sorry) but Im not sure if part of the pain might be a frenulum breve ... a simple question, when the foreskin is ratracted (even in the flaccid state) do you have a tight bit of skin under the glans which pulls the glans downwards?<P>
So, all together, I believe that a few simple stretching exercises will stretch the phimotic ring in a matter of weeks ... so that it moves freely and without problems.<P>
so, keep in touch and tell us how it develops.<P>
good luck<P>
Robin<P>

><B>Note</B>: the main problem is summarized in "Problem 3" if you do not wish the read the whole story. Many thanks for taking your time.<BR>
>Ok here is the whole story. First of all, i'm 16 uncircumsized. I was never aware the foreskin is supposed to be able to retract over the head of the penis. <BR>
><u>Problem 1</u>: I can only get it partially over the head of the penis while flaccid and havnt tried erect<BR>
>Life is good - no problems masturbating or urinating or even spending time with my girlfriend. My girlfriend and i actually do this thing where we like rub our bodies against eachother through my clothing so obviously this made me erect. the foreksin always stayed over the head of my penis then too.<BR>
><u>Problem 2</u>: one time we were rubbing against eachother and i felt a pain. I later discovered the skin had been retracted half way over the head of the penis, back towards the shaft, exposing my very sensitive head. I tried pulling it forward but the skin just pulled back, leaving part of it exposed.<BR>
>I basically slept on it and my penis went back to normal but it happened a couple times again.<BR>
>one of those times the foreskin was pulled ALL the way back past the head of the penis towards the shaft. I panicked and went to the hospital not knowing wtf was going on. After a very painful doing-whatever-they-did to my penis, it was back to normal. They said it was Phimosis and told me to "pull the foreskin back over the head of the penis after cleaning and urination."<BR>
>I had no idea what they were talking about so i did research, coming here. <BR>
><u>Problem 3</u>: The same problem continues - when i'm with my girlfriend, any sort of rubbing against my pants causes the foreskin to be pulled back towards the shaft. Everytime i try to pull it back over the head, it retracts on its own - exposing the head of my penis (which hurts when my pants touch it because of its sensitivity).<BR>

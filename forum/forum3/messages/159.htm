As an answer to: <A HREF="155.htm">Frenulum breve</A> written by Jim at 20 Nov 2005 17:38:38:<P>

Hi Jim,<P>
yes this is the sort of thing Im talking about. <P>
> However, when I'm erect, the frenulum itself, where it's attached to the glans, turns white as the blood is forced out of it by the tension, and the feeling can be uncomfortable or actually painful.  Is this the sort of thing you're talking about?  <P>
And perhaps its important to remember that during masturbation - when everything is manually controlled then you can fiddle around with yourself and avoid any impending pain, but during intercourse ("look no hands" free flight) then the foreskin will pull back and forth pretty relentlessly in the heat of the moment, and this might take a bit of fun out of the game. If pulled on suddenly it might even rip and start bleeding. <P>
Its this sort of all suprises and self experiment modern male initiation which my sites all about - I wish theyd have checked me before puberty - (but then I guess Id have nothing to write an internet site about) - how old are you? are you from the homeland (UK) - answer if you want advice on treatment -  <P>
As you found your way here, I guess you can be trusted to find your way back and check out the frenulum treatment pages on my site (go to the pretty picture of the map, top of this page - middle left is frenulum treatment) - I would suggest you read that and then come back with a few more questions next week.<P>
cheers<P>

>I found your website on frenulum breve and I wonder if this is what I have.  Most men don't ever get the chance to compare erect willies, so it's difficult to decide when yours is different from what you're supposed to have.  My foreskin is quite long, and will easily cover my glans while erect.  I can also pull it back when flaccid or erect and it will sit behind the glans except for where the frenulum is.  However, when I'm erect, the frenulum itself, where it's attached to the glans, turns white as the blood is forced out of it by the tension, and the feeling can be uncomfortable or actually painful.  Is this the sort of thing you're talking about?  <BR>

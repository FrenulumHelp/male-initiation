Rob,<P>
Thanks very much for the answer! I've had several medical students baffled with my descriptions.<BR>
As for the feelings, the only thing really coming to mind is a fear I felt when I saw it was obviously getting worse, and it did so quite rapidly. I think that as a kid, I could see that pretty soon I wouldn't have been able to urinate at all. I don't remember urination ever actually being painful but I had to do it sitting down otherwise I would have sprayed everywhere. I don't really remember any other feelings, certainly nothing along the lines of a change in masculinity which I can imagine I might feel if the event were happening now.<BR>
Is that of any use?<P>
Good to be able to share knowledge with you,<P>
<BR>

>Let me now ask a return question. I would be very interested if you can actually remember your feelings when you were a 9 yr. old and slowly started discovering that your foreskin was closing ... apart from the embarrassment in peeing competitions ... any memories??<BR>

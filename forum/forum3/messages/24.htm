As an answer to: <A HREF="8.htm">phimosis</A> written by RS at 11. Januar 2005 16:01:42:<P>

Hi, I can appreciate that developing foreskin conditions post puberty can be very distressing since it is not something you ever had to deal with beforehand. Individuals who are born with conditions naturally adapt their behavior to deal with the condition. Firstly you will probably be aware that you have a secondary phimosis which is typically considered to be a degenerative condition meaning your description of it enlargement is wholly normal where this condition is present. It is difficult to give you advice on what to do since your condition can be eased daily by stretching with the creams or alternatively can be completely eradicated by a full circumcision. The medical research available on this seems to suggest that it is inevitable that you will require a circumcision at some point unless some new treatment is developed. I think it depends on how it is affecting you now, if you are particularly bothered by it then go for the circumcision, if you feel you can continue using the creams then do so but be aware that the condition is never likely to go away using the creams. They merely help ease the foreskin on a daily basis but if the creams were stopped over a period of time the phimosis would tighten back to its original place. So basically the creams are to ease the condition but are by no means a cure, ultimately that is only available by surgical means. As for your comments regarding condoms, I would never take advice from anyone who recommends unprotected intercourse. I have never heard of condoms aggravating the condition although they may prove more difficult to put on phimosis patients who are cautious not to apply rearward pressure onto the foreskin. Medically I don't think condoms will affect your phimosis.<P>
I hope this helps<BR>

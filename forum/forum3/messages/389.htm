As an answer to: <A HREF="301.htm">Re: My Sons Skin Bridge</A> written by Robin at 30 Mar 2006 19:58:04:<P>

I was just informed today that my son (almost 2 1/2) has a skin bridge. First the nurse thought it was smegma when we spoke with her over the phone so we watched it for a few days trying to be sure to pull the foreskin far back during bath time, etc, but it only irritated it more and made my son very angry!<BR>
Now after bringing him into the doctor to look at it, I feel so bad learning that it is a skin bridge. I have never heard of this before. He was circumcised and I have not noticed anything prior. We are really good about his hygiene and always have been. I have always thought he had a lot of extra foreskin though. The pedi said, give him time, he will probably grow into it. Anyway, I just wanted to know how the procedure went for you, Leslie, or anyone else that may have had a child with this procedure done? It looked like there was something white stuck under his foreskin on one small section of his penis. It also has a little pin hole look at one part of it. What did your son's look like? I feel so bad for my little guy and I just hope that it is not hurting him. My appt with the urologist isn't for 2 months and that is just the consultation. I just want to make sure he is ok in the meantime. Any feedback is much appreciated. Thanks!

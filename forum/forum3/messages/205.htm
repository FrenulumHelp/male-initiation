>Hi, i have phimosis and having sex may make it worse if tears or leasions occur on the foreskin, alot of K-y jelly can stop this though (for me anyway).Condoms also worked to make it easier on the old man + I found that my condition meant i lasted a very long time. Girls may not have liked the look of it but enjoyed what I could do with it.<BR>
>Theres plus points to everything in life you see. Dont worry about the girl either mate, if your confident there should be no worries. I have had my fair share of partners and one night stands and no  woman has ever denied me after seeing it. I dont even tell them, if they ask we have a laugh about it and then I'l have sax with them again. <BR>
>I have started stretching now and I dont think it should take me much longer to be "normal" (As no blokes old man are the same). <P>
<BR>
I wholeheartedly agree - you'll find that the joke of your first time being over before it begins won't apply to you at all. i am 20 years old with "full" phimosis, and am looking to remedy this condition within the next several months. <P>
while we're on the subject....<P>
is anyone here able to "get off" with this condition? with the glans covered, i find myself not really being able to "feel" anything whatsoever - making sex less than pleasurable.

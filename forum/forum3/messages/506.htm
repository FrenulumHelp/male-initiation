  <I><B>Extra Note</B> I saw these letters from &quot;Rodger&quot; (i.e. Jim trolling again) too late and - take a look at the  &quot;advice&quot; of this fanatical anti circer: &quot;drama queen&quot; ... </I><I>This anti circer is a good example of the reason foreskin problems remain taboo even in the modern world ... MG answered very well and politely ... it made me very sad that I wasnt online enough  to defend MG and/or ban Rodger ... </I>

As an answer to: <A HREF="505.htm">A mixture of problems.</A> written by MG at 11 Jul 2007 15:22:09:
<P>

Hey look, you're very much the drama queen, aren't you?<P>
For better or worse, many if not most of those who come here do seem to be.<P>
You are correct insofar as there is something "wrong" with your foreskin - it doesn't retract, but it should.  On the other hand, the "problem" is no more nor less than that you have as you say - ignored it.  <I>Now</I> you are all "up in arms" about how "bad" it is and what you will have to do about it.  Why so suddenly?  What's wrong?<P>
You now say on the one hand that "without (this informative site) I probably would of been off to the doctors for a circumcision today", but that "I am going to ask for an adult circumsion when I finally manage to go to the Doctors".  What's your point?  Are you fixated on a(n unnecessary) circumcision or what?<P>
Let's see, you have "an unretractable foreskin whether flacid or hard with a bit of a skin overhanging" and yes, when you look at some (porn?) pictures, then that "seems less abnormal than I first thought actually".  Of course, if you are referring to the "overhang", that is <I>absolutely</I> normal, and there is no shortage of men with an unretractable foreskin - there must be <I>millions</I> worldwide, many or most of whom are either unaware or indeed the vast majority probably don't care - they just do what they do - get married, have children, get old and die.  It certainly isn't entirely "normal"; nor particularly desirable, but it most certainly does not prevent intercourse and fathering children - how or why would it anyway?<P>
Now, you have "lots of little bumps on the skin".  Hard to say, possibly an acne variant and most likely normal also.  I have to suspect too close an interest in examining the thing - can you find a picture that illustrates these?<P>
Now as to whether you masturbate or not - entirely up to you, friend!  As you say - you can masturbate quite easily.  How many other men - or women - have you masturbated?  Do you perhaps not realise that <I>anyone</I> would have to "make sure not to pull too hard and thus cause ... pain"?  And particularly so for circumcised men who have either to emulate a foreskin from whatever little remaining skin they have, or use a lubricant in order not to "rub themselves raw".<P>
So now the epiphany - you discovered that you <I>could</I> get your foreskin back and are surprised that things have been building up under there.  Your "white bumps all around the back end of the helmet" are called Pearly Penile Papules and are of course, quite <I>normal</I> (except on circumcised men in whom they have presumably "worn off" - how else could you explain that?).<P>
Why you would think you had "Balanitis" is rather obscure, except for some apparent determination to imagine things "wrong" with your penis and <I>that</I> determination is in itself, a - or <I>the</I> - disturbing aspect of your whole presentation here.<P>
The "connection between the underside of ... penis and the foreskin" is called a "fraenulum".  That's what a fraenulum <I>is</I>, it's the web that connects the two.  Of course, if you had a circumcision, there would be a fair chance you wouldn't have it, or most of it, because removing it tends to be part of the operation.<P>
What else?  A virgin - clearly, but that's another matter entirely.  I certainly don't think you <I>should</I> "impose this penis on anybody" for a number of reasons, you are clearly not emotionally ready for it, and you haven't learned to "drive" the thing yet.<P>
"Wet dreams" are an interesting matter - it is quite likely that you masturbated sufficiently often to suppress them, but their frequency varies greatly - even for an individual.<P>
It's hard to say, but <I>perhaps</I> you need to see a counsellor or psychiatrist about your personal and social maladjustment because seeing a doctor and potentially having unnecessary genital surgery certainly isn't going to attend to that.<P>
That said, you certainly <I>should</I> attend to the retraction problems; you need to stretch your foreskin and probably, your fraenulum so that you can retract easily.  I commend to you the resources pointed to you in my previous posts here, just go and search them out.<BR>

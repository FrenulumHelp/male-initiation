   Robin,<p>
    Thank you for producing one of the best internet sites I have ever had<br>
the pleasure to visit. Extensively researched and balanced. Your thinking is<br>
clear and logical. I could not agree with you more. Please consider<br>
expanding you site to include other related issues.<p>
    I am a fifty year old heterosexual male. Born in Canada, 1956, I was one<br>
of the few infant males of my generation who was not circumcised. This was<br>
at the request of my parents. I have no problem with my parents decision. In<br>
fact, I now see they were thinking in my best interest and perhaps well<br>
ahead of their time. I do not suffer any of the condition discussed in your<br>
site. I function sexually just fine. I'm married with three grown children.<p>
    However, during my childhood and now subsequently as an adult I still<br>
feel somewhat embarrassed with my status as a non circumcised male. This is<br>
not logical. It is purely an emotional issue. We are complex creatures. I<br>
suspect as a young and somewhat venerable child I felt different. For years<br>
I have considered being circumcised which has lead me to many internet sites<br>
on the topic. Most are either pro or anti on the subject. Many try to<br>
mislead people. Advocating they have a balance view when really they tend to<br>
be the most radical and bent on swaying public opinion to their view.<p>
    What I have read as an educated fifty year old male is very<br>
contradictory. I can't imagine what young expecting parents must go through.<br>
This is should not be an issue which causes anxiety. But it does in many<br>
families and individuals.<p>
    My research and thinking on the subject has lead me to some conclusions.<br>
One thing I feel very strongly about is that routine infant circumcision is<br>
simply wrong. How can a parent make this decision for their child unless<br>
there is a physical need. Confiding with my best friend on the subject, he<br>
wishes his parents had not circumcised him. He feels he lacks sensation as a<br>
result. <p>
    In my case, I have two unresolved questions. One; is there a significant<br>
reduction of sensation resulting from circumcision? Logically we would have<br>
to expect there would be. However here too we get conflicting reports from<br>
men who have gone through this are adults. Some say no change and others<br>
report significant change. Who is telling the truth? This is very important.<br>
Not only too men like me but also to expectant parents struggling with the<br>
issue. The second; What do women really think? What do they prefer? I'm of<br>
the opinion that the majority of women prefer circumcised men and that<br>
society especially here in North America supports that view. However, when<br>
talking to women. Most seem to say they don't care one way or the other if a<br>
man is circumcised or not. Well, again, what is the truth.<p>
    I would be interested in your opinion. Has your research lead you to any<br>
conclusions regarding sensation and women's preference?<p>
    What about the difference in sexual function? More confusing data.<p>

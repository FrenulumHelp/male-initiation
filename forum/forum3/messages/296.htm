As an answer to: <A HREF="293.htm">phimosis</A> written by toms at 19 Mar 2006 18:17:40:<P>

Hi toms,<P>
First I note Germany. I am in Hamburg, not gay, and interested in meeting -<P>
Where are you from if youre not German?<P>
Its good to hear that the Urologists here are offering <I>various</I> surgical solutions, rather than just putting one on the table and saying this is what you must have ... he was very kind and thoughtful.<P>
If you go to a dermatologist (skin specialist) they will know far more about stretching skin and probably advise stretching. Stretching will almost certainly work with a primary phimotic ring (you have a phimotic ring holding your foreskin back - and it is a primary ring because it was from birth, it was not caused by any secondary infection etc.)<P>
You say its almost like a pinhole phimosis - am I to assume that you cant retract even when flaccid (not erect)? <P>
Did the urologist check if you have any other problem lurking behind the foreskin such as a frenulum breve? - Did he use a probe to examine this?<P>
Regarding the phimotic ring, you have a large choice of treatments, and really it depends on what you want to end up with.<P>
If you want to keep your foreskin at all costs then you must stretch, takes two weeks, needs repeating throughout life, but becomes easier to do and a natural habit ...<P>
All operations take around 40 mins. (at least 30 mins goes on preparation)<P>
I would advise against dorsal slit for pinhole phimosis, as the slit will need to be 2 or 3 cms. long and will leave you with 2 skin flaps which often does not please the wearer.<P>
I tend to often advise partial circumcision, and thats what I will do in your case. Partial circumcision removes the foreskin overhang and will leave a covering for the glans when flaccid and retract easily when erect.<P>
I advise this in your case in preference to stretching, because I believe the "late initiate" i.e. someone who has gone through several adult years with the problem, needs a specific and definate "intiation" to be able to then adjust to new habits etc. Though, this is a point we could spend several letters discussing.<P>
That you have the offer of preputial plasty is suprising. Usually this would cost extra money. --- What sort of plasty?<P>
To get more answers from me, I need to ask more questions on the state of the frenulum, and on how tight the phimotic ring is. <P>
One answer is quite clear, get it sorted out while you are still under German health care ... France - England etc, you will have to wait ages and you wont get specialist doctors without bureaucratic problems.<P>
And now, actually far more important to me than your specific penis problem ... is that you are 32 yrs. old and never had true sexual intercourse ... as you are probably aware, my site concentrates on attempting to get children monitored for these problems before puberty, and then most of the questions on this forum would not become problems in the first place ... The medical profession seems largely unaware of the necessity of monitoring boys before puberty. <P>
If you would be so kind to tell me your sexual experiences or lack of them, and your feelings about if this was possibly caused or not helped by your phimosis, then this would be very helpful ... publicising such stories is the best way to inform the medical profis about this seemingly century long taboo on phimosis.<P>
cheers<BR>
aand good luck<P>

>Hi,<BR>
>I am 32 years old male currently staying at Germany.Recently found that I had phimosis. It's like almost pinhole phimosis. I never had true sexual intercourse. Urination and masturbation wasn't ever painful. Some months before, I met urologist here, he was kind enough to describe several options: circumcision, partial circumcision, dorsal slit etc.But he don't think strecthing/steriod creme would be helpful.<BR>
>I would like to know how I can decide which alternative among preputial plasty , partial phimosis or dorsalslit would be better in my case. <BR>
>thanks.<BR>
>kind regards<BR>

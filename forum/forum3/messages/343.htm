Hi Nero,<P>
The more I hear about your general complaints the more I think you might have a form of frenulum breve, ... did you send pictures? if so then I will get them with my email and answer next week - <P>
One other point now that we have made some progress with inserting a q-tip, to check for frenulum breve you could rotate the q tip round your glans (underneath the foreskin) you should be able to do this quite freely unless there is a frenulum problem where on the underside of the glans the q-tip snags or catches on the ridge of the frenulum .... does it catch on the frenulum?  ... see male-initiation.net/diagnosis.html bottom of the page "the probe check" for more details.<P>
Paraphimosis is the correct word. It is not only the rubbing which retracts the foreskin, the foreskin will automatically retract as you become more erect.<P>
>And now i have 2 questions..<BR>
1) Would stretching expand the phimotic ring so it will not become stuck behind the glans?<P>
Yes (or in most cases yes)- stretching will make the ring more elastic<P>
>2) Is there any possible way to ensure that the foreskin stays covering the glans as i rub against her (i.e. same as rubbing against bedclothes)?<P>
yes there is - (the correct word is infibulation) - but its not going to be comfortable or very helpful - the old romans and Greeks used to practice infibulation when they didnt want sex. .. I suppose you could use numerous different clips/glue/stapler (do NOT take me seriously) - sorry Nero but this isnt the question or answer you are looking for.<P>
There are no videos on stretching, but I believe many of the anti-circumcision sites do have extra information on stretching. (tell us if you find anything good)<P>
>Another question/problem with stretching..<BR>
>My foreskin only can be pulled about 1/2 - 1 inch in front of the glans and if i put any type of pinch pressure it kinda hurts. <P>
re: frenulum breve - can you pull it forward more on top or underneath? <P>
>I manage to get one Q tip in but i have to roll my way in with the other one while pinching the skin a little. then when i stretch it, i only feel a stretch right at the point where i'm stretching, is that the ridge i'm supposed to be working at? I would think the tight part, that i want to stretch is somewhere half way down the glans (while flaccid). <P>
The bit you want to stretch is actually not half way back along the glans - it is right up front ... it slants and slopes so that on top it is right at the front of the foreskin, on the sides about 1 cm. in and underneath maybe 4 cms. back where it joins with the frenulum. This is not a very good description, you will need "Drawing 5" on male-initiation.net/phimosis_research.html to clarify this.<P>
It is essential that we diagnose your frenulum - trying to stretch against an unstretchable frenulum will be more difficult and probably result in frustration - so please do everything to diagnose this. OK <P>

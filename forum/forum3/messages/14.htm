treatment - phimosis<P>
First of all, I would prefer my name (email address)  to be <BR>
kept private...<P>
English Male, 36 yrs old,, obviously un-cut,, <P>
I really don't know how the necrotic process began,,, but <BR>
intimacy issues arose literally between my wife and I<P>
flexibility was starting to decrease, bringing first of all <BR>
discomfort and then pain,, the pain I fear to say would <BR>
over-ride the pleasure of intimacy, so ED arose only when <BR>
the head was fully exposed,, otherwise excessive <BR>
lubrication had to be used as not to force the skin to <BR>
retract,, this theory did work short term for me but not <BR>
for my wife who would complain about excessive 'moisture', <BR>
thus, this treated the symptom not the cause...<P>
Being an Engineer,,, like all mechanical function,, the <BR>
idea of inserting<BR>
cylindrical object to stretch it out,,, this I did for what <BR>
must seem to be at least half a year,, but it only gave <BR>
short term stretch/relief but the continual pain/itching <BR>
did not make me a social/sexual creature, plus<BR>
the continual adjustment did make me look like I was <BR>
infected,, according to my wife I would 'adjust' <BR>
automatically without thinking where I was,, so onto the <BR>
next step<P>
At its worst, I paid a visit to a Urologist early February <BR>
2003 where constriction was about 3/4 Diameter, with <BR>
excessive pain to retract, I had the dreaded hour glass <BR>
silhouette.<P>
I asked about d-slit,  cream  or some new procedure, being <BR>
cut wasn't preferred but an option he wanted,<BR>
at the time I had a rash so he prescribed a steroid cream <BR>
0.25 percent which cleaned up the rash (this will become <BR>
apparent later) So being cut wasn't what I wanted to hear <BR>
so I decided to do some internet search, hence your <BR>
website.... thanks<P>
So, the theory of a more aggressive stretching came to <BR>
mind,, now for the last 6 weeks,, every time I use the <BR>
bathroom I do some therapy,,<BR>
started out with being able to insert 2 index finger tips <BR>
and manipulate the 'ring"... (when you see stars or your <BR>
legs get weak, its time to release) over time the diameter <BR>
started to stretch,,, this was more apparent the more <BR>
aggressive I got,, the pain I felt I would prefer to be <BR>
highly intense for a few minutes each hour rather than <BR>
continual aggravation of the previous method.  I used a <BR>
star pattern (pull and release and then re-clock the <BR>
fingers about 60 degrees and start again) ,,, during the <BR>
course of the day and assumed 5 Mins. x 12 time a day,, at <BR>
the end of the days routine the 'ring' would eventually be <BR>
the same diameter of the un-effected skin..<P>
the medication would be applied prior to bed and then the <BR>
process of stretching would begin again the next day.. <BR>
showing a little loss of the previous days gain,, that <BR>
being expected,,, skin color changed too,, prior to <BR>
stretching the ring was a whitish  band,, but the continual <BR>
stretching and breaking of the skin would turn a dark <BR>
purple/dark red,,, now the skin tone looks normal and <BR>
currently doing a more of a maintenance stretch and<BR>
application of medication...nominally at 1.25 Diameter... <BR>
:)))<P>
Hope this helps,, It may work for some<P>
xx<BR>

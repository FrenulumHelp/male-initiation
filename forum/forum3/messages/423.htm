  Hi all!  I have a question which needs either many answers (from many people) or somebody who's seen lots of penises! This is it: does the foreskin of a normal penis (one with no frenulum breve, fimosis or anything else) retract naturally all the way? Meaning does it unfold completely?   Does it unfold "by itself" during an erection, or do you have to manually pull it back?  And when you pull it back should it have any resistance or not?   <P>
  I think these are helpful questions and also in this site it would be REALLY helpful to have a detailed description of a healthy penis (circumcised and not)in the erect stage and flaccid.  <P>
  <BR>
   I'm interested in this question because, with the great help in being informed by this very good site, I had a laser frenuloplasty and a partial circumsicion. And still my foreskin doesn't retract fully (even though only half of it is there!). In fact it stays unfolded if not pulled back manually. If it is pulled back, it bends the glans down, and the pulling is felt at the area where the frenulum was.  That gives me the suspicion that there is still remaining frenulum tissue that needs to be removed.  Also the area is whitish still and it's been more than a year since the operation.In the photos of "Frenuloplasty by tying up the frenulum page" there is no sign of the frenulum left, the area is red, not white, and as far as I can imagine has full elasticity as the rest of the foreskin. My white area is totally rigid as the frenulum tissue.  <BR>
  <BR>
  Is it supposed to be like that or not? I'll ask the doctor as well of course, I just wanted to get an image of what its supposed to be normally.And the doctors , as we all know , haven't seen penises in the erect state, but all they see is flaccid.   <P>
   Thanks and sorry for the long message!

<BR>

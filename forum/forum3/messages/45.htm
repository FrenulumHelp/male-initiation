As an answer to: <A HREF="20.htm">Re: self cut</A> written by Robin at 16 Feb 2005 19:38:06:<P>

AS MY Foreskin is now Permenantly retracted and has been for most of my Life I can with some authority give some Advice on the subject.<BR>
Firstly the earlier you start the better,and I believe that all boys should be educated on the working of their penis from as early as 6 year old, When some nominal movement of the Foreskin shoud be evident. No force should be needed.   But it is the right time to discover any problems.<BR>
The Foreskin should retract over the Glans completely by the Midteens.<BR>
It is normal for the Foreskin to retract on it's own with an erection , But  many men have to give it a helping hand, Butwhen making Love to a Woman it should slide back.<BR>
The Foreskin will normally crawl forward on it's own, <BR>
If you like the feeling of having the head bare;you are going to need to be a little more tougher on your Foreskin, Than just pushing it back down over the edge of the head (glans)(and this takes time).<BR>
The first bit of advice I will give you is trim your pubic hair,(it can be very uncomfortable when you have your foreskin retracted and it begins to crawl forward catching in your pubic hair)Especially around the base of your Penis; Even shave that area and along the Shaft:with care!! <P>
It is best to do this lying down<P>
If you have you Foreskin Forward? retract it; which should bring on an erection,If it is retracted and you have to induce an erection.Do so: But try only using the skin under the glans,as The purpose is to get hard only and not to jerk off.<BR>
When you are erect With one hand Push as much skin as will move towards the base of your penis,and hold it tightly there,with your other hand. Your glans may even bend a little<BR>
Now while it is good and tight,use your pelvis to push your penis out of your body.(just like you would having sex. If you  are doing it right,you should feel a slight strain on the skin.<BR>
YOU should be able to hold this position for a while then let your pelvis relax wait a while and repeat; you may get to a stage when pre-cum begins to flow. You may like the tightness and the look.You will also notice over time that the glans and indeed your penis is getting bigger   This can take many months or more but you can stretch it enough where the frenulum is pretty much non-functional, and if you're like me  waking one morning and discovering that my Foreskin was still retracted from the night before and hadn't craweled Forward you'll know you have done it<BR>
I still enjoy the feeling of the glans touching my pants<P>

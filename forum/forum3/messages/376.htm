Hi Mr. 17 yr.old,<P>
First thanks for educating yourself so well, except on the point of stretching your frenulum which appears not to work - I believe the idea is a rumour which has been spread by those fanatically against foreskin operations - from all I can see, it doesnt work, and unless you have lots of free time to experiment then it is simply not advisable, especially as you indicate that you have a mixture of conditions (ie. a phimotic ring and a frenulum breve) - so lets just rethink.<P>
>When flaccid, mine retracts partially(about halfway on the glans), foreskin squeezes a little around the glans, or is this contributed by the frenulum?<P>
It is considerably contributed by the frenulum, but "foreskin squeezes a little around the glans" sounds like a partial mild type of phimotic ring. It sounds like due to this phimotic ring you cant get your foreskin back far enough to make the glans bend downwards. <P>
You definately have a frenulum breve. Your phimotic ring can probably be stretched without too many problems, but your frenulum breve needs to be cured before you can start stretching your "ring". Therefore "gradually pull down my foreskin and stretch it frequently for the next 1-2 months" will have no effect, or only very little, the frenulum needs fixing first.<P>
If you cannot retract when flaccid then you cant see how the frenulum holds your foreskin forward ... you can only feel this tension ... maybe you could identify whats happening inside your foreskin and how the frenulum works by looking at www.male-initiation.net/frenulum/frenuloplasty/frenulum_pics.html - if your frenulum is attached up near the front of the penis glans then it will hold the foreskin forward.<P>
Is it urgent to cure? what other problems can arise? well from my point of view, pain during sex is a good enough simple reason and the main one. During masturbation you can avoid the problems by simply not retracting your foreskin, however you are hardly in a position to have uninhibited fun with a girl. I would have thought that was fairly important ... how urgent it is, is up to you.<P>
You know I only just discovered this tying the frenulum method, it seems the best of all treatments, because its so simple and leaves no scar. Any of the frenuloplasty treatments are efficient, its just if you can get it tied, then this is my best suggestion, and the measure could be performed by any normal GP, so it requires no specialist appointments, waiting lists etc. etc. <P>
If I was in your shoes, no point waiting two months, Id do my examinations, and then go and see my family doctor and take him a print out of the tying html and ask him to do this.<P>
Then see how far you can retract and maybe start stretching the phimotic ring, but leave such considerations until after you have gotten the frenulum fixed.<P>
Thanks for your compliments over my site. Once you get yourself cured then maybe youd like to support me/the site and project in some way.<P>
cheers<P>

>What are the problems that would arise from a non-retractable foreskin besides pain during sex?(As in the problems that would arise due to lack of hygeine on the glans.) How to prevent them when i have difficulty washing the glans? I had yet to experience any inflammation.<BR>
>I am very grateful that you have set up this website and the forum which in a way had helped many people. Your site is the most and only informative source on this problem. Also, i very much appreciate the effort and the time you have spent to update this website since '96. It is a relief for society.<BR>

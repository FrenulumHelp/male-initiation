Hi Irwan,<P>
I wanted to add. I also had a rough cut, - done freehand. The doctor<BR>
told me it was a partial circumcision and what he actually did was a<BR>
loose circ.. This means that the inner foreskin is removed and the<BR>
outer foreskin is turned over facing the glans. (In addition the<BR>
frenulum area was removed even though I had previously had a<BR>
successful frenuloplasty)<P>
One can imagine my frustration and anger - among other difficulties,<BR>
nowadays I am constantly reminded because of the smell: the outer<BR>
foreskin doesnt breathe or absorb the moisture or whatever it is - so<BR>
I have to wash with soap every day ... (previously and healtwise one<BR>
only needs water) ... ridiculous idiocy of modern medicine on such<BR>
points - the doctors have been doing it for centuries and it seems<BR>
everyone was too embarrassed to complain.<P>
Anyway, there are various warnings about this on my site, and this<BR>
possibility of expression is my main form of therapy, on various<BR>
points (thank God for internet).<P>
So, I wanted to suggest you adopt a similar therapy, about your<BR>
lasered frenulum, and the tying method you found online, I wanted to<BR>
invite you to revise or rewrite my frenulum_treatment.html (I can do<BR>
the html for you).<P>
If you wanted you could write a separate page which I link to, or a<BR>
warning or a paragraph and we could add a link to my<BR>
frenulum_treatment file. But this would not be as predominant - (and<BR>
thus not as good therapy) as if you rewrote the entire main frenulum<BR>
treatment page.<P>
There are several short studies under<BR>
male-initiation.net/frenulum_studies.html#treatment   also one on<BR>
laser techniques, which maybe you could check out.<P>
It seems to me the best way to let off steam is to try and turn the<BR>
experience into something constructive - as best possible.<P>
The site gets 77,000 page views a month now (page views arent hits,<BR>
hits are far more cos they include gifs etc.) and<BR>
frenulum_treatment.html gets around 1,700 per month ... so theres an<BR>
audience, and there are just other files I need to update more<BR>
urgently.<P>
Its nice to have your email address, I spent a good hour considering<BR>
your photos etc. but just dont get much time to think about other<BR>
things when Im online (I live in an isolated garden house - peaceful<BR>
and old-fashioned, use a friends broadband once a week to answer the<BR>
forum and do technical stuff)<P>
I also wanted to explain why I always post letters on the forum, as I<BR>
will post this : in the disclaimer it just says to get the info out in<BR>
public, this is very important, but also its purely the work of filing<BR>
and saving letters and organising them to refind them, the threads on<BR>
these Forums are an ideal sorting system.
<P>
so hope youre coping well<P>
cheers<P>
Rob<P>

As an answer to: <a href="459.htm">problem retracting</a> written by  sam at 14 Dec 2006 18:44:56:<p>

Hello sam,<p>
hummm what comes out of your letter is this.<p>
99% certain that the something you ripped when 12/13 yrs, was the<br>
frenulum, this often bleeds and then simply rejoins due to coagulation<br>
of the blood.<p>
99% certain that the hourglass description indicates a relative<br>
phimosis (ie one which can be retracted when flaccid but not when<br>
erect)<p>
So this means Im 98% sure that you have both a frenulum breve and a<br>
mild degree of phimosis.<p>
Which kind of doctor to see depends on what sort of treatment you<br>
choose ... simplest may be a surgeon ... however stretching and<br>
steroids are possible for the phimotic ring ... see<br>
http://www.male-initiation.net/phimosis_treatment.html<p>
Full circumcision can almost always be avoided.<p>
Its not an easy subject, and unfortunately few doctors have really<br>
studied it, so in my opinion this means you must do a bit more<br>
homework if you want an optimal cure.<p>
see also<br>
http://www.male-initiation.net/frenulum_treatment.html<p>
If you go to a doctor for diagnosis be sure to inform him of the mild<br>
degree of phimosis - in a flaccid examination he will ceratinly miss<br>
this, and it is only rarely that he will ask ...<p>
please read a bit more and good luck<p>
If you write back please tell us what your specific symptoms are, this site<br>
is established to inform on the sexual/psychological influence of phimosis -<br>
treatment is only an appendix on my site - treatment is the doctors department<br>
- once the medical profession start realising how much phimosis can mess up sex<br>
and emotions and behaviour etc. they could develop hundreds of different ways<br>
to check for and treat these conditions which I cant even imagine - my job is<br>
only to show what the problems are and bring this to the light of day.<p>
So please tell me what your problems were with your condition eg<br>
during masturbation etc. and<br>
did you attempt sex with this condition? what happened?<p>
cheers <br>
Robin<p>

As an answer to: <A HREF="281.htm">Just confused...</A> written by Shawn at 08 Mar 2006 19:39:49:<P>

Hi Shawn,<P>
Im not suprised that you are confused. - I checked out your previous postings, and you gave very clearly the picture on http://www.foreskin.org/tilted5.jpg<P>
You have a partial phimotic ring ... <P>
Your doctor is one of those who do not understand the condition of phimosis. <P>
The simplest thing to do would be to go to another doctor. If you are stuck with this one doctor then you could try explaining to him the following quote:<P>
DYSPAREUNIA<BR>
Alan J. Wabrek, M.D., and Carolyn J. Wabrek, M.Ed.<BR>
Journal of Sex and Marital Therapy<BR>
Spring 1975: Vol.1, No.3, Pages: 234-41<P>
"During the physical examination, most males don't get an erection, so it is difficult to find out if the foreskin will retract over the erect glans; therefore, this must be elicitated by history. The teaching point is that just because the foreskin slides over the flaccid penis does not mean it is going to slide over the erect penis."<P>
During erection, the phimotic ring expands <I>less</I> than the surrouding foreskin.<P>
Alternatively you could take a picture of yourself during erection with attempted retraction, and then show it to him. (and send it to me, as I am presently collecting photos of the conditions).<P>
From what I understand your doctor retracted when flaccid, but later at home, you could not do this, ... I suspect this might lie in the variation in size the penis has when flaccid. To explain: when erect the penis is always say 6 inches long, however when flaccid, sometimes it is normal sometimes cold and shrivelled, i.e. all different sorts of lengths and sizes. I suspect at the doctors you were maybe in fear, and your penis shrivelled, and thus the foreskin could be retracted.<P>
I am 99% sure this is physical and not psychological.<P>
My advice at this stage (previously you asked specifically about operations and pain etc.) my advice is normally to try stretching this phimotic ring, in many many cases one can avoid an operation. <P>
So, I would ask you to check out <A HREF="../../../stretching.html">www.male-initiation.net/stretching.html</A><P>
There are some doubts in my mind that stretching might not work, because we have never done a complete diagnosis, and I dont know if there might be a degree of frenulum breve also hindering your retraction ... to check this simply go to <A HREF="../../../phimosis_summary.html">www.male-initiation.net/phimosis_summary.html</A> the fourth little section describes frenulum breve.<P>
Which country are you in? in the UK one is pretty much stuck to one GP. and its hard to see the specialists. It is a funny world, but I reckon if you go to a surgeon - he will want to cut; if you go to a reassuring bedside house doctor, he will reassure that nothing is wrong; if you go to a dermatologist (a skin doctor) he will suggest stretching.<P>
Basicly it seems the medical world is in chaos on the subject of phimosis.<P>
Dont let them boggle you - :) - if you cant retract your foreskin you are going to have some sort of sexual problems/restrictions when it comes to women - you know this all -<P>
Id suggest just take it easy - it just looks as though the road is a little more bumpy than we expected - read and learn a bit more - Im here every week to answer questions - and we will slowly find a solution.<P>
cheers<P>

>I've posted here before regarding phimosis but I have another problem and I'd appriciate an honest answer.<BR>
>I saw the doctor today to get a proper diagnosis on my phimosis. He check it anyway and managed to fully retract my forskin while flaccid. He said it was fine and I didn't have phimosis after all. An hour later at home, I decided to try retract my foreskin now knowing that I supposedly didn't have phimosis after all.<BR>
>The problem is, I can't seem to retract it at all by myself. I don't know if this is just phycological or physical. I've heard that a proper diagnosis can't be made with a flaccid penis.<BR>
>I'm very confused and slightly down in myself again. I just need some advice. <BR>
>Thanks.<BR>

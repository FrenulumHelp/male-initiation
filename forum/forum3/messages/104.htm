As an answer to: <A HREF="98.htm">Partial phimosis</A> written by Bryan at 07 Oct 2005 16:21:58:<P>

Hi Brian,<P>
I will answer your letter in bits because it will be easier for me. Your English is mostly good enough, (better than some English people! where are you from?) but you might need to rephrase a couple of your questions.<P>
The first thing which occurs to me, is have you got frenulum breve??? (go to the map at the top of this page, click on frenulum breve or simply to start with on conditions and read the summary)<P>
>Hi all,<BR>
>I think I have been subject to ignorance throughout my life until now. You see I live in a society where this problem is still taboo, not to tell how indifferent  my parents were. <P>
Parents arent taught about this, - maybe they were indifferent in other ways, but even the most caring parent is uninformed about foreskins.<P>
>I am aged 17 and it all began when I retracted my foreskin for the very first time (which is quite unusual at that age). I thought my penis with the foreskin still on the glans when erected was something normal. Soon, I discovered the difference when I started to watch those explicit films how different was my penis with those guys.<P>
It is amazing, almost something to be thankful for, but these days most education on this subject seems to go through pornography!!! - I suppose one day the medical profession will catch up.<P>
>The cause for my phimosis, which I think is now partial, was that I had unusual masturbatory practices: I stroke the glans through the foreskin in the usual way, but attempt to pull the skin towards the tip of the penis instead of pulling it back toward the pubis. In this way the tubular foreskin of infancy had persisted. <P>
This form of masturbation is very common among boys with phimosis. But the tubular foreskin of infancy remains also among men who masturbate normally, however they have no phimotic ring to stretch.<P>
>The still biggest mistake was that I have been forcing my foreskin behind my glans thus causing immense pain. Which I know is unwise now because of those delicate nerves and so on. But could you answer my questions.<P>
Now, this is why I believe you might have frenulum breve, if you had a phimotic ring you might have caused paraphimosis, when the foreskin gets stuck behind the glans, which is painful, and a massive shock, but when your reported symptom is merely "immense pain" ... I feel 90% sure you indicate frenulum breve, so could you please check this.<P>
I believe your other questions might be irrelevant, (and they are hard to understand as well :) so I might just make both our lives easier by leaving it there ... I will continue regardless)<P>
>1."Do you think I must still continue stretching my foreskin in the meantime coz I found a net amelioration in the wideness of the foreskin. Could it be to a complete retraction when in erection?" <P>
sorry dont understand, could you rephrase this, - and from all reliable reports, stretching wont help frenulum breve - it will probably rip it<P>
>2."What are the other methods of stretching the foreskin because the way I am doing is making to and fro motions when my penis is flaccid but the difficulty arises when erection begins?"<P>
stretching is most effective when erect (and more fun) ... go to the pretty map again go to conditions, go to full phimotic ring index, go to stretching.html for more fun ideas. <P>
>3."What is the difference between partial circumcision and circumcision itself?" Is there still some of my foreskin on (i.e 1/3 gone off) because I intend to preserve almost all.<P>
partial circumcision removes the "tubular foreskin of infancy" leaving covering for the glans when flaccid (non-erect) and retracting fully when erect, full circumcision removes the entire covering, so that when falccid there is no covering. In my personal opinion partial circumcision is far preferable<P>
>My last question is: "Does the foreskin automatically pull back when a normal guy erects or vice-versa?"<P>
depends how long the foreskin is ... lets say normally it reveals the head of the glans.<P>
>I think that's all and hope I have been comprehensible.<BR>
>(I excuse for my English if ever it was bad) <BR>
>Before leaving I hope I will get the answers I am looking for? <BR>
>Kind Regards <P>
I hope they were the answers you were looking for.<P>
Good luck with the research on frenulum breve<P>

(back next Wednesday - only Wednesday - so youve 6 days to think)<BR>

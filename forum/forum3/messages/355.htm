As an answer to: <A HREF="354.htm">Frenulum Breve</A> written by Max at 18 May 2006 19:44:19:<P>

Hi Max,<P>
There is a big rumour going round about stretching the frenulum, I<BR>
personally have never seen any really trustwrothy reports of this<BR>
being successful ... however I have recently started experimenting<BR>
with stretching the frenulum with a couple of people on my forum, but<BR>
I always say after two weeks with no improvement then we must consider<BR>
the operation. Maybe it is successful with specific frenulum types, in<BR>
one percent the cases, but generally it certainly cannot be stretched<BR>
in the same way as the phimotic ring.<P>
I can actually imagine which forum you were on. Its a yellow coloured<BR>
forum - called something like the tight foreskin and circumcision<BR>
forum - it was stolen from me last year by the guy AJ who I entrusted<BR>
with moderating it for me and unbiased info. ... a nasty little story<BR>
of lies and betrayal which Im fairly sure does not interest you at<BR>
all!<P>
OK, I will accept your wish to carry on stretching the foreskin, but<BR>
actually after two months regular stretching you should be able to<BR>
retract fully! and not merely a quarter of the way! And is this in the<BR>
flaccid state or when erect? So, I feel I must ask are you sure you<BR>
dont want to consider a partial circ. ...<P>
I am also not excactly sure how the frenuloplasty works - there are<BR>
various different methods. Its usually called an elongation of the<BR>
frenulum, but what it does is actually remove the frenular ridge and<BR>
sew it into the shaft skin.<P>
One form of frenuloplasty is described (by Harmen) and another by the<BR>
medical studies, linked out from<BR>
www.male-initiation.net/frenulum_index.html look for "Pictures<BR>
frenuloplasty" and under the "complete medical studies" modern<BR>
treatment.<P>
Really there are so many different cures for the frenulum, maybe<BR>
someday I will catergorise them all, I have never heard any complaints<BR>
from this operation except once from a guy who had it done with a<BR>
laser.<P>
Yes this operation is what you want - I always recommend a surgeon as<BR>
they have more experience with surgery than an Urologist. However even<BR>
a local GP could do the knotting procedure ... but you would probably<BR>
need to explain it to him yourself.<P>
Yes it is necessary for the foreskin to retract in the flaccid state<BR>
in order to get at the frenulum to operate on it. Tying is probably<BR>
the only method of treating a frenulum if the foreskin does not retract.<P>
I really suggest you get yourself informed at www.male-initiation.net/frenulum_index.html<BR>
and then get in touch again.<P>
Cheers<P>
Robin<P>

As an answer to: <A HREF="285.htm">Frenulum Breve</A> written by Sav at 09 Mar 2006 19:47:07:<P>

<BR>
Hi Sav,<P>
Firstly I must say I am not a doctor.<P>
To answer your question I feel I have to appeal to your common sense.<P>
You approached a Urologist and he told you that your "foreskin looks<BR>
normal and that I may want to wait until my first sexual contact to<BR>
see if I do indeed experience any difficulty."<P>
Doesnt this seem remarkable? - I presume that the urologist did not<BR>
see your erect penis, and also did not enquire about it? and all he<BR>
can say is go forth into the joy and amazing experience of first<BR>
intercourse with someone you love with the possibility that something<BR>
will go wrong, ... and did he not even say what might go wrong?<P>
Modern medicine will soon be able to predict the medical future from<BR>
all your genes, but still does not understand foreskin problems, even<BR>
when confronted directly with a problem. (... naturally a<BR>
generalisation which applies to many but not all urologists).<P>
I can guarantee that with a frenulum breve, your intercourse will not<BR>
be as enjoyable as it could be, the frenulum will either rip or be<BR>
sore afterwards, or maybe your future wife will touch you in some new<BR>
way or area which will be unpleasant ... I give one of these a 100%<BR>
chance, and if you miss this with the nerves and everything on the<BR>
first time, then it will catch you on the second!<P>
If we go into detail and you describe your frenulum as thin almost<BR>
translucent, then I would guess it will rip; if it is tough and thick,<BR>
then this will more likely lead to soreness.<P>
First then in my appeal to common sense, is your own undeniable<BR>
experience that retracting the foreskin fully causes pain (naturally<BR>
this is only really of any relevance to the sexuality when erect) ...<BR>
lets confirm this experience, and identify that the pain comes from<BR>
the frenulum (nothing you say indicates partial phimosis, or a<BR>
phimotic ring --- when fully retracting and at the pain threshold, is<BR>
there any evidence of a tight ring often visible in an hour glass<BR>
shape round the shaft? if there is please tell me; if there is not<BR>
then ignore the question).<P>
So, is it your experience during erection that this tight frenular<BR>
ridge underneath the glans is the cause of the discomfort and pain?<P>
Touch this ridge ... is it painful? you could ask - how have you<BR>
avoided this pain during masturbation for so many years? - many men<BR>
avoid the pain by masturbating while pulling the foreskin forward ...<P>
ask yourself how it would be without your hands controlling your<BR>
erection and foreskin (has your future wife ever played with you? -<BR>
you dont have to answer - just consider ... some men who are unaware<BR>
of the possibility of an operation simply ask their girl friends not<BR>
to touch them there - what a shame, the most sensitive area of the<BR>
erect penis becomes untouchable ... )<P>
ask yourself how it would be without your hands controlling your<BR>
foreskin and keeping it forward ... during penetration especially, but<BR>
also just during intercourse when her vagina may grip the penis shaft<BR>
... I could take a step too wide and suggest your future wife is also<BR>
probably not very sexually experienced, who knows how the lubrication<BR>
might be and her degree of vaginal openness ... but probably she might<BR>
have some sort of nervousness ... and so this sounds like the sort of<BR>
situation where the foreskin is gripped tight and the frenulum is<BR>
suddenly pulled and rips, causing bleeding and pain and ruining first<BR>
intercourse ...<P>
Excuse me for thinking too much but if maybe you have put off having<BR>
sex before marriage for religious reasons then you could consider<BR>
terms like untouchable impurity and then initiation confirmation ...<BR>
and really we needed the initiation before sexual activity and<BR>
fulfillment in love, even before we get to puberty and not like me at<BR>
43 and you at 28<P>
I must say that unless there is something I have overlooked in your<BR>
surface descruption - your Urologist should definately have suggested<BR>
a frenuloplasty (see  male-initiation.net/frenulum_treatment.html ).<P>
Please stay cool calm and collected, do nothing hasty and rushed, but<BR>
please first get a truly accurate diagnosis - DO THIS YOURSELF - you<BR>
have already discovered that the urologists dosent understand erect<BR>
problems of the foreskin --- either that or go to another urologist or<BR>
surgeon - and then I believe you will want to start thinking about a<BR>
frenuloplasty, (see male-initiation.net/frenulum_treatment.html ).<P>
excuse me for getting carried away but I quite enjoyed answering<P>
keep in touch - silly questions dont annoy me<P>
cheers<P>

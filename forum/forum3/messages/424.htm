>HI Danny,<BR>
>Very nice letter thanks-<BR>
>Often men with frenulum breve consider it as "redundant foreskin" get circd and never learn the difference - so I appreciate your reminder to John.<BR>
>Humm - even though I dont ever advise doing it yourself - I must admit Im very happy for you and that my and Harmens pages were put to good use.<BR>
>How old are you? - did you have any experiences with intercourse or even condoms which I could use on the site? - eventually the medical profession must wake up!<BR>
>Thats all - stick around<BR>

>>I read your post on a very long foreskin with interest, as I have one too. I also found it hard to cum and had trouble wearing a condom. My glans was also always very moist and wet and irritated and itchy from the very long foreskin. I seen 4 doctors and all they wanted to do was circumcise me tight so my cock head was bared. I did not want this  done as I grow a lot when hard and if I was cut tight there would be no loose skin to expand when hard.<BR>
>>So several years ago I started searching the net on foreskins and found very little information apart from porn and pro cir sites. At last I found a site which is on here now about frenulum breve and thats what I had. I could pull my foreskin back with ease but it was anchored to the eye of my cock and when pulled back tight the eye of my cock would be pointing back down my shaft. I could only jack off with my foreskin over the cock head.<BR>
>>All the doctors could not tell me that, all they wanted to do circumcise me.<BR>
>>So I followed the instuctions on this site and tied my frenulum off with cotton which was not painful at all and after 6 days the cotten came off and my frenulum was cut and my foreskin for the first time went all the way back down the shaft. There was no bleeding no pain and no skin was removed and there is not even a scar to show where it was cut.<BR>
>>Now when I jack off, the foreskin is behing my glans, I have tried doing it with my cock head covered but after a few stokes my glans is always uncovered.<BR>
>>Sex is tenfold better as my foreskin is bared now when having sex. Also I no longer have a wet and irritated glans as my foreskin is now not been pulled foreward all the time by the frenulum. The foreskin has shortened to the stage that the eye of my cock is just showing when soft, where before I have over a inch of overhanging foreskin and that has now dried my glans out.<BR>
>>I think you will find that you have frenulum breve.<BR>

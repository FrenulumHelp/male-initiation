As an answer to: <A HREF="71.htm">Torn Frenulum</A> written by Megan at 26 Jun 2005 21:55:02:<P>

Hello Megan,<BR>
                    <BR>
Firstly I should say that I'm not a doctor. My experience in this subject stems from my own previous foreskin complaint and my interest in the subject generally is driven by my desire to raise awareness and promote education on the issues surrounding male foreskin complaints.<BR>
 <BR>
I am sorry to hear that your boyfriend has recently torn his frenulum. I am assuming that he has always suffered with a short frenulum (a condition called frenulum breve) and has probably experienced pain or discomfort previously during intercourse. So recently during sexual intercourse it finally ripped. Am I accurate so far?<BR>
 <BR>
I guess that it bled quite a lot and is now causing him some discomfort.<BR>
 <BR>
I will quote from a section of our site which gives an accurate description of the affects of this condition:<BR>
 <BR>
'Subsequently the bleeding will often congeal and the frenulum will rejoin which may make it even tighter and then it will subsequently rip again, so that the process continues ad infinitum. To add to the general frustration, occasionally an ulcer like scab can develop on the rip scar, and this may even break off when engaging in sex.' <BR>
'Whether it rips or not and if it rejoins certainly depends more on the thickness of the frenulum than its shortness. Some men have a thin frenulum breve which is typically topped with a string of skin like a hem while others have a thick sturdy frenulum. It appears that when a thick frenulum breve rips, it can rejoin, whereas a thin frenulum breve leaves such tiny flaps of skin that they can recede into the shaft skin beneath the glans. With a thin frenulum breve, once the string which forms the hem on the frenulum rips, the remaining frenulum will rip easily and naturally.'<P>
So you can see that it is dependent on the nature of his frenulum as to how it will heal. It is obviously much better if it does not rejoin and once the soreness has gone he may experience no further problems. However you should be aware of the possibility that it may rejoin and may be even tighter. If this is the case and ripping occurs frequently he may like to consider a frenuloplasty which is the recommended surgical technique to cure a short frenulum. See http://www.male-initiation.net/frenulum_treatment.html#start for information on the operation. It is a quick and simple process, far more so than a circumcision.<P>
Providing he does not bleed profusely or is in exceptional discomfort the frenulum usually heals up itself pretty well. Hopefully he will be better off once it has healed and may not experience any further problems.<P>
If you need any more advice please feel free to contact me again.<P>
<BR>

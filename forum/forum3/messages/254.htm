As an answer to: <A HREF="252.htm">Re: i have frenulum breve</A> written by tac at 13 Feb 2006 18:53:32:<P>

>ok, any tips on how to stretch it properly?<P>
Hi tac,<P>
I enclose a few notes from other letters, please understand this is an experiment and if it doesnt work within two weeks then we will be back to square one, and the inevitable chat with parents etc. etc. ... (note that talking to your parents about this isnt half as bad as it sounds, particularly if you have all the research at hand and can tell them what you want ie. a frenuloplasty) <P>
To stretch in a controlled and scientific fashion it is fairly important to fill out the questionnaire <BR>
www.male-initiation.net/frenulum_research.html<BR>
It is important for me to know some questions particularly about how many blood vessels (veins and arteries) you have running through your frenulum, how thick the frenulum is, and if it is topped by a string. If you could answer these questions it will be far easier for me to give specific advice. It would also be a way for you to further inform yourself on frenulums in general, I feel this is essential before you start experimenting.<P>
Stimulating a controlled rip is a "danger" or a "blessing" depending on how much blood loss there is, and with a thick frenulum with the frenular artery running through it, blood loss can be scary.<P>
So, I think Ive said everything I can at this stage - - and I only warn to be careful, cool calm, and use your intelligence etc.<P>
and tell us what happens<P>
Cheers<P>
Robin<P>
a few notes on Stretching the Frenulum<P>
The first possibility is that the frenulum might stretch. I have no<BR>
bona fida reports that it has ever worked ... but it is theoretically<BR>
possible, because skin stretches, ... we would need a two week<BR>
experiment with at least 10 mins a day to find out if this could work<BR>
for you ... we would need to plan it, you would need to fill out the<BR>
questionnaire to do it scientifically. <P>
<BR>
Testing this would only be intelligent for someone with a mild degree<BR>
of brevity, no blood vessels running through it, and a frenulum which<BR>
was not hemmed or topped with a string.<P>
steroids would thin the frenulum skin to help stretching<P>
The only validated reports I have heard are that stretching the<BR>
frenulum always rips it. However this could be explained with the idea<BR>
that it is a sudden stretch which causes ripping. A gentle regular<BR>
stretching is necessary.<P>
(Maybe pulling suddenly could be used to initiate a controlled rip?)<P>
The more often and the more gentle you are the more effect this has<BR>
when stretching skin. Repeatedly rhymically tensing and flexing is<BR>
more effective than holding a stretch under tension.<P>
The main problem as I see it is stretching/putting the frenulum under<BR>
tension is painful - so can you discover a way to stretch without<BR>
pain?, maybe even with a little pleasure ...<BR>

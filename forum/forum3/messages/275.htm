As an answer to: <A HREF="274.htm">torn frenulum - looking for best solution</A> written by Lucas at 02 Mar 2006 20:25:28:<P>

Dear Lucas,<P>
Fascinating letter.<P>
Lets start by thanking you for writing to arc ... and actually at<BR>
present this gets forwarded to only me, and then if youve read my<BR>
little note about only being online once a week, and if you were<BR>
trying to avoid a delay in answering then bad luck ... yours truly<BR>
always takes a week or two ...<P>
So your frenulum previously must have been on the short side to have<BR>
created such pleasant sensations when under tension. You say it ripped<BR>
due to an accident, a mistake, it is always nice to know the details,<BR>
but I'll save you the embarrassment, whatever, you now have the<BR>
symptoms of frenulum breve.<P>
Yes this can repeat, frenulums which have ripped once have a habit of<BR>
re-ripping. Also youre asking about when youre 40 and the lack of<BR>
lubrication, well if I project till you are 70 I could almost<BR>
guarantee extra problems due to general skin shrinkage.<P>
Calendula salve is interesting, I know nothing of herbal cures, is<BR>
calendula the best plant to heal bleeding, or heal skin? ... if you<BR>
could confirm this simple question Id appreciate it - it might be<BR>
useful advice for others. What you probably should have done was to<BR>
apply the calendula and then bandaged the foreskin in a retracted<BR>
position so that the frenulum could mend in its new ripped length, it<BR>
sounds like you (and most others) packed it tight together and so it<BR>
has joined and healed shorter than previously.<P>
I dont follow how the frenulum is thicker than before, whereas I can<BR>
follow how the remnants of the scar from rejoining would be thicker<BR>
than it was before.<P>
What is fascinating is frenulum tension is sonetimes reported as<BR>
pleasant, often painful - I have often wondered if this is due to<BR>
where and how it is attatched to the foreskin, however your experience<BR>
shows quite clearly that the difference in sensation is purely due to<BR>
difference in length, this is really very curious because then surely,<BR>
by pulling back less you should arrive at the same sensation you had<BR>
before ... nerves must run through the frenulum and you must have<BR>
ripped them as well ...<P>
My subjective experience is indeed that after frenuloplasty the<BR>
foreskin underneath hangs further forward, ... something like this<BR>
must have happened, but I never took scientific measurements, so maybe<BR>
it just allowed a bag to form and hang under the glans which collected<BR>
the urine. (I had only 5 yrs. with frenuloplasty before having a half<BR>
circ. so I can only rely on my memory)<P>
I can only imagine and speculate that whereas my frenulum breve<BR>
attatched the foreskin to a point underneath the glans, with you it is<BR>
attatched nearer the meatus (the urinary opening) and thus pulls the<BR>
foreskin further forward ... or maybe your glans has another shape ...<BR>
my speculation is that if you had a frenuloplasty your foreskin would<BR>
sit further back, maybe in its original position.<P>
Of course your optimal operation would somehow simply return the<BR>
frenulum to its original length ... (is this possible with money and<BR>
plastic surgery?)<P>
What I can say and have heard repeated often enough, is when the<BR>
frenulum is removed (frenuloplasty sews it into the shaft of the<BR>
penis) the area where the frenulum was is then pleasurable to touch<BR>
etc. .. I would say the most pleasurable area on the entire penis.<P>
So, actually if youve lots of cash and feel like being a scientific<BR>
experiment then ARC will be extremely interested if it is possible to<BR>
actually extend a frenulum breve to a pleasurable length. However by<BR>
far the easiest most practical thing to do is to have a frenuloplasty.<BR>
The alternative is to live quite unworried until it rips again, if and<BR>
when this happens apply your calendula and bandage the foreskin back,<BR>
so that it heals in the ripped position. The problem with this method<BR>
is stilling the blood, and the amount of blood depends on how thick<BR>
the blood vessels in your frenulum are. Anyway, it would mean you need<BR>
to have plenty of swabs available, I suppose tampons would also do ...<P>
If there is an uneven overhang after a frenulum op. it would be<BR>
comparatively easy to cut this straight as a second step. For me its a<BR>
very interesting question, I dont really understand why your foreskin<BR>
hangs longer when the frenulum is shorter, whereas mine did the<BR>
opposite, ... so the bounds of my understanding are being stretched<BR>
and for this reason thank you for your letter, very informative.<P>
Keep in touch tell us what happens,<BR>
Cheers<P>
Robin<P>

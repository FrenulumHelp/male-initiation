As an answer to: <A HREF="223.htm">Re: stretched by dad</A> written by Rob at 26 Jan 2006 23:16:55:<P>

i have understood that you want some italian pages about foreskin gym translated for your site, but i'm wrong! maybe you asked me to translate your site in italian.<BR>
Yes, Italy need for information about phimosis, but i don't think that i'm good enough for translate it!<BR>
yes, you are again right, the web is too speed and i have replay without attention... i'm sorry for misunderstanding but i don't belived my eyes when i've found someone with i can talk about my childhood!<BR>
i hope to see you next week!<P>
<P>

>Hi,<BR>
>now you are very quick in answering, and I am only online once a week and this is my last letter before I go home.<BR>
>I dont really understand what you are offering here, I do not need an English translation of preputial gymnastics, it sounds like there is far too much of this  form of "American Football" already in the world.<BR>
>Also Bible sites arent exactly my cup of tea.<BR>
>However I did feel that maybe in Italy there was a need for the information on my site ... yes of course this is only my opinion ... however it might be your opinion as well.<BR>
>Whatever, please now, just think for a few days, and then give me an email which I can pick up next week - <BR>
>its true - I am fighting a loosing battle against the speed of internet - but I live in rather primitive conditions in the middle of a field and there is just no way to speed me up - (though thanks for trying).<BR>

>>Hi Robin!<BR>
>>i'm happy to translate for you same italian page about this "ginnastica prepuziale".<BR>
>>there is two different way of thinking: the old pediatric are pro foreskin gym (my doctor was very old 10 yers ago), the new pediatric are absolutely against.<BR>
>>On the web therisn't so much, if you search "prepuzio" on google you can find a lot of bible site but few medical... <BR>
>>the most of site about foreskin gym are parents forum, but i will search something for your site! :)<BR>

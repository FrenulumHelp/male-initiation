Hi Robin, Thanks for the reply.<P>
I have read through the site just as you asked and to be honest, I am feeling a little more confident of my situation. It is true that I was almost convinced to stay away from any circumcition procedures by anti-circumcition sites but not anymore. Now I am considering undergoing the procedure. I do have a couple more questions however about the circumcition procedure and healing time. <BR>
From your knowledge, How much pain is involved in the process? Is there really a loss of sexual sensation after circumcition? And finally, The glans are very sensitive and I feel pain when I touch them, how can I treat this?<BR>
Thank you<BR>

>Hello Shawn,<BR>
>Firstly, it is important to realise that very many men have phimosis. Or would you call 10% seldom? ... You have been reading too much biased literature. Unfortunately the anti-circumcision movement use statistics from only one study which gives statistics as the result of 7 years stretching and education - it is really quite ridiculous, but fanatics usually are!<BR>
>Rest assured that phimosis is occurring in 10% of young men - my refs. are at least 5 medical studies: Schoeberlein Saitmacher Osmond Beauge Parkash and others. So please dont feel like a rarity, this is exactly what the anti circumcision movement wants you to believe.<BR>
>I doubt very much if the anaesthetists would do their job so badly that you would wake up during an operation ... just think there are people going in for heart surgery etc. ... (is this another part of the biased rubbish you have been reading?)<BR>
>Please do not forcefully retract - this could cause paraphimosis, but force is quite useless when stretching a phimotic ring.<BR>
>Really you seem to have picked up all your info. at some anti circ. site and then come here with crazy scare stories and no clue on realities. Have you never heard of stretching?<BR>
>Have you read anything on my site?<BR>
>There are a number of options to cure phimosis without full circumcision, the first option you should attempt is probably stretching, however this will only work if yours is a primary phimotic ring (ie from birth).<BR>
>Please would you educate yourself on a bit of unbiased information and simply read www.male-initiation.net/phimosis_treatment.html  you will probably need the sections on stretching and steroids - however I would be happy if you would simply read this page and then ask more questions.<BR>
>Cheers<BR>

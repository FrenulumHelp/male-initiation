As an answer to: <A HREF="122.htm">Re: Doubts on diagnosis</A> written by Robin at 26 Oct 2005 19:25:15:<P>

HEy! Thanks very much for your reply! Don't worry about how long it took, I <BR>
know this is voluntary work! The truth is that I was a Greek God at one <BR>
point, but I fell from mount Olympus , cursed by Zeus! And the curse was to <BR>
have foreskin problems!!! If i still was a god, I would blow all the <BR>
problems away and give myself a few "extras"! Oh, and the word phimosis (or <BR>
fimosi as it's pronounced in Greek) is a modern Greek word. It comes from <BR>
the word fimono which means to gag or to choke or to trap someone's mouth <BR>
(muzzle) not to speak (fimotro is the word for the muzzle used for dogs for <BR>
example). Actually a huge percentage of medical (and generally scientific) <BR>
terminology is Greek! (that's very good for me!).<P>
So more or less the doctor says the same thing as you, that what's left <BR>
where the frenulum was is just scar tissue, and doesn't need removing <BR>
(actually he said it's not possible, which I think isn't true). The problem <BR>
is that he cannot see the erect state to understand my point. So I've <BR>
attached some pictures in the erect state (not very good quality, from a <BR>
mobile phone!) to maybe help my description. My main concern is the feeling <BR>
I have that a full erection isn't being allowed by the remaining frenulum - <BR>
so neither the full length or hardness of a normal erection are reached. <BR>
Also I do really want a folding back foreskin, maybe not totally evenly , <BR>
but - as you can see in the pictures - it doesn't unfold almost at all!<P>
There is also this web-page which I found very helpful that shows the <BR>
result after a frenuloplasty without a circumcision. You can see that his <BR>
foreskin unfolds evenly , which is what I was hoping for. Here is a link : <BR>
http://home.zonnet.nl/harmen55/frenuloplasty.html. He had done it by "tying <BR>
up" as he calls it. It seems that the old method was much more effective <BR>
than the super-scientific laser method...! The only difference with the <BR>
laser is that for the frenulum you need no stiches, and no antiseptic <BR>
precautions during the operation - because the laser automatically closes <BR>
up the cut it opens. Also it does the least possible damage to the <BR>
sensitive nerves of the area, because it's the most precise incision you <BR>
can get.<P>
My main clue that something more needs to be done is the way the glans gets <BR>
bent down when I pull the foreskin back . You can see that clearly in the <BR>
side pictures. Even when I slightly unfold the foreskin by pulling it back <BR>
, it immediately pulls the glans downwards. There is no real problem as in <BR>
pain or using condoms. The only problem , which I think is serious , is the <BR>
not very hard erections.Tell me what you think, I would really appreciate <BR>
your help, and hope the pictures make things clear. Thanks again for your <BR>
time and energy, hope all is well!<P>
Cheers, Irwan.

Hi Leslie,<P>
Why did the skin bridge happen? <P>
If the infant epithelial adhesions are separated and the fresh sticky skin surfaces are allowed to rest in contact with each other again, they can fuse together causing small connecting strings or bands of skin tissue between the foreskin and the glans<P>
please see <A HREF="../../../skinbridges.html">www.male-initiation.net/skinbridges.html</A> for more information<P>
will it come back? and did you do something wrong?<P>
no and no!<P>
The operating doctor was not very careful and there was no after care for the operation, such expertise is unfortunately all very normal for routine infant circumcisions in the USA<P>
-------------<P>
If he has still a lot of foreskin left on his penis, then this could be a good thing. If later in life he wants a full circumcision then in the USA he will easily be able to have one.<P>
(I somehow presume that your story comes from the USA?)<P>
I must admit it is the first time I have heard of a penis being "chunky" - do both doctors know each other? - I dont know, Im afarid since Ive been working on this theme, my respect for doctors opinions has become somewhat blemished, and when this combines with a professional bedside manner, then it seems they are capable of uttering all sorts of nonsense to appease their patients ... so thats just my opinion on "chunkyness".<P>
Whatever; the operation to divide skin bridges is the absolute simplest in the book, I can give a 100% guarantee that unless the surgeon is a one eyed, nervous jerk who just had a row with his wife etc etc then it will be no problem and cured in 3 weeks time.<P>
cheers<P>

>Hi. My 18 month old son is going to have a skin bridge removed from his penis. I have noticed this from day one after his circumscion. His dr kept saying it was a adhesion and it will go away on its own. Well i took him to a specialists and now he has to have surgery in 2 weeks. I was wondering why this happen? Also can it come back? Did i do something wrong? He also has a lot of skin left on the penis. I have to pull it down and clean it. Is this normal? Both doctors said it is because he was chunky. Thanks and i hope you have some answers for me.<BR>

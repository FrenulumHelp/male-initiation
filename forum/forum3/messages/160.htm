Blimey a mathematician,<P>
I could set you going on Osters statistics if you want a challenge. (it would take several hours work)<P>
I had someone else complain about this 10% a year ago, and I thought Id clarified it - so now clever cloggs how about just telling me how I should phrase it to make everyone happy :):)<P>
"It is often argued that UTIs (Urinary Tract Infections) happen 10% more in uncircumcised boys. What does 10% more mean?<BR>
Are we talking about 10% more than 1 in 6; or 10% more than 1 in 60,000? What does "10% more" actually mean in terms of how often problems of this sort are occurring?"<P>
I suppose thats my present suggestion and let everyone work out their own fractions and multiplications.<P>
Thanks<P>

>1 in 10 is 10% more than 1 in 100 on the other hand 1 in 6.000 is 10% more than 1 in 60,000. - What does "10% more" actually mean in terms of how often problems of this sort are occurring?"<BR>
>Your maths is wrong.  1 in 10 is the same as saying 10 in 100, which is really 900% more than 1 in 100.  10% more than 1 in 100 is 1.1 in 100, or 11 in 1,000.  The point your making is still right but you're using the wrong figures to make it.<BR>

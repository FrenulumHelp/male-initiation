For the past several months I have been experiencing a problem that has only gotten worse as time progresses. My experience as an uncircumcised male is that after intercourse, the next day I would find my penis to be in pain. The pain and swelling would subside in a few days. However now I find that my foreskin has become extremely tight. I have trouble retracting whether I'm flaccid or erect. It has become so painful when I'm erect that I have not been able to have intercourse for a couple of months. The head of my penis would be red and sore but eventually subside, but the tightness becomes progressivley worse. I went to see a doctor about it and I could hardly retract at all. He told me to soak my penis in warm salt water and prescribed a "MUPIROCIN" ointment. This creme would make the redness go away and I would be able to retract when flaccid. However when I'm erect my foreskin no longer retracts on its own. If i retract it myself it becomes very painful. I tried to have intercourse and I saw stars. The worse thing is that I notice small tears or cuts at the end of my foreskin. Sometimes its 1 or 2 . Sometimes its like 8 small cuts. Someone please help. The doctor told me I would have to be circumcied. I really don't want it to be done. Has anyone on this site experience what I'm talking about. Please reply because I need help.

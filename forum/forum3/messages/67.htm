Hello Again,<BR>
                   <BR>
There is little information or consensus of opinion on the nature of the phimotic ring. A point I forgot to mention in my previous E-mail is that a phimotic ring which develops as the result of an infection is usually a lichenoid type ring and these are atrophic (degenerative) unlike the congenital phimotic ring. It is for this reason that stretching does not work on that type of phimotic ring. The hypothesis of 'dead skin cells' comes from a number of sources which have been included in the research carried out by Robin Stuart (the site author) and specifically I can draw your attention to a study in the British Journal of Urology published in 1996 by J.R Taylor. He wished to show the nature and value of a normal foreskin and in achieving that aim he examined the foreskins of some 21 or 22 corpses. He described a ridged band which is identical to the band we recognise as phimosis, present in all of the corpses. This opens up the question, When rigor mortis sets in do all males develop phimosis? I will leave you to think about that. <BR>
 <BR>
Additionally it is clear that the band seen around the foreskin in phimosis sufferers differs from the healthy skin and it's rigidity and hardness certainly suggests that the cells are no longer functioning.<BR>
 <BR>
You are correct in stating that most babies are born with retraction problems and in most cases this is caused by adhesions which nearly always free themselves in the very early stages of childhood. It is because of these adhesions that phimosis often goes unrecognised by parents and doctors. Parents are often advised not to forcibly free the adhesions for fear of hurting the infant and I suggest that many parents simply leave their children alone at this point. Unfortunately those who do have phimosis often go undiagnosed for many years. <BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
Non-retractability of the foreskin is the effect of phimosis not the cause. The cause is most definitely the presence of a phimotic ring and this is supported by the compilation of medical studies which was carried out by Robin Stuart.<BR>
 <BR>
In answer to your question, I wonder if I have frenulum breve?'. You have not given me any real cause to believe you are suffering with frenulum breve as well. Firstly you comment that you experience no pain and are able to enjoy a full sex life and secondly you have not indicated any bleeding or springing forward of the foreskin when you try to retract. Check out http://www.male-initiation.net/diagnosis.html#start for more advice on how to self-diagnose.<BR>
 <BR>
Besides the cream you need patience and persistence. You should try stretching twice a day for a couple of months before judging the results. The technique for stretching should simply involve applying the cream and gently retracting your foreskin as far as you can numerous times right to the point where the foreskin can retract no further. I don't think you would have any success hands free, your hands are important because they can quickly pull the foreskin back forward again if you experience any discomfort. <BR>
 <BR>
Good luck<BR>

Hi Robin,<P>
I'm glad you site is here as a resource for circumcision related <BR>
operations.  Thanks!  I'm here to ask what you know about <BR>
frenuloplasty.  I'll fill you in on some of my story....<P>
About six months ago I finally realized I had phimosis thanks to some<BR>
internet searches.  I found stretching exercises and proceeded to do<BR>
them.  Due to high school sports and a packed schedule I was not able<BR>
to do them consistently.  Obvioulsy, I did not see results.  In the <BR>
past two months, however, I have done the stretching exercises <BR>
consistently every day.  It has worked to an extent.  Whereas I could<BR>
barely see my glans before with much effort, I can now get about one<BR>
fourth of the way down.  One month ago I noticed that my results had<BR>
halted due to a short frenulum.  So on another forum I was recommended<BR>
other stretches for my frenulum.  One month later and nothing has <BR>
changed.  This is why I am looking into a frenuloplasty.<P>
Any information you could provide on this subject would be greatly <BR>
appreciated.  I'm not even exactly sure how the operation works.  Does<BR>
you foreskin already need to retract a certain amount for doctors to<BR>
perform the operation?  Does it separate the frenulum or simply <BR>
lengthen it?  Do you think this operation could yield the results I'm<BR>
looking for?  I would like to see full retraction eventually.  I <BR>
believe afterwards I could successfully stretch the remaining foreskin<BR>
back as long as my frenulum is long enough.<P>
Once again thank you!  I have posted about this topic many times in <BR>
other forums.  Most times they refuse to talk about operations and <BR>
simply recommend I do more stretching.  I believe stretching can work<BR>
for some people and in certain situations, and I have tried it with <BR>
some results.  However, I am not prepared to stretch for the next two<BR>
years to be able to function normally.  At some point, other options<BR>
should be considered.  The more knowledge you have, the more qualified<BR>
you are to make a decision (especially when dealing with you manhood).<BR>
Thank you in advance.<P>
Max

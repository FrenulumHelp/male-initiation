Hi DR,<BR>
         <P>
Thank you for your E-mail. I did find it somewhat hard to understand but hope I dissected the important parts. I gather that you have recently torn your frenulum and would like information on the likelihood of it happening again and how you might prevent a future rip occurring. The truth is that the likelihood of it ripping again largely depends on how the frenulum has healed and how thick it is. I will now quote from our site: <P>
‘Sometimes it rips on the first sexual encounter often later. When the frenulum rips, this may save years of adult problems.’<P>
‘Subsequently the bleeding will often congeal and the frenulum will rejoin which may make it even tighter and then it will subsequently rip again, so that the process continues ad infinitum. To add to the general frustration, occasionally an ulcer like scab can develop on the rip scar, and this may even break off when engaging in sex.’ <P>
‘Whether it rips or not and if it rejoins certainly depends more on the thickness of the frenulum than its shortness. Some men have a thin frenulum breve, which is typically topped with a string of skin like a hem while others have a thick sturdy frenulum. It appears that when a thick frenulum breve rips, it can rejoin, whereas a thin frenulum breve leaves such tiny flaps of skin that they can recede into the shaft skin beneath the glans. With a thin frenulum breve, once the string which forms the hem on the frenulum rips, the remaining frenulum will rip easily and naturally.’<P>
You indicate that your frenulum appears thin which may well be good news. It is entirely possible that you will experience no further problems. However if the rip does rejoin and becomes even tighter the best and only option in my opinion is to have a frenuloplasty carried out. This is a very simple procedure carried out by a surgeon for which you would need little or no recovery time other than to get the anaesthetic out of your system. This is literally an in and out within the day job with little pain to speak of.<P>
I hear your reluctance to have any surgery and for your sake I hope your frenulum does not rejoin. I am not aware of any success of stretching a frenulum although this does not mean it is impossible. Others on this forum may wish to add comment on this issue.<P>
I hope this has helped.<P>
Nick<P>

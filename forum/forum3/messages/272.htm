<BR>
Hello, I am 20 yrs old and only recently found out that I have Phimosis.<BR>
Needless to say its quite an emotional and psycological shock, I had no Idea<BR>
that I was abnormal, and I feel stupid and ashamed.  I greatly appriciate<BR>
your site, knowing that i am not alone in this perdiciment is somehow<BR>
reassuring.   I grew up in on a farm in a very rural area in Canada with 4<BR>
sisters and my mother.  Being the only Male in the family, The organ in<BR>
question was never disscused, leaving me to find out about even simple<BR>
things such as cleaning on my own.  This lead to a number of painful<BR>
infections as a child, which also were never disscused.  As the oldest, and<BR>
only male, I took on much of the farm work from an early age, and simply the<BR>
time invested meant that I and never developed any friendships, or explored<BR>
very much social contacts ( and thus had nothing to compare myself to, or<BR>
ask questions of) .  I am now in first year at University and only now have<BR>
learned of my condition.  I think among the contributing factors to my<BR>
condition would be a absence of correct mastrubation techniques as I was<BR>
discouraged from doing so as a child, I always felt guilty and never<BR>
actually manually did so ( I would only wake up in the morning and stroke<BR>
through the sheets, never to the point of ejaculation).  I would appriciate<BR>
any comments about treatment, or about dealing with the emotional feeling of<BR>
being very lonely and socially isolated.  I would also like to extend my<BR>
support to your website and encourage real education about male sexual<BR>
issues in grade school and at home, as this would likely have prevented my<BR>
current situation.<BR>
Thank you

<BR>

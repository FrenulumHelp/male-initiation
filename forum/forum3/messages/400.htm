As an answer to: <A HREF="397.htm">Frenulum Operation</A> written by Y at 21 Jul 2006 03:28:38:<P>

Hello Y,<P>
<A HREF="../../../frenulum/frenuloplasty/frenulum.html">pictures of frenuloplasty before and after the operation</A><P>
I think its very early days to judge how your penis will look after the operation. Give it a couple of weeks.<P>
Shame you didnt look round my site a bit more and found the tying method with frenulum ... leaves no scars ... Whatever, no worry, any form of frenuloplasty is a competent operation, I have never heard complaints from anyone - (except one with a laser operation).<P>
If you have had frenulum breve since childhood and are now 45 I imagine this has influenced your sex life to some extent. Once you have your personal problem resolved, I (and numerous children who are now growing up with this condition) would appreciate your contribution to this site, in the form of a description of the difficulties you have had. <P>
It seems to me the medical profession have no full appreciation of the potential sexual problems involved with this condition, and by documenting these problems I hope the medical profesion will wake up to the necessity to check and treat boys before puberty. Your contribution would be appreciated.<P>
Cheers<P>

>I just wanted to ask a question or two about my recent op. I am 45 yrs old and have experienced frenulum breve (I now realise thansk to your web site and a few others) since childhood.  I finally took the plunge and had the operation this week.  My Frenulum was attached to the glans at a very high point. Anyway, the urologist has performed the operation (took 20 minues) and I have had the dressing off for one day now. I had the Op five days ago.  The shaft is still quite swolen but the glans seems almost fine except for a pretty long scar tat is stitched closely. I am concerned about the stitching as it is rather untidy and has left a very small knob of tissue at the top of my glans.  I am hoping this will retract and smooth out after a while and when the stitches dissolve.  If it does not I am concerned about the aesthetics. The stitching on the shaft seems fine if maybe a little tight. This tightness also concerns me slightly.  To get to my point. I have never seen any pictuires of the results of the operation taken shortly after the Op.  I have never seen pictures of the head of the glans showing the resulting scar.  In summary I wonder if the results of operation I have had are the best they can be.  I may be getting unduly worried over nothing and need to be patient.  Any help with my anxiety would be most welcome.  I will be calling the Urologist today to ask him about my concerns and will return next week for a check up.  Thanks in Advance.<BR>

Hi Nick<P>
Thanks again for your detailed reply.<P>

It seems you are using "phimosis" identically with "the presence of a<BR>
phimotic ring", which means that adhesions do not count as phimosis.<BR>
Some authors, OTOH, define phimosis as non-retractability, regardless<BR>
of the cause. (e.g. male-initiation.net says "Phimosis indicates the<BR>
inability to freely retract the foreskin.").<P>

Thanks for the reference!<BR>
I also wonder if this could related to having a higher concentration<BR>
of sebaceous bubbles (cysts?) in the phimotic area than elsewhere.<BR>
(could the white stuff just be really small cysts?)<P>

I'Il wonder how difficult it would be to find this out. I imagine one<BR>
could just look at these cells in a microscope. I'll ask my biologist<BR>
friends.<P>

Well, when I have sex, my glans is fully (or almost fully) covered.<BR>
Also, if I have erections while retracted, they are painful (but<BR>
completely avoidable): my frenulum is clearly under pressure to<BR>
stretch and it turns white.<P>
It looks a bit like pictures #4 and #5 from<BR>
http://home.versatel.nl/harmen55/frenpics.html .<P>
<BR>
> and secondly you have not indicated any bleeding or springing forward of the foreskin when you try to retract. <P>
Springing forward will happen if the foreskin is not trapped behind<BR>
the glans, but I thought this was natural. In any case, I only retract<BR>
for the purposes of cleaning.<P>
<BR>

My concern is that this could bruise the glans. Maybe I should never<BR>
do this erect. I am not very patient, unfortunately.<P>
There has been a study claiming successful treatment of boys with a<BR>
balloon catheter.<BR>
( http://www.cirp.org/library/treatment/phimosis/he-zhou/ ) I wonder<BR>
if it could work on adults.<P>

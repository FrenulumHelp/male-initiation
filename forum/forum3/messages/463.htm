<br>
 Dear Sirs :<p>
 I felt an enormous relief of chronical suffering being <br>
circumcised at 19 years old. I was never regreted on do it, in every sense.<br>
 During all my teenage years, from 13 to 19 years old, I had an<br>
uncircumcised penis, suffering of a chronical irritation on my head<br>
penis ( balanites ). I was only circumcised at the end of my<br>
adolescence.<br>
 Let me explain the whole torment of my teen years :<br>
 My suffering and the treatment was so bored  that my mother used to<br>
bath me till my 19 years old and when she coudn't do it, that job was<br>
done by an old maid servant, who was eventually my nanny.<br>
 I was not circumcised as a baby, because that is not a custom in my<br>
country and was not operated on my early teens, when all the trouble<br>
began, because my pediatrician, who was also a pediatric surgeon,<br>
thought that to achieve a perfect "low and tight" circumcision, taking<br>
off all the foreskin, mainly the inner skin, indispensable to cure my<br>
chronical balanites, it was necessary the full growth of the penis, on<br>
my 19 years old, as was done later.<br>
 Following the prescription of the doctor, she or the nanny, during<br>
the bathes, carefully washed my glans and the rolled up foreskin,<br>
using a kind of a bacteriologycal liquid soap, drying both with a<br>
towel, and just after rubbing both with an antibiotic pomade, in order<br>
to difficult the growth of microbes.<br>
 Those assisted bathes extended till I did my very tight<br>
circumcision, at my 19 and a half years old, which cured me completely<br>
just afterwards. My mother didn't have the necessary confidence on me<br>
to do that cleaning and treatment by myself. Any way, she, during all<br>
her life, was obsessed with cleaness.<br>
 Those bathes were taken together with a brother four years younger<br>
than me ( who suffered of that same balanites and was also circumcised<br>
and cured later, as me ), and a little sister, 8 years younger.<br>
 I had another sister, only 2 years younger than me, who never was<br>
bathed together with us, but by herself. It was established, I think,<br>
that she was a "young lady" and coudn't be bathed together with her<br>
"little siblings", even being myself 2 years older than her. We were<br>
treated as children and she as a young girl. I say that just to<br>
confirm the double standards of modesty concerning the nudity of boys<br>
and girls, not only in the United States, but in the whole world.<p>
B,

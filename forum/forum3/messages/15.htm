Hello<P>
I get time to answer this now, so I hope youre still there, <P>
You sem to have looked through my treatment pages, and the only options at present are using steroids to stretch the foreskin or an operation, here a partial circumcision is my recommendation. to find a doctor who can perform partial circumcision best idea is to find a Jewish doctor, check out my entry on ... , oh no I'll repost it here<P>
Cheers<BR>
Robin<P>
the ANSWER to partial circ.<P>
I love simple answers and here is one. wish Id have realised 6 years ago when I wanted a partial circ.<BR>
it must be right ... find a Jewish doctor.<P>
The doctors who are practised and perfected with partial circumcision are Jewish doctors. The Jewish circumcision is a partial circumcision. Its not only 8 day old children who are circumcised its every convert or intermarried adult. And they have simple (because 5000 yrs ago things were) and obviously tried and tested methods<P>
The only slight hesitation ... but I cant imagine that such a deep and thoughtful tradition would give a diferent cut to adults and infants (do we imagine a converted father with full circumcision and his son then being given the traditional partial ... such a question of identity is sure to have been considered by the Jewish tradition).<P>
There are even added advantages, .. you will certainly receive a respectful caring (even religious) attitude, possibly even with interest in sexual problems youve had ... <P>
Go to your local Jewish hospital - (cities often have one) - or you would need to get in touch with your local synagogue who Im sure would welcome the question, then this operation for the Jews is at the basis of the covenant with God, (the primary bond between the Jews and God, infact the bond which made them, as far as they were concerned, "Gods people")<P>
Please report the complete procedure on this forum and your success .... or failure<P>
So, again, thanks to Abraham <BR>

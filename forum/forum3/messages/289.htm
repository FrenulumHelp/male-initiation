Hi Robin, how are you? First i must say the site on phimosi is very helpful  and I am sure that many people have benefited from your work. I however seem to  of got completely lost in the understanding of all the possibilies of phimosis,  I understand this is due to the fact that no two people are the same and there  is no manual for the human body. I was wondering if we could correspond over  e-Mail for a while to see if you could help me further with dificulties.<BR>
From what i can gather, I have phimosis, for as long as i can remember I  have not been able to retrct my foreskin, for 20 years this was not a problem  becuase I didn't know i should be able to. About a year ago I went to the doctor  about it and we both decided that it was my frenulm, I had a operation to cut  the frenulm which helped a small amount. I can now retract my foreskin fully  when not erect, yet when erect, I cannot. Depending on how erectmy penis is, I  can retract the foreskin almost fully when I am just over semi erect, however i  would not want to ejaculate with it retrcted as it feels a little to tight. The  main problem is that when fully erect, I can uncomfortably retyract the foreskin  over the head of my penis, but no further, if I continually try I start to loose  my erection and then it starts to retract as I said before. The picture below  highly resmebles my situation, <P>
I have read many things about BXO, and "white phimotic rings", from what i  can tell my phimotic ring is of a differnet colour to the rest the surrounding  area, however I am not at all confident with a self diagnosis and would like to  refrain from seeing the doctor again. Also, while flacid the foreskin does seem  a little to long when compared with other pictures on the internet, this  includes falcid and erect, the foreskin when erect is nearly closed around the  head of the penis, but as I say does allow slight retraction, but not  enough.<BR>
 <BR>
I would be grateful of any feedback you could send me, and if your were  comfortable with it, I would be okay with sending you digital pictures of my  situation, (please do not take that the wrong way, and only as a suggestoin),  Thankyou for time and I will look forward to hearing from you, Jim.

As an answer to: <A HREF="272.htm">phimosis</A> written by Christian at 02 Mar 2006 20:22:37:<P>

<BR>
Hello Christian,<P>
Thanks for your letter. I do like getting to know something of the<BR>
life and feelings and the histoty of the phimosis, from people who<BR>
write to me, rather than just the practical questions, - so thank you.<P>
My main advice and first advice is to keep cool calm and collected - I<BR>
have this saying that losing your mind is far worse than losing your<BR>
genitals - It is also simply that "being a man" means to me<BR>
confronting these matters sensibly - every problem offers a method of<BR>
initiation - self initiation - its just a matter of dealing with it so<BR>
we turn the whole experience into a positive learning experience.<P>
There is also the practical point that I live in "the middle of a<BR>
field" am not online and I pick up email one week answer the next, so<BR>
you have around 6 days to consider your answers and you get a reply<BR>
from me once every two weeks ... so lets just go slowly and carefully.<P>
Now, we have at least two areas for thought, and Id like to cover the<BR>
practical first. What form of phimosis do you have? we need an<BR>
accurate diagnosis before we can think out an accurate treatment.<BR>
Phimosis could mean anything. Is the phimosis caused by a frenulum<BR>
breve or a phimotic ring or anything else? How far can you see beneath<BR>
your foreskin? ... Youve obviously read my site a bit, have you found<BR>
male-initiation.net/phimosis_summary.html this might give you the best<BR>
place to start diagnosing yourself.<P>
Then with a phimotic ring this can be a simple anatomical structure,<BR>
or it can be connected with infections, and I note you have had<BR>
infections, and such rings are difficult to stretch, and so maybe we<BR>
will need to consider surgery, and all the options you have here, ...<BR>
so I suspect you will need to give me a clue how you feel about<BR>
circumcision, partial circ.(ie. overhang removal), or dorsal slit or<BR>
preputial plasty (maybe the most expensive - whereas other methods<BR>
should be covered by normal health insurance).<P>
Ok. so lets move to emotional things. I dont think its helpful to see<BR>
yourself as abnormal. Yes, normally men dont have phimosis, but 10%<BR>
cant really be called abnormal, maybe we could just say you belong to<BR>
a minority. Apart from the medical statistical studies which I found<BR>
later, I was absolutely amazed when I started asking people who I knew<BR>
if they had heard of this problem, and I personally believe it is far<BR>
more than 10% who have this, ... it seems simply that no-one has<BR>
talked about it, until www happened ... for centuries men have been<BR>
alone on this question, without realising that their best friends<BR>
probably have the same problem!! it really is a taboo, quite<BR>
phenomenal when one considers how many men felt embarrassed and alone<BR>
in the 19th century and before ...<P>
I also know this feeling of being stupid, ashamed, - what I felt was<BR>
that I was a sort of cultural joke - everyone else knew that the<BR>
foreskin retracted, but no-one told me -<P>
I grew up in a normal situation, with a brother and a Dad, but still<BR>
the genitals were not discussed and still I didnt realise, - I believe<BR>
your background has little to do with your not realising. It is simply<BR>
that we get used to our intimate body without questioning or worrying,<BR>
and actually, this is a sign of a healthy upbringing.<P>
It does sound like you had a few special moral constraints, but I cant<BR>
judge if youre Mum is prudish etc. ... Hummm, I imagine your farm had<BR>
no livestock, or at least not horses and cows ... If you did have<BR>
livestock it might be questionable why you didnt realise from<BR>
comparison with them. Even so, when I saw pictures of the retracted<BR>
foreskin I simply believed such men were circumcised ...  we simply<BR>
believe we are normal and healthy without worrying or questioning -<BR>
otherwise we would grow up nervous wrecks.<P>
Have you found Beauge on my site?<BR>
(male-initiation.net/library/medicus/beauge.html) he describes the<BR>
different masturbation techniques used by men with phimosis, so you<BR>
are also not alone there. But masturbation is a secondary point, your<BR>
condition came first and this led to the masturbation technique, not<BR>
the other way round. ... Beauge also talks about guilt, but I think<BR>
very many normal boys feel guilt about masturbation, and Beauge didnt<BR>
make a comparative study.<P>
loneliness and social isolation are tricky questions - I actually envy<BR>
you having 4 sisters, you are used to female company, you shouldnt<BR>
have much problem feeling at home once you get through the initial<BR>
contact making process - If I imagine youre in a farming course<BR>
surrounded by men, then I suggest joining a dance or creative<BR>
listening evening class because they are full of women, and youre<BR>
probably a hunk of a farming-man and theyd love you.<P>
Thank you for your offer of support for my site, I dont know whether<BR>
to take this literally, but if you want to join ARC or be put on my<BR>
mailing list, I would suggest that first you just sort out your own<BR>
problem and then let it rest a bit and maybe in a while, you could do<BR>
what? who knows, theres lots of possibilities - can you speak French?<BR>
Im wanting a welcome page in french - Keeping the site and ideas<BR>
online is my main concern otherwise it will be just anti and pro<BR>
circumcision sites - still Im 53 at present and not intending kicking<BR>
the bucket for a few years yet, still when you are 40 and looking back<BR>
on life who knows? - still please just leave anything else till you<BR>
are free of worries.<P>
cheers<P>

>Hello, I am 20 yrs old and only recently found out that I have Phimosis.<BR>

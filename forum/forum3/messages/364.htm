Hi Peter,<P>
Im not a doctor. ... and you are not English - I guess French or Italian? - you make a brave attempt at my native language.<P>
The simplest cheapest quickest best method of frenulum removal appears to be tying it with a stitch - this method has only recently come to my attention and is now online at www.male-initiation.net/frenulum/frenuloplasty/frenulum_tying.html<BR>
I think you would be interested in this.<P>
Do you know any other methods which are simpler???<P>
I dont know what you mean by "their penises were all peeled" - however I get your general message, ... you want my opinion, well I can understand your wanting to remove the frenulum on your boys, very understandable, and wearing retracted is a healthy option - having the choice of retracted or covered is I think very good ...<P>
But personally I would not recommend any surgery unless it was necessary - and you really did it in a very organised fashion : all 3 at the same time - I suppose basicly though I can understand you, your attitude is to do this routinely, and I am concerned for the boys who need this and that they should be checked before puberty to find out if they need it. <P>
My concern is simply that boys must be routinely checked, this is the most important thing, I dont want every boy to be routinely frenulotomised<P>
what is "sineoquiotomy" I have heard the name a couple of times but dont understand it?<P>
thanks for the letter<P>

>Dr. Robin<BR>
>This page Web is excelente for parents and teenagers boys.<BR>
>Why you does not advice the frenulumtomy for uncut men. <BR>
>In my case, I'm very happy after this cut. There are modern methods for cutting, easy and fast, without pain, blood and sutures. <BR>
>With my own experience, I wanted that my sons were uncut, but that their penises were all peeled and cut their frenulums since their early years (In one medical sesion, the three boys, with a simple anesthesical injection,  were peeled, two with sineoquiotomy, and all their frenulums cut in more or less ten minutes for each one. They had ten, eigth and six years old))<BR>
>Today, they wear their foreskins always retracted as circuncised and their pe nises and their heads are very well development.<BR>

I think I have a pretty good understanding now. Thanks.<P>

I imagine it shouldn't be too hard to put a circumcised foreskin under<BR>
a microscope. They already collect baby foreskins for growing skin to<BR>
be used in grafts, but I don't know if it's possible to diagnose a<BR>
phimotic ring in a newborn's foreskin.<P>
   <BR>

I'm trying to remember, since I don't have many retracted erections.<BR>
Mostly the glans is higher than the shaft, in order to squeeze through<BR>
the phimotic ring.<BR>
But I think that it does bend forward a little.<P>
I just noticed that when I perform a retraction (soft), my corona<BR>
(lips) bends down and changes shape a bit. Does this indicate frenulum<BR>
breve? How long is a normal frenulum?<P>
<BR>

Indeed. But I think it's primarily the phimosis. Though it's hard to<BR>
tell whether the pain is coming from skin or from the shaft.<P>
As I said, my frenulum can turn white from being pulled really tight<BR>
(a full erection), but doesn't seem to hurt.<P>
<BR>

This is quite an insight. Is a normal frenulum never under pressure?<BR>
(It's surprising that my doctors never mentioned mentioned the frenulum)<P>
So it's yet another mystery... why are some people born this way?<BR>
Actually, I have to wonder why there is a frenulum at all.<P>
<BR>

It's good to know. I'm think I'm not going to stretch or operate for<BR>
now. If sex without a condom or lubrication hurts, then I'll consider<BR>
it when the time comes.<P>
<BR>
> Surely your penis is put under more pressure during<BR>

As I always use condoms, this is not the case. Since there is no<BR>
friction to pull my skin, it simply stays covered, and I have no<BR>
problems this way.<P>
<BR>

Not at all!<P>
   <BR>

How is the stretching performed? Is it not against the glans?<BR>
Inserting my finger seems like reasonable stretch. This is why I was<BR>
wondering if there were any artificial "fingers", possibly inflatable,<BR>
so that one doesn't have to buy a set of 10 fingers.<P>

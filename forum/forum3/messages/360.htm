>>Hi Robin,<BR>
>>I'm glad you site is here as a resource for circumcision related <BR>

>>frenuloplasty.  I'll fill you in on some of my story....<BR>
>>About six months ago I finally realized I had phimosis thanks to some<BR>
>>internet searches.  I found stretching exercises and proceeded to do<BR>
>>them.  Due to high school sports and a packed schedule I was not able<BR>
>>to do them consistently.  Obvioulsy, I did not see results.  In the <BR>
>>past two months, however, I have done the stretching exercises <BR>
>>consistently every day.  It has worked to an extent.  Whereas I could<BR>
>>barely see my glans before with much effort, I can now get about one<BR>
>>fourth of the way down.  One month ago I noticed that my results had<BR>
>>halted due to a short frenulum.  So on another forum I was recommended<BR>
>>other stretches for my frenulum.  One month later and nothing has <BR>
>>changed.  This is why I am looking into a frenuloplasty.<BR>
>>Any information you could provide on this subject would be greatly <BR>
>>appreciated.  I'm not even exactly sure how the operation works.  Does<BR>
>>you foreskin already need to retract a certain amount for doctors to<BR>
>>perform the operation?  Does it separate the frenulum or simply <BR>
>>lengthen it?  Do you think this operation could yield the results I'm<BR>
>>looking for?  I would like to see full retraction eventually.  I <BR>
>>believe afterwards I could successfully stretch the remaining foreskin<BR>
>>back as long as my frenulum is long enough.<BR>
>>Once again thank you!  I have posted about this topic many times in <BR>

Dear:<P>
The stretching of the frenulum does not work, I'experimented myself since my early puberty. My foreskin was easy and totaly peeled but the frenulum was some short. In a medical examination, the physician advice to my, the cut of the frenulum. In the same sesion, I was cut with electric scalpel. No more than ten minutes, without blood and pain. Today, I'm  happy with my penis. In erection, I's all peeled with its head right, so the coital penetration is very pleasure.  My sons are uncut, but they had frenuluctomy before their puberty years.  <P>
Sincerily, I advice you the cut of your frenulum. After twenty days, your sexual life will be more happy.

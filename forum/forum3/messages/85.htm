hi i am not going to leave my name on this page as i am an open person but <BR>
not in this situation so io shall leave my initials<BR>
so hi my name is DR and i have been reading you website and found it very <BR>
interesting and educational, i have have sexual intercourse now with two <BR>
woman and have had the same situation almost with both of them sexual <BR>
activities, my first i think the girl i had intercourse with wasnt very <BR>
experienced and let me do all the work but to spare you the details ill get <BR>
straight to the point after 20-30minutes i could feel my penis was sore and <BR>
thought nothing of this at that time. in this case i thought this might be <BR>
an out come of sexual intercourse as this was my first time, and for the <BR>
next 5 or six days there was visably signs of bruising which soon healed, <BR>
and again i thought nuthing of this and didnt evan try to reasearch the <BR>
problem, my next time was witha more expeirience woman and therefor allot <BR>
more went on and this time i could feel the tension, and didnt think that <BR>
what happend was right, as all of the other lads problems my frenulum tore <BR>
and at the time wasnt an think different than the tension i was feeling, in <BR>
this situation i didnt finish for a different reason on this tearing as i <BR>
didnt know it did until the next day, but to cut along story short it did <BR>
and i am very worried about this if it happens again from reading up on all <BR>
othe information i could find only this site had info on stretching it <BR>
yourself, and to me i was wundering if this would work, as from my previus <BR>
sexual encounter i am almost sure i can pull my foreskin back more and have <BR>
identified my frenulum as being thin i was wundering if you could email me <BR>
back on when you have found information on this and i would like you to know <BR>
that an operation of this kind would be simply out of the question, thank <BR>
you for your time i really do  apreciate it <P>
DR<P>
i would also like to say not to use my email address please as i would like <BR>
the most possible privacy on this thank you.<BR>
<BR>

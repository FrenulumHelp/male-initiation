Hi Robin,<P>
yes, i'm circumcised. I am not sure how i got it though. I  think that it was my parents fault for not taking care of it. For  awhile i thought it looked...different, but i wasn't really sure.. and i  was right.<BR>
 <BR>
yeah, i was already thinking that. Why didn't anyone know. I  have been to the docters plenty of times. And just about a year in half ago i  had a physical, and i was checked maybe for cancer, but i am not sure, and the  docter didn't say anything to me. Same with my parents, they should have  known..but instead i had to find out on my own. .<BR>
 <BR>
thanks for helping me.<P>

>>I am 15 years old and have just discovered that I have a  skin bridge. I am not sure on what to do. I have only told my two best friends.  I want to get it fixed, but i am too  embarrassed.<BR>

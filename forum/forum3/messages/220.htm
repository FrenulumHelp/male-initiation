As an answer to: <A HREF="219.htm">pain during intercourse</A> written by D at 26 Jan 2006 22:05:09:<P>

Hi, D.<BR>
You know on reading through this Im fairly sure you have a secondary phimosis caused by BXO, let me explain that slowly. BXO often called LSA and both sound even more horrible if I write them in full: Balanitis Xerotica Obliterans or Lichen Sclerosus et Atrophicus has led to the development of a phimotic ring or "secondary phimosis".<P>
It is partly the speed at which your foreskin is closing up, and partly the lesions you mention which are a typical indication of BXO ... do you have opaque ivory coloured patches on glans or inner foreskin? There is also a possibility that you have diabetes ... It would be really good to have a definate diagnosis, I can only guess that it is BXO. However, whatever is causing it, the phimotic ring is narrowing so quickly that I feel whatever the cause, you must have an operation to open up the foreskin area, and dry out any seeds of any infection. <P>
Circumcision is the normal recommendation, if you wanted to try getting a partial circumcision you would then need to wear the foreskin retracted to achieve a "drying out" literally starving of the infection (... sorry I cant quite remember if BXO is defined as a virus ...) You must decide which of these options you wish for.  <P>
I would suggest that you need this operation quickly and if you have a choice, find a surgeon (they are more practiced with ops than urologists) a surgeon who you like and can discuss this with ... <P>
very much good luck <P>
cheers<P>

>I am a 52 year old uncircumised male. I have been divorced for approximately 15 years and have not actively (frequently) engaged in intercourse during that time. I masturbate frequently for release. My foreskin has always been tight but until recently have been able to retract it completely for purposes of hygiene.<BR>
>Approximately two years ago I retract the foreskin during a shower and had great difficulty recovering it. I was cautious from that time on not to retract the foreskin. Over the past two years the foreskin has tightened and closed to less than an 1/2 inch opening. I have seen a doctor on only one occasion. He made no diagnosis, but recommended circumsion. This was over a year ago.<BR>
>The situation has progressed and at this time I have nearly full closure of foreskin and lesions. I experience great pain during urination and intercourse.<BR>
>I have no confirmation of my self-diagnosis, do not know if this is an STD and transmittable to my partner or what options I have for treatment. <BR>
>Your information is about all I know. Anymore information or recommendations would be appreciated. <BR>

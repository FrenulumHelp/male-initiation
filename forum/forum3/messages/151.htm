Hi JJ<P>
I dont know what 6 b4 means - ah six before - my god you gotta be clever in the modern world ..:)<P>
no six isnt really a confidence boosting number ... <P>
Ok so it sounds like the salty sweat is reacting with a sore part of the not completely mended frenulum, a small problem but I dont know how best to advise treating it.<P>
One point is that frenulums have a habit of repeatedly ripping and rejoining, leaving a scar which sometimes rejoins even shorter than before (b4) - and it also sounds as though you had no great blood loss when it ripped b4. So IF your frenulum ever rips again then one thing to do is apply sterile pads to still the bleeding and keep the foreskin retracted for a few days, so that the frenulum heals in the ripped position.<P>
Do you have any problems during sex, ie not masturbation where it is easy to keep the foreskin forward, but during intercourse.<P>
If you do then Id suggest a new urologist (far better would be a surgeon, they are the experts for cutting things - urologists are mostly concerned with internal organs) so a new surgeon and get the op. done.<P>
If its just an annoying little stinging, then maybe you need a dermatologist ( a skin specialist) to suggest some cream to heal up the sore part. <P>
These seem to be your alternatives<P>
cheers<P>

>i only have a small tear and it was caused about a year ago , i healed after about a month , but recently came back and now in summer when it get hot and i start 2 swaet it stings, iam unsure to wait and see if it heals again or just go for the operation. i dont really want the scar thats all and my urologists said he had done about 6 b4 but i wasnt really feeling the trust.<BR>

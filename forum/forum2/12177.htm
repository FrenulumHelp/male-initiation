I am so thankful I found this site.  And reading the thread written by EBT really hit home as it seemed to for a lot of others here.<P>
Well before I pose my question here is a little about me.  I am 24 now and similar to EBT I never realized I was different or something was wrong until my first sexual experience.  I had seen uncircumsized penis' before (gym, locker room etc) but never though much about it.  Kinda like some people are tall and others not, I just though their's was different than mine.<P>
Anyway so after realizing that I did some research and have what I believe to be phimosis and a short frenulum it has pretty much consumed me lately.  <P>
Anyways that briefly summarizes bringing me to this point (Again the thread by EBT could have been me he was talking about)  For those that are familiar I am able to retract when flacid with minimal discomfort and not at all when erect.  Also I recently noticed that, I think it is called my frenulum seem to be short so that even if I could retract it would not fully roll back.  <P>
So heres where I hope to get some advice.  Has anyone had similar cases and received treatment?  What was it?  HOW was it?  I am leaning towards requesting some sort of topical cream or at the most partial circumsision to free the ring and the frenulum.<P>
Also just some further history on the nervousness, I must say that my wife and I have just given birth to our first child and so I am so nervous that I something will go wrong.  Kinda that why fix what not's broken.  I have kinda adapted around my condition by it is by no means my ideal.<P>
thank you for your time and any advice.  <BR>

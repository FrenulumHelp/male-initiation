<B>PART IV - Destiny Came Knocking On My Door</B><P>
How do you describe <B>luck</B>? Maybe you're lucky when<BR>
you put some money on your favourite soccer team, and<BR>
they win. Maybe you're lucky when you win a lottery.<P>
Maybe you're lucky if you hear someone knocking on your door,<BR>
and it's <B>Denise Richards</B> telling you that her fortune teller<BR>
told her to go to <B>this particular address</B> and find the man of<BR>
her dreams there - and voila! that's why I'm here. <P>
What happened to me can be compared to the last one. It's<BR>
incredible. My operation was scheduled in December 2002, and<BR>
the hospital sent the notifying letter to me, BUT THE LETTER<BR>
DIDN'T SHOW UP. So <B>I MISSED the operation</B>. I called the hospital<BR>
in late december, only to find this out, and they sceduled a new one<BR>
on February 12th, 2003. <P>
But I was tired of waiting. And no way in hell would I be satisfied <BR>
with having an operation as a proper solution to my problem!<P>
So I started searching up and down on the Net, and voila! I came across<BR>
a man called <B>Jake Booth</B> (thank you, Jake!), who described how<BR>
he treated his tight foreskin problem <B>without any surgical intervention<BR>
whatsoever</B>. He <B>STRETCHED the foreskin</B> until it was <B>elastic</B> enough it could be retracted unproblematically.<P>
I tried this for myself for a week or so. There were no results. I tried again,<BR>
and after a while a could see <B>a small part of my glans</B> for the first time<BR>
in my entire life. After that, I stretched for a few more weeks, but without<BR>
any further progress. <P>
<B>I gave up</B>. <P>
But the day of the operation was approaching, and I became more and more<BR>
nervous. So <B>I HAD to try again</B>. This time I tried real hard, real long.<P>
And guess what - it worked. I never showed up for my operation. I'm insanely<BR>
glad I solved the problem myself the right way - that is, the right way<BR>
for ME. The operation would leave me with the unanswered question "what if other<BR>
guys have it better?".<P>
If you continue reading, I'll tell you exactly what I did to <B>cure phimosis</B> myself.

<B>PART II - And Then I Realised</B>.<P>
   September 9th, 2002, I was watching a program called<BR>
   "The Sex Sence" on Discovery, where they showed pictures <BR>
   of a male penis. Nothing extraordinary, really, I've seen it<BR>
   before, but my subconsciousness must have been aware of all<BR>
   my abnormalities I've had all my life at that time.<P>
   So I had a "cold shower" experience - an awakening. <B>Something was<BR>
   wrong</B>. I was 19. You may ask yourself: what about sex education at<BR>
   school? Personal sex experiences? Pornography? What took me so long<BR>
   to understand your penis was different?<P>
   My answer is this: I was stupid and naive. The sex education pictures<BR>
   were to a large degree DESCRIPTIONAL, NOT GRAPHIC. I remained a<BR>
   virgin until the age of 21. And I liked watching soft pornography, not<BR>
   hard pornography.<P>
   But wait until you hear this: I started searching the Medical Dictionary<BR>
   at home and the Web for what was wrong with me ("phimosis", "foreskin"<BR>
   and "glans" were not part of my vocabulary). Guess what I found out?<P>
   I "found out" that I was circumcised (in reality, having a tight foreskin<BR>
   is the <B>logical opposite</B> of being circumcised!!!). My reasoning was:<P>
   1) I feel very little when I masturbate. I read on numerous Internet sites<BR>
      that circumcised people have little sensation during sex.<P>
   2) I started to look closely at my classmates: I noticed that their<BR>
      dicks appeared to be slightly different from mine, they had<BR>
      a "fold", their foreskin looked thicker.<P>
   So, I came to the wrong/stupid/retarted conclusion that the "glans"<BR>
   is what I get the pleasure from - that is, the tip of my foreskin.<BR>
   And since I was "circumcised", an ADDITIONAL skin layer must have had<BR>
   been removed from atop the first one. That's why the penises of other<BR>
   guys looked thicker, they had an extra skin layer!<P>
   In the defence of your humble moron, I live in Europe. I've never seen<BR>
   a circed guy, so I didn't know what I was talking about. If I were <BR>
   circumcised, I would have been teased in the lockerroom. I never was,<BR>
   so I assumed the other guys were simply polite not to say anything<BR>
   to me or were afraid to admit they were looking at my genitalia!<P>
   Why on Earth would a person born in Europe, by European parents,<BR>
   be circumcised? Why would my parents do this to me and give all my<BR>
   abnormalities and poor sex sensation?<P>
   I started reading about circumcision on the Web,<BR>
   and found out that, among other things, it was a cure for<BR>
   phimosis. So, the word "phimosis" entered my vocabulary, not as <BR>
   something I have NOW, but as something I had BEFORE. "Phimosis"<BR>
   is why you circumcise people.<P>
   I never said anything to my parents. <P>
   I continued to be a moron until the autumn of 2002. And then I<BR>
   moved out, started to attend college and being independent, <BR>
   went to a General Physician( a woman ). Here's what happened.

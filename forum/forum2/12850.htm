<B>PART VI - I give up!</B><P>
Like I explained in the previous chapter, <B>reaching<BR>
goal v0.8 is crucial</B>. In fact, based upon anectodal evidence<BR>
of both MYSELF and at least <B>one other regular contributor</B><BR>
on this site, the people who have tried stretching phimosis and<BR>
gave up, <B>did so before reaching v0.8</B>. They couldn't get to that point where they could insert two or more fingers into the foreskin, pull it<BR>
away from the stomach and stretch <B>comfortably</B> from within for<BR>
<B>several hours</B>. <P>
Once you can get there, it's peace of cake! There will be <B>progress<BR>
after progress</B>, motivating you to continue all the way to the finish line.<P>
In the beginning, <B>I was NOT able to do that</B>. The only thing i could do<BR>
is to grip the tip of the foreskin at the edges and drag them away. Then<BR>
I would see a sort of <B>a black tunnel</B> leading to the glans (I didn't see<BR>
the glans itself). <P>
So, I thought to myself "I need to stretch this thing from the INSIDE, <BR>
but my fingers are too large". I searched for <B>tools I could use</B>, and<BR>
suddenly rememered that there existed very handy deviced called....<BR>
<B>Q-tips</B>!<P>
<B>Cheap, readily available</B> in almost every grocery store, and with a <BR>
protective layer of cotton covering the sharp end (in case something<BR>
goes wrong and you poke yourself in the glans), they were simply perfect!<P>
At the beginning, I only inserted two at a time an stretched for hours. <BR>
I came to realise that I desperately needed an extra pair of hand that could<BR>
operate a <B>THIRD Q-tip</B>. Two Q-tips aren't enough to create a "hole" in the <BR>
foreskin tunnel, so that the glans finally becomes visible. <P>
<B>Thought experiment</B>: take a small rubber band and insert two fingers into it. When you try to stretch, in the middle of the band there would be little space. Now try it with 3 or 4 fingers! You can now have a large opening!<P>
Fortunately, it IS possible to operate 3 Q-tips with just two hands. It's<BR>
way too difficult to describe it with words, so I won't do it. <P>
Besides, most phimosed people at the very least are able to at least do <BR>
SOMETHING - retract the foreskin <B>at least a little bit</B>, and certainly inserting a couple of fingers inside!<P>
Just remember, giving up is very easy, and all this takes time. Stretching<BR>
is something that takes <B>hours and months</B>, not <B>minutes and days</B>!<P>

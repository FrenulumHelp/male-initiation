<B>PART V - Stretch the bastard!</B><P>
There are a certain set of <B>goals</B> you must reach. It's far better<BR>
to start from the end than from the beginning. Here's what I'm<BR>
capable of doing NOW:<P>
I can <B>fully retract</B> the foreskin, even when I have an erection.<BR>
Retracting isn't painful. I masturbate by sliding the foreskin<BR>
over the glans, which is the <B>correct way</B>. I have much more sensation<BR>
than ever before when I masturbate, because now the glans is <B>really<BR>
stimulated</B>. I don't touch it with my fingers, although it is merely<BR>
unpleasant, not painful. <B>I have had condomless sex with my (ex)girlfriend</B><BR>
several times, and everything works OK. Sex feels good!<P>
So, this is the final goal, <B>goal v1.0</B><BR>
Before you can reach it, you need to have a foreskin which you can<BR>
fully retract when <B>placid</B>(opposite of erect). That is <B>goal v0.9</B><P>
If you have reached <B>goal v0.9</B>, all you have to do is to retract the foreskin <B>20-40 times every single time you pee</B>, and it will become more elastic as time passes by. It's <B>inevitable</B>. <P>
But those of you who have yet to reach <B>goal v0.9</B>, must first accomplish <BR>
<B>goal v0.8</B>. That means you should able to do the following:<P>
1) Grab hold of your foreskin with your fingers and do the opposite<BR>
   of retracting it - that is, <B>pulling it away</B> in the direction FROM<BR>
   your stomach. The foreskin will probably try to slip and in it would<BR>
   be hard to grip it. <P>
2) Slowly <B>insert two or more fingers</B> into the foreskin, feel your way to<BR>
   <B>the tight area</B> of the foreskin and put some force on it, that is,         expand it from the inside using the fingers. <P>
For this to have the desired effect of reaching <B>goal v0.9</B>, it must be<BR>
repeated almost every day, and you should do it for a VERY long time at<BR>
a time. In fact, <B>several hours every day</B>. After each exercise, the foreskin feels very <B>dry</B> and upon contact with the glans, there is pain. You need to pour some water on the foreskin, because it has a lot of dry oil on it, and once there is water, the foreskin will again be oily and slippery,<BR>
the way the glans loves it.<P>
After such a long exercise you should be able to retract further than <BR>
ever before. That's an <B>immediate effect after such an exercise</B>, which<BR>
neutralizes after a few hours. However, if spent enough time doing this <BR>
every day, you'll reach <B>goal v0.9</B>, and from that onward <B>it's easy.</B><P>
Stretching should not be painful, just <B>forceful enough</B> so that the skin<BR>
feels it's being stretched. Then inevitable physics take over:<P>
<B>WHEN SKIN IS BEING STRETCHED, NEW CELLS ARE BEING MADE, AND THE SKIN<BR>
becomes more elastic</B>. The area of the skin INCREASES. That's why people<BR>
are able to get a large stomach. If the skin was fixed, people who ate <BR>
a lot couldn't grow a large tummy!<P>
Even worse, without this rule plastic surgeons would starve to death. <BR>
Their entire business is based upon the fact that skin is able to <B>expand</B><BR>
when <B>pressure is added</B>. How do you enlarge women's breasts if the skin<BR>
has a fixed area? Where does the extra skin come from? <P>
This is why stretching the foreskin <B>works</B>. <BR>
But wait, how do you reach <B>goal v0.8</B>? What if the skin is so tight, that<BR>
you CANNOT insert two fingers into it and stretch from the inside?<BR>
That's exactly the case I had, because I really had the <B>worst case scenario</B> of tight foreskin - so tight that I've never seen my own glans until January 2003, when I was 20 years old. The tip of the foreskin was <B>tight, red and irritated</B>, and no way was it possible to insert two fingers into it!<P>

Its funny but over the last few days ive received a few emails from people asking me about my phimosis and about the dorsil slit that I have had done to correct it.  The funny thing is that I havent recieved any emails in months on that topic and all of a sudden Im being asked about it again and it just so happens to be the year aniversery of my surgery.  So since im getting questions I figure Ill just tell my story again. <BR>
My phimois started gradually when I was about 27 (3 years ago) at first It just seemed like a patch of dry skin.  After ignoring it for about 6 to 8 months I went to the doctor. He quickly diagnosed it as phimosis and said that I needed a circ.  He then sent me to a urolgist who also said that I should have a circ.  But he said that it wasnt a "real phimosis" since I didnt have a infection and I wasnt a diabetic.  I asked him about stretching and steriods but he said that they didnt work and he wouldnt give me a presciption for them.  At that point I started stretching without the steriods, I tried to stretch to fast and made my condition worse.  At that point my wife made me see another urologist so I went through the phone book and found an Indian doc. (I thought he would be more foreskin friendly).  Not only did he tell me that I needed a circ. he told me that "phimosis always leads to cancer" if its untreated.  At that point I changed my thinking and went to see a deratologist, he was great.  We tried steriods but the problem was that by this point I had alot of scar tissue and its very difficult to stretch a scar.  After several months I was back at the urologist (a different one).  I changed my tactics for this urolgist, As soon as the doc. came into the exam room I detailed my problem and what I wanted done BEFORE he examined me. I had told him that I wanted a dorsil slit and I would not consider a circ.  And to my shock and amazement he agreed.  He said that most people want the circ "to look like everyone else" and he said that the dorsil slit was the right choice for my phimosis if I wanted it. <BR>
So last Dec. I had the slit, the recovery was quick and I only needed the pain medication for the first day.  The night time erections were rough(i kept an ice pack next to the bed) but after the first few days I was in very little pain.  And by 2 1/2 weeks I could pull my foreskin back and by 3 1/2 weeks I could have very careful sex with my wife.  I was very concered about my sex life changing after having the slit I had read info on the internet and this forum about sex being different after a circ. and that was a big concern.  But, with the slit Ive noticed no difference from before.  The "gliding motion" of the foreskin hasnt been affected by the dorsil slit.  I do recommend that anyone with a phimois try strecting with the steriod creams Its not fun to have anytype of surgery.  And to consider going to a dermatolgist instead of a urolgist for help with a phimosis.  However, If that has failed you, and you still have a problem that you are considering surgery. take the time to research all the procedures that correct phimosis.  If you are considering a dorsil slit read the discription in www.male-initiation.net  look at the pics. (I sent them into robin, my way of giving back to the forum that helped me) And always get a second or third or even forth opionion from a doctor.<P>

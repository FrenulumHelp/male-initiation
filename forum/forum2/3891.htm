Hi Joe<P>
See <A HREF="2247.htm">Stretching Exercises for Phimosis</A> and <A HREF=" http://www.cirp.org/library/treatment/phimosis/beauge " target="_blank">Beaugé</A>.  I’m getting like a broken record here in that I usually refer to these pages.  Maybe you’ve looked at them already.<BR>
 <BR>
What about stretching exercises for Frenulum Breve though?  I know of five exercises that might be useful.  What is frenulum breve?  Well, here’s my own take.  <P>
MILD FRENULUM BREVE<P>
Defining our terms:  the lower foreskin is the foreskin adjoining the frenulum, and the upper foreskin is the foreskin on the opposite, or upper, side of the penis.  (This isn’t an anatomical distinction; it’s just a terminological convenience.)  Mild frenulum breve is when the lower foreskin is short relative to the upper foreskin.  This means that during retraction, the lower foreskin will stretch tight before the upper foreskin does.  Consequently, since there is still potential for further retraction in the upper foreskin, attempting to retract fully produces tension in the frenulum and the skin surrounding it.  This causes the glans to rotate, and pulls it downwards.  The resulting tension in the frenulum can be uncomfortable, or even downright painful, and the skin may tend to get red and tender during sex.<P>
Another way of putting this is that the lower foreskin stretches tight before the upper foreskin does, and tends to reach its full stretch before the penis has pushed all the way in to whatever it is pushing into.  The impulse to push all the way in is pretty strong, however, so it is difficult to avoid putting sometimes painful tension on the frenulum.<P>
The key to resolving mild frenulum breve is to stretch the lower foreskin relative to the upper foreskin.  Each of the five exercises described below aims at producing a differential stretch.  The exercises put the lower foreskin under more tension than the upper foreskin.  Given enough time, the exercises should cause the lower foreskin to stretch, which will mean the frenulum becomes tight only when the upper foreskin approaches its full stretch.  The penis will then be able to push almost all the way in to whatever it is pushing into before the frenulum starts to get tight.<P>
<BR>
THE EXERCISES<P>
<BR>
FB EXERCISE 0:  Tube  (Invented by Ralesk and PaulB, and discovered independently by many boys).<P>
Soft.  Every time you take a bath or a shower, and every time you piss, grasp the lower lip of the spout of your foreskin in a pincer like grip. Use the thumb and first finger of both hands to form the grip, then pull your foreskin as far forwards as you can.  It will form a tube that extends an inch or more beyond the tip of your glans.  Maintaining forward tension, pull your hands gently apart so as to spread the tube as wide as you can.  Hold this for a minute or so, and then repeat.  <P>
Since you're pulling on your lower foreskin here, this exercise tends to stretch it and your frenulum more than it stretches your upper foreskin.  The exercise will hopefully stretch your frenulum enough so that full retraction  becomes possible.<P>
<BR>
FB EXERCISE 1:  Soft Delta Stretch <P>
Soft.  Retract your foreskin so as to completely uncover your glans, and stretch it back as far as you can.  As it begins to stretch more or less smooth over the top surface of the shaft of your penis, your frenulum will become taut and your glans will begin to bend downwards.  At this point, place the first and second fingers of one hand on either side of your frenulum so that the tips of your fingers press against the two bulbs of your glans.  Use these fingers to prevent your glans from bending downwards, but continue to retract your foreskin with your other hand (your shaft hand) so as to put the frenulum and the skin surrounding it under tension.  The best way of doing this is perhaps to place the first and second fingers of your shaft hand on the under side of your penis and pull on your lower foreskin, so that you are definitely stretching your lower foreskin more than your upper foreskin.  Hold this for a minute or so and then repeat.<P>
<BR>
FB EXERCISE 2:  Bubble Gum    <P>
Soft.  Pull your foreskin back and stretch it a little way down the shaft of your penis.  Now push your index finger into the delta of skin that forms your frenulum and push so as to stretch the delta almost as if you were blowing a bubble with bubble gum.  Hold this for a minute or so and then repeat, this time pushing from the other side.<P>
<BR>
FB EXERCISE 3:  Banana  <P>
Semi Hard.  This is really a variation on exercise 1.  The difference is that you pull your penis out to its full stretch while doing the exercise, almost as if you were trying to make it longer.  When your penis is warm and loose, pull your foreskin back, and grasp the two bulbs of your glans with the first and second fingers of one hand (your glans hand).  Grasp the top surface of your glans with your thumb.  Now pull your penis out as far as you can and hold it in tension.  Using your other hand (your shaft hand) pull your foreskin as far back as you can.  Rotate your glans hand clockwise so as your penis assumes an upward-curving banana shape, and push down with your shaft hand to further accentuate the banana.  This should put more tension on your lower foreskin than it does on your upper foreskin.  Hold this for a minute or so and then repeat.<P>
FB EXERCISE 4:  Hard Delta Stretch<P>
Hard.  Do Exercise1 – soft delta stretch - while masturbating.  Pause, hold your glans in position, then stretch your lower foreskin so it becomes tight.  Hold this for a minute or so, then continue masturbating.  Alternate this with Exercise 3, which can also be done when hard.<P>
<BR>
COMMENTS<P>
FB EXERCISE 1 (the tube) could be added to Stage 0 of the  <A HREF="2247.htm">Stretching Exercises for Phimosis</A>.
<P>
If you reach the milestone for Stage 0, you’ll be able to retract completely when soft, and you’ll then be able to start on FB EXERCISES 1 and 2 (soft delta stretch and bubble gum), which could be added to Stages 1 and 2 of the phimosis program.<P>
By Stage 3, you’ve reached the stage where you can retract fully during erection, and could now include FB EXERCISES 3 and 4 (banana and hard delta stretch).  FB EXERCISE 3 (banana) seems particularly effective.<P>
<BR>
TIP<P>
Learn to masturbate with either hand, and switch hands regularly.  If you masturbate exclusively with your right hand, you may find that the left-hand side of your foreskin stretches more than the right-hand side.  You could even end up with mild right-handed frenulum breve.<P>
A long post.  Sorry.  Maybe it will suggest some useful ideas though.  All the best.<P>

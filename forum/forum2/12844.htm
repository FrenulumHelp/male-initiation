    This a beginning of a lengthy document, which I have<BR>
divided into chapters so that it's easy to read.<BR>
I don't anyone to <B>answer</B> to any of the chapters, except<BR>
the last ones where I say it's OK to do so. Otherwise the<BR>
reader might get confused and not able to read this<BR>
document <B>sequentially</B>.<P>
	First, about myself: I am a person who, until the age of 21,<BR>
was suffering with <B>phimosis</B> ("tight foreskin"). A person is<BR>
said to have phimosis if he can't retract the foreskin (the<BR>
skin that covers the glans) all the way behind the <B>glans</B>. <P>
	If you're a person with foreskin problems of your own, you<BR>
very well might be very confused about the whole issue - just<BR>
like I was. Not only could I not retract the foreskin, I've never<BR>
ever seen a glimpse of my glans, and I didn't even understand what<BR>
a glans was. I didn't understand what I saw in hard porn movies.<BR>
I just understood that my penis was <B>different</B>. <P>
	If read this and know something is wrong with your penis, the first<BR>
thing you should do is to see your <B>General Physician</B>, at the very least<BR>
you'll know the name of your disease/condition.<P>
	I saw mine September 9th, 2002 and for the first time someone explained<BR>
to me what was wrong with me. Ever since February 11th 2002 I understood<BR>
something was wrong with my penis, but I was living with my parents and<BR>
afraid to talk about my problem with them. Instead, I was searching all<BR>
over the Internet, which was hopeless, because I wrongly assumed something<BR>
ELSE was wrong with me (more on that later: this is the full story, and <BR>
I'm not hiding ANYTHING, not even my own stupidity!).<P>
	My GP scheduled a foreskin-correction surgery for me. It was NOT<BR>
circumcision, as would be the case in US, since this is Europe and doctors <BR>
are more sceptical to such drastical solutions. <P>
	Still surgery is surgery, and I understood one thing, despite the state<BR>
of utter confusion and manic depression, which is this: my penis would<BR>
look different and quite possibly have different sexual sensations than<BR>
if I never had phimosis in the first place.<P>
	So, there was one thing I wanted more than anything else - to find a way<BR>
to correct my problem in a way that would convice me of this:<P>
* There would be no difference whether I had phimosis for 21 years or not<BR>
* There would be no difference between my penis and that of majority<BR>
  of other European males.<P>
Today, I am totally convinced that I have achieved my goal, and I am<BR>
here to fulfill my 2-part pledge I gave to Destiny if my wish got fulfilled:<P>
1) I'll go to my GP and tell him of an alternative, for many people a better,<BR>
   way of dealing with phimosis than the standard surgery responce. <BR>
   This I had not yet done, but I will do before the end of 2004<P>
2) I would post my story here on ARC Forum2 or any other comparable web page<BR>
   about my experience.<P>
The point to help other people with the same problem as I had, if not for<BR>
the sake of being compassionate, then for the sake of fulfilling my part of<BR>
the contract.<P>
Enjoy this story!

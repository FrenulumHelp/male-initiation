As an answer to: <A HREF="12844.htm">My Full And Honest Experience With Phimosis</A> written by chImp at 02 Sep 2004 20:13:18:<P>

<B>PART X - It worked for me too!</B><P>
I urge other people, who have <B>cured their<BR>
phimosis by stretching</B>, to answer to this message and<BR>
tell about their experience. However, the whole<BR>
point of it all is to be able to have

<PRE><BR>
   <strong>delicious,<BR>
      condomless,<BR>
         heterosexual<BR>
            sex!</strong></PRE>
<P>
(plus masturbation) <P>
That was my criteria, and finally, I fulfilled it<BR>
myself! I have had <B>decent sex</B> and quite <B>great masturbating<BR>
moments</B> after <B>I solved my phimosis problem!</B><P>
Most importantly, it has given me a lot of <B>confidence!</B><P>
Anyone, feel free to <B>copy my entire story</B> and post it<BR>
on your own site, provided your goal is to help <B>educate <BR>
people about phimosis.</B>

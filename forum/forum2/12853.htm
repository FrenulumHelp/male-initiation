<B>PART IX - Success!!!</B><P>
Then, the next time me and my girlfriend tried sex, <B>everything<BR>
worked perfectly!</B> From that time onward we had sex a few more<BR>
times, and when the summer ended, like most couples, we broke <BR>
up. However, thanks to her I was <B>finally convinced</B> that I had<BR>
no such thing as a sexual problem anymore! As of now <B>(September 2004),</B><BR>
I masturbate almost every day, everything works fine! It's SO easy,<BR>
as was <B>having sex</B> with my girl. <P>
And the foreskin is <B>unbelievably elastic</B>! I can retract it all the way<BR>
even when I have an erection!<P>
So, where am I now? <P>
I'm a 21-year old guy <B>with a completely normal dick</B>. You could take <BR>
out a magnifying glass and try to spot any difference between me<BR>
and other intact males! And masturbation has never been as pleasurable<BR>
as now! Now I DO understand, why sex is so delightful. And I haven't<BR>
even experienced the best of it. <P>
And, as promised, <B>I'll thank Destiny</B> for giving me a solution to the <BR>
problem. <B>I'll thank Jake Booth</B> for being an example and leading the way.<BR>
And most importantly, <B>I'll thank the Internet</B>, for giving me the <BR>
opportunity to find Jake Booth's description on how he cured phimosis<BR>
by stretching. <P>
It wasn't on this site I found the description, but it had a link to this<BR>
site, and since then I've posted a lot here - some useful, some less useful.<P>
<B>I hope what you just spent several minutes reading is indeed useful to you!</B><P>
I believe very much in curing phimosis by <B>stretching, not surgery. </B><BR>
It takes time, but I'm glad I did it!<P>
I'm not saying that the same solution fits all people. Many people <B>willingly</B> undertake circumcision in the US when they are adults (for no reason at all), and are happy with the results. So treating phimosis with <B>circumcision</B> (or more concervative surgery) is still <B>a valid option.</B><P>
My job was to give you <B>another option</B>, because it just might be your<BR>
psychological profile shares similarities with mine, thus making you<BR>
<B>anxious</B> about the permanent effects <B>surgery</B> will have on your penis and <B>envious</B> about men who didn't undergo any surgery.<P>
<B>Good luck to you, my fellow guy with phimosis! </B><P>

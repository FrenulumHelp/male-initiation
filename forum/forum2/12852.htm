<B>PART VIII - Sensitivity</B><P>
So, what now?<P>
First of all, my glans was <B>EXTREMELY sensitive</B> way beyond <BR>
what is needed for a normal person. <P>
I still masturbated face-down, rubbing my penis with <BR>
a <B>thin piece of clothing</B>, while the glans was fully covered with<BR>
the foreskin.<P>
After a while, this became <B>problematic</B>, because now when I got<BR>
an erection, part of the glans was exposed and touching it with<BR>
ANYTHING led to <B>excruciating pain</B>. <P>
Imagine this: I lay down, tuck my penis inside a thin T-shirt<BR>
and start reading a porno mag. The erection grows. As long I<BR>
lay still, nothing happenes. But when I start gently rubbing it<BR>
using the T-shirt, at some point the <B>glans gets exposed</B>, leading<BR>
to pain and <B>immidiate loss of erection</B>. <P>
And I could still not masturbate the normal way, which looks<BR>
to me today as the <B>very definition</B> of a normal, unphimosed, person.<P>
However, the glans slowly adopted to the <B>new deal</B>, and I even<BR>
started worrying - was I losing the hard-gained sensitivity <B>for<BR>
which I fought so long and so hard</B>? The answer is definitely, unequivocally,<BR>
<B>NO</B>. To this very day I am <B>more sensitive</B> than a person who has never had phimosis. In fact, I was forced to <B>LOWER my sensitivity</B>, otherwise I momentarily <B>lost the erection</B> when I attempted having sex with my girlfriend.<P>
I was still worried about me <B>masturbating the wrong way</B>. So I tricked my<BR>
penis to become <B>adjusted to the normal masturbating style</B> by<BR>
reaching the pre-orgasm state the old way, and then finishing off the <BR>
new way, the right way. <P>
<B>2004, January 1st</B>. I actually managed to successfully masturbate using<BR>
only hands - from the beginning till the end! The way most normal people do it! Since then it was the desired way for me!<P>
<B>2004, April. I get my first girlfriend</B>. <P>
<B>2004, May</B>.  I persuade her to start using <B>birth control pills.</B><BR>
     I am very insecure about sex, and certainly about using<BR>
     <B>condoms</B>. I tried to masturbate with a condom on once, but<BR>
     failed. It is very unpleasant when the condom touches<BR>
     the glans! Plus I thought (again, wrongly), that wearing<BR>
     condoms during sex not only DIMINISHES sensitivity for <BR>
     the duration of the sex act, <B>but does so forever</B>. And if I<BR>
     started to have sex with a condom on, how would I know what it<BR>
     would feel like to have sex the first time WITHOUT a condom?<BR>
     I'd have nothing to compare it to. <B>My FIRST time DEFINITELY<BR>
     HAD to be WITHOUT any condom.</B><P>
<B>2004, End of May</B>. I make a first attempt to have sex. I fail.<BR>
     The thing is: I get aroused, then I try to insert the penis<BR>
     into the vagina. At this point the glans makes contact with the<BR>
     skin right outside of the vagina, and I automatically <B>lose the<BR>
     erection.</B> <P>
I understood that my worries about sensitivity were unjustified:<BR>
I had a long way to go before I'd have the same sensitivity<BR>
level as the other guys! I'm a <B>lucky bastard</B> who had so much <BR>
sensitivity I even had to <B>desensitise myself</B>!  <P>
As my girlfriend told me, <B>most guys liked the girl touching their<BR>
privates</B>. I didn't: the contact of the glans and fingers meant <B>physical<BR>
pain.</B> <P>
Anyway, my ingenuity saved me once again, besides, like history<BR>
teaches us, <B>it takes no brain desensiting yourself, it's the opposite<BR>
that is difficult if at all possible.</B><P>
I took that same thin T-shist, which I for a couple of years had used<BR>
as a masturbating tool alongside with pyjamas.<BR>
Now I wrapped it around my penis and SLOWLY started to retract the foreskin,<BR>
exposing the glans. The most painful area of the glans was the opening<BR>
from the urine comes out <B>("urethra"). </B><P>
The thing is that once you retract the foreskin, it's painful and unpleasant,<BR>
but there's really not anything you can do! You can't simply remove<BR>
the T-shirt, because that would lead to even more pain, and I knew it!<P>
I started slowly to shake my penis. The T-shirt was rubbing it and it was <BR>
painful. However, I shook it for an hour or so, and it slowly went from<BR>
painful to merely unpleasant, to neutral and finally to pleasuring,<BR>
giving me <B>a great orgasm!</B><P>
After that I also rubbed the exposed glans against the outer of my<BR>
girlfriend's pussy for an hour or so. <P>
After that it (temporarily) became <B>more difficult</B> for me to masturbate. Remember, at this time I only used the correct way. For several days it took me<BR>
<B>up to an hour</B> to get an orgasm by means of masturbation (at this point,<BR>
me and my girlfriend were in different countries, and we still haven't<BR>
had successful sex).<P>

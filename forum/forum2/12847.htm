<B>PART III - Doctors Know Everything</B><P>
   The spring/summer months of 2002 were a hell for me.<BR>
   I understood something was <B>seriously wrong</B> with me,<BR>
   I was mistaken about what it was. I knew I wouldn't <BR>
   have much of a sensation if I were to have <B>sex</B>. <BR>
   I came across all those numerous Internet sites that<BR>
   tell you how <B>bad</B> it is to be <B>circumcised</B>. I thought<BR>
   I was circed myself, though in reality it was quite <BR>
   the opposite - I had a tight foreskin and have never<BR>
   seen my own <B>glans</B>.<P>
   I was filled with rage and depression that I was robbed<BR>
   of something important. I was vehemently anti-circ at<BR>
   that time, and I have had a distaste for <B>Routine Infant Circumcision</B><BR>
   ever since. Muslims and Jews do it to their children, and so do<BR>
   about 50% of American parents.<P>
   Even worse: as I understand now, my urine was collecting<BR>
   itself underneath my foreskin (it was virtually trapped), which<BR>
   lately caused unpleasant sensations when I was walking or touching my <BR>
   penis. <P>
   I had a problem, and everytime I heard the word "circumcision",<BR>
   it reminded me. Whenever I walked, it reminded me. Whenever I saw<BR>
   people have sex on TV or masturbated myself, it reminded me. <BR>
 <BR>
   So finally I went to the doctor. It was a female doctor, and I told <BR>
   her ("The top of my penis bothers me - that's glans isn't it? And oh,<BR>
   I was circumcised when I was an infant because I had phimosis"). That            statement couldn't be further from the truth.<P>
   So, guess what she told me? She studied my penis closely and gave<BR>
   me some cream or whatever to put it there. I were to return in a couple<BR>
   of weeks if there was no improvement.<P>
   No <B>"What are you, crazy? You're not circumcised at all. Where did<BR>
   you get that absurd idea?</B>". Just the perscription for the cream.<BR>
   Apparently, some female doctors do know the difference between <BR>
   circumcised and uncircumcised("<B>intact</B>").<P>
   Luckily, when I came back, I appointed a male doctor as my GP. He<BR>
   told me exactly what I didn't hear the last time. He immideately<BR>
   put me on waiting list for an operation (I think, maybe a "<B>dorsal             slit</B>", certainly not a circumcision). <P>
   That was <B>September 9th 2002, the WORST day of my life</B>. Because when I<BR>
   came back to my apartment, I collapsed. I didn't understand ANYTHING.<BR>
   Depression is when you don't bother doing anything. What I had is this:<BR>
   EVERY single thought led to PAIN. Not only could I not do anything but<BR>
   lie on the bed, I couldn't even THINK about anything, because that led<BR>
   to a mental <B>AGONY</B>. <P>
   I never ever had experienced such a mental state in my life- not before<BR>
   that day, nor ever after. <P>
   After a few days I calmed down. I becan to understand a bit more about<BR>
   how the penis works. And I accepted that I had to undergo that surgery.<BR>
   I just waited for that letter in the mailbox that would say that<BR>
   it was my turn. <P>
   However, I was utterly depressed. <B>I had no faith in doctors</B>. How could <BR>
   they slice open my foreskin, and everything suddenly would be OK?<BR>
   Like I never had phimosis?<P>
   The answer is: <B>it would NOT be OK</B>. I later came across pictures of        what a dorsal slit looks like. On those pictures, half the glans is exposed.<BR>
   And the foreskin is cut on opposit sides. That did not look good, and<BR>
   all the anti-circ material reminded me how fast I will lose the sensitivity<BR>
   of the glans if nothing covers it. <P>
   What I wanted, was to have a penis that would look and function as if<BR>
   I grew up WITHOUT phimosis. That operation failed that test. <P>
   So, I just waited for my operation. But then something <B>fascinating</B>        happened to me.

As an answer to: <A HREF="12844.htm">My Full And Honest Experience With Phimosis</A> written by chImp at 02 Sep 2004 20:13:18:<P>

<B>PART I - This Is Not Normal</B><P>
During my entire childhood I had several abnormalities<BR>
which I later understood was the result of phimosis:<P>
1) After peeing, I had no good way of "shaking it off",<BR>
   because most of the urine stayed under the foreskin,<BR>
   which was very tight. This often resulted in wet stains <BR>
   on my underwear.<P>
2) I knew the traditional way of masturbating was using<BR>
   your right hand. I didn't understand the mechanism<BR>
   of it, because I didn't understand what "retracting"<BR>
   meant, since it was not part of my penile functionality.<P>
   So I masturbated lying face down on the bed, rubbing a<BR>
   thin peace of clothing over the penis. A normal person<BR>
   would not understand how this would work and is not<BR>
   able to do the same, because phimosed people have<BR>
   <B>extraordinary sensitivity</B>.<P>
3) Masturbating this was easy and somewhat pleasurable, but I<BR>
   JUST COULDN'T understand, how it could POSSIBLY be as pleasurable<BR>
   as Hollywood and anecdotal evidence suggests it is. Remember,<BR>
   "retracting" and "glans" were not part of my vocabulary, because<BR>
   I've never retracted my foreskin and I've never seen my glans.<BR>
   In fact, I looked at the tip of my foreskin, and thought that it<BR>
   was all that generated the pleasure (which isn't the case, as most of the <BR>
   pleasure comes from the glans - a person can have orgasms without<BR>
   the foreskin but not without the glans).<P>
   OK, I figured: when I rubbed something over the tip of foreskin,<BR>
   I get pleasure. That's all, there are no other sources. What if<BR>
   put my dick into a vagina? How different will it be from just rubbing<BR>
   it myself? The answer was <B>no, it wouldn't be any more pleasurable</B>, and<BR>
   thus I had a problem: I understood, I COULDN'T enjoy sex like a normal<BR>
   person would. This was the major cause of my 2002 half-year long depression.<P>
4) At some point my instict told me to try to retract the foreskin.<BR>
   It was painful, I didn't try it again for a long time and concluded<BR>
   that it wasn't how it operated.<P>
5) I didn't have the "fold" like the other guys had. I can't explain<BR>
   what I mean by this. There's no need, if the reader has tight foreskin,<BR>
   he doesn't have it. Basically, when a person retracts his foreskin often<BR>
   (masturbation/sex), the foreskin appears to be shorter and thicker.<BR>
   <BR>
   So I started to take closer looks at the other guys in the lockerroom<BR>
   (I wear glasses, so I when I showered with the other guys, my glasses<BR>
   were put aside and I couldn't see nothing).<P>
   Despite all of these abnormalities, I was used to my own penis -<BR>
   it was everything I've ever known - and I was blissfully oblivious<BR>
   that I had a HUGE PROBLEM. That ended February 11th 2002, when<BR>
   I watched a documentary on TV, and something hit me like a lightning:<P>
   <B>I WAS DIFFERENT AND I HAD A PROBLEM</B>.

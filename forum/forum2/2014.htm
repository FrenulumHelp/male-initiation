>>By which I presume you mean you've had sex and it works OK as it does for the huge majority world-wide of people in your situation, both now and in the past.  So what do you feel that is "wrong"?  Not that it isn't desirable to be able to retract your foreskin, but what particular advantages are <I>you</I> expecting from making it work "normally"?<BR>
><BR>
>I am surprised and disapointed that you would consider that a pinhole phimosis which doesn't uncover head at all would be considered "normal" and not make it extremely clear that the norm is to have a fully and easily retractable foreskin both soft and hard. <P>
What you say here makes sense.  A pinhole phimosis would make it extremely difficult to achieve a normal sex life.  (No, I haven't had a pinhole phimosis so can't speak from personal experience, nonetheless what I'm saying here would seem to most rational folk to be self-evident!)<P>
>Anyone whose foreskin does not fully uncover easily or who has too long a foreskin or has an overly sensitive glans does not have an optimum penis. If during sex, you must be careful for fear that certain movements will hurt, then you do not have a fully functioning penis.<P>
Well said.<P>
>Another point you are conveniently avoiding is that of hygiene. If the male cannot retract his foreskin, how is he supposed to clean under the foreskin ? Improper hygiene of the glans will yield to problems eventually.<P>
Yes, and conveniently avoiding the inescapable fact that normally a woman is  involved in the sex act, and few (if any) women can be expected to put up with sloppy hygiene.<P>
>Such a condition must be resolved if the male wants full use of his genitals and wants to be able to prevent problems/diseases later on.<P>
True.<P>
>Arguments that circumcusion doesn't significantly change cancer rates are only valid in sutuations where proper hygiene is practiced. But if you allow a phimosis to continue, all bets are off and that person will contribute to negative statistics about being uncut.<P>
Interestingly, a Canadian doctor has pointed out that the two provinces with the highest rates of penile cancer are also those with the lowest rates of circumcision:  Quebec & Nova Scotia.<BR>
Another interesting fact:  since the end of World War II, the rate of penile cancer in Denmark has gone down significantly.  This is attributed to the widespread installation of indoor plumbing since 1945.  Few Danish men are circumcised, but most of them obviously practice good hygiene.<BR>
>>> I'm seeing a specialist in two week's -- is a circumcision the only option?<BR>
>>What concerns us is that for many, notably American "specialists", which is to say surgeon/ urologists. circumcision <I>is</I> the only option.  It's not that they don't <I>know</I> any other ways of dealing with the problem, though some quite possibly don't even nowadays, but most people go to them for the "quick fix" with a minimum of "fuss", that is, the patient sees a problem, wants it fixed, but doesn't really care what the consequence is or presumes there is only one way to approach it.<BR>
>>So, what the surgeon offers, tends to be what the "masses" want.  He very rapidly gets tired of offering <I>alternatives</I> which take time and personal effort (<I>discipline</I> is the good, old-fashioned word! <B>;-)</B>, to people like our keen poster here AJ for example, who are young and impatient.  After a few tries, he just gives up and presumes that if they have been sent to him, they want an operation.<BR>
>>Anyway, point is that since you ask, we suspect that you <I>might</I> actually want to sort the problem out in such a way that you end up with a foreskin that works in the manner it is supposed to as described <A HREF="http://www.cirp.org/pages/anat/#gliding">here</A>.  There are <I>major</I> advantages in sexual performance to having a functional foreskin, though the trick is that (since in youth, <I>everything</I> about having sex seems great) they tend to show up later in life and many of them are related to how women experience and enjoy intercourse, and many men aren't sufficiently perceptive to notice that.<BR>
>>AJ is most certainly correct in pointing out that a classical circumcision is not the only <I>surgical</I> option, a "dorsal slit" consists of enlarging the opening of the foreskin to the necessary degree but without actually <I>removing</I> any skin and with negligible damage to the nerve supply.  A "partial circumcision" removes the tight part of the foreskin and supposedly produces a better cosmetic result (but mainly because it resembles a full circumcision which is with what many people are familiar) but causes as much damage to the nerve supply and does not generally retain full <A HREF="http://www.cirp.org/pages/anat/#gliding">function</A> of the foreskin.<BR>
>>What Jim and I suggest -- and you should read this whole forum page in detail to follow it and understand how different people react to the proposal, but this (1880.htm) post of mine summarises it quickly -- is the procedure of progressive <I>continuous</I> stretching of the tight part from however tight it is now, all the way to a full width which would easily slide back over your erect penis head.<BR>
>>You will find here a (quite) small army of "knockers" against this idea, mostly telling you it will "only work for some people and if it isn't too tight to start with".  Well, the "some people" are those who kick in and do it, and "too tight" means "I don't want to try".  The technique of "tissue expansion" is (a surprisingly recent innovation) now used widely throughout plastic and reconstructive surgery, so it certainly <I>is</I> mainstream medicine.  Yet because it involves personal effort as applied to your situation, and circumcision is "quicker" (particularly when discounting the healing phase), people do go for that much of the time.<BR>
>>Hey, I don't know whether it is for you, but have a good read up on it on this forum for sure.  Go see the surgeon, but just remember that he is only offering you <I>his</I> standard option, the craft skill he has practiced over the years and <I>naturally</I> he thinks it's the "best thing since sliced bread".  If you want to put the work into it yourself instead, that's <I>your</I> option and you are entitled to make that choice.<BR>

As an answer to: 2237.htm Given up hope, can someone help me? written by Russell at 04 Mar 2002 14:02:11:

Hi Russell,<P>
This doesn’t address your questions, but maybe you’ll have time to read through it and tell me what you think.  I was wondering if the specialist you saw suggested a reasonably well-defined program of stretching, with milestones and such.  The program that follows is approximately the program I used myself, though I wasn’t very systematic since I was trying to work it out on my own.  In all, it took me about a year and a half.<P>
Four exercises are described.  These are then combined to produce a program with milestones and approximate durations.<P>
EXERCISE 0:  Soft.  Every time you take a shower or bath, and every time you take a piss, gently pull your foreskin back as far as you can, and hold it for a minute or so.<P>
EXERCISE 1:	Hard.  When your penis is erect, pull your foreskin back as far as you can.  Hold it in tension for a minute.  Give yourself a break for a minute or so and do what ever you need to maintain your erection.  Repeat.<P>
EXERCISE 2:  Soft.  Get two fingers inside the cuff of your foreskin.  This will be tricky at first, and the thing to do is to pull you foreskin back so that it rests behind your glans, then press the tips of the first finger of each hand (nails facing inwards) gently into your glans and roll your foreskin forward over your glans so that it rolls over the tips of your fingers too.  You may have to adjust your fingers, or start again, placing your fingers further down towards the ridge at the base of your glans.  When you can get your foreskin to cover your fingers by about a centimetre or so, pull your fingers gently apart, trying to angle them so that the tips of your fingers pull slightly further apart than your two first knuckles.  This angling should keep your foreskin from sliding off your fingers.  Keep your foreskin under tension for a minute or so, then release.  Repeat.<P>
EXERCISE 3:  Hard.  Using a fist type grip, pull your foreskin back as far as it will go, uncovering your glans completely.  At the bottom of each stroke, try to stretch the skin down the shaft of your penis.  Give it really good stretch, then slide your fist back up again so your foreskin rolls over your glans to cover it completely or almost completely.  Repeat.<P>
<P>
PROGRAM<BR>
	<BR>
Depending on how loose your foreskin is to start with you may be able to jump straight to a later stage.<P>
<P>
STAGE 0  (estimated time required  :  1 month).<P>
EXERCISE 0 and EXERCISE 1.<P>
Exercise 0  :  as many reps as convenient each day<BR>
Exercise 1  :  10 reps per day<BR>
Time         :  15 minutes/day (since you do Exercise 0 while doing other things too)<P>
MILESTONE  :  easy retraction to expose the glans completely when soft.<BR>
	<BR>
The goal of Exercise 0 is to be able to retract your foreskin behind your glans when your penis is soft, and then roll it forwards again.  Exercise 1 helps towards the goal of Exercise 0.  This is because your glans probably gets a fair bit bigger on erection, so you will be able to use its enlarged conical form to stretch your preputial ring and make it looser.  This in turn will make it easier to retract your foreskin when your penis is soft.  When you are able to retract easily when soft, you’ve reached the milestone for Stage 0.  You’ll be able to accustom your glans to gentle handling, which prepares you for Exercise 2 of Stage 1.<P>
<P>
STAGE 1  (Estimated time required  :  2 months)<P>
EXERCISE 1 and EXERCISE 2<P>
Exercise 1  :  10 reps per day	<BR>
Exercise 2  :  10 reps every second day<BR>
Time         :  20 minutes/day<P>
MILESTONE  :  retraction to expose the glans completely when erect.<P>
Exercise 1 is now working towards the goal of being able to retract the foreskin so as to uncover the glans completely when the penis is fully erect, and then roll it forwards again without too much difficulty.  Exercise 2 helps with this by further loosening the preputial ring. <P>
Tip:  When, during erection, you first pull your foreskin back behind your glans, it may seem difficult to get it forwards again.  If it really seems stuck, don’t panic.  Squeeze your glans gently but firmly with one hand - to push the blood out of it - then roll your foreskin forwards.  Give it a rest for today, but don’t give up.  <P>
When you can get your foreskin back behind your glans when your penis is fully erect and then roll it forwards again without much difficulty, you’ve reached the milestone for Stage 1 and are ready for Exercise 3 of Stage 2.<P>
<P>
STAGE 2  (Estimated time required  :  1 month)<P>
EXERCISE 3 and EXERCISE 2<P>
Exercise 3  :  20 minutes (~600 reps if you can be bothered to count) each day	<BR>
Exercise 2  :  10 reps every second day<BR>
Time         :  30 minutes/day<P>
MILESTONE  :  stretching a little way down the shaft then rolling back easily to recover the glans.<P>
The goal of Exercise 3 is to get the foreskin so as it will stretch a little way down the shaft of the penis and then roll easily forwards again so as to cover the glans completely or almost completely.  Exercise 2 helps continue to loosen the foreskin.  When you retract your foreskin to uncover the glans completely and can roll your foreskin forwards again fairly easily, you’ve reached the milestone for Stage 2.  You can drop Exercise 2 and move on to Stage 3.<P>
<P>
STAGE 3  (Estimated time required  :  2 months)<P>
EXERCISE 3<P>
Exercise 3  :  30 minutes (~900 reps if you can be bothered to count) each day<BR>
Time         :  30 minutes / day<P>
MILESTONE  :  stretching the foreskin down the shaft so it begins to smooth out.<BR>
MILESTONE  :  becoming addicted to the amazing sensations this generates.<BR>
MILESTONE  :  developing control over ejaculation.<BR>
MILESTONE  :  having sex with someone else, and really giving them pleasure.<P>
In stage 3, the goal of Exercise 3 is to develop an easy, silky action so it becomes possible to access the powerful stretch sensations generated when the foreskin is stretched down the shaft of the penis.  At the bottom of each stroke really stretch the skin back.  Try thrusting your pelvis into your fist too.<P>
Near the base of your penis there is a muscle that you can use to stop the flow of urine when you’re pissing.  To delay ejaculation, take your hand off your cock, and tense this muscle as hard as you can.  Your erection will probably become outstandingly firm, but you won’t ejaculate.  Let the pre-ejaculatory tremors subside, then continue.<P>
If you work at Exercise 3 fairly diligently for two months or so, you should notice that your foreskin really begins to loosen up.  Exercise 3 is really just the standard hold-in-your-fist style masturbation that many guys seem to discover entirely by themselves.  It seems to be necessary training.<P>
Exercise 3 is kind of odd, because at first it may seem as if you are being a bit rough with yourself, stretching quite hard almost to the point of pain.  Pretty soon, though, the impression of roughness seems to disappear, and is replaced by an amazingly silky feeling.  Your cock is amazingly hard, but the skin on it is soft and loose.<P>
<P>
ADDITIONAL<P>
A neat thing about this program is that you invest time according to your success so far.  The exercises for Stage 0 aren’t particularly rewarding in themselves, but you only spend 15 minutes a day on them.  By the time you get to Stage 3,  30 minutes will be easy to find, because Exercise 3 is very rewarding.  10 minutes in the morning, say, and 20 at night.  And because you’re learning to control ejaculation, you won’t need to spunk every time.  In fact, if you don’t spunk each time you’ll feel horny a lot, which can be a pretty good feeling, though maybe horniness begins to lose its distracting urgency only when you hit your thirties.<P>
For me anyway, the most amazing pre-orgasmic sensations in sex are when my foreskin stretches back and, to slightly lesser extent, when it rolls forward again.  I don’t know if a partial circ interferes with these sensations.  (AJ, if you’ve had the patience to read this far, maybe you have some thoughts on this.)  My glans generates deep sensations of sexual pleasure during penetration, but these have a different quality from foreskin-generated sensations which seem almost narcotic rather than sexual.<P>
<P>
Keep off cigarettes (they ruin circulation and delay skin repair even in quite young people).  Limit alcohol to weekends.  Take a cod liver oil capsule every day, and maybe some gelatine too.  Keep fit.  The usual stuff:  walk for an hour each day, or go running, or swim, or go to a gym.  Loose fitting underwear seems not a bad idea either, though I don’t know if this actually contributes anything.  If your skin is at all sensitive to biological washing powder, wearing briefs can give you dry, itchy balls, which probably won’t help.  Even with non-biological washing powder, briefs seem to give me dry, itchy balls anyway, so I wear boxers or boxer briefs instead.  Anything that dries your skin probably won’t help.<P>
Don’t use soap, bubble bath, or shampoo on your glans or on the inner surface of your foreskin.  Warm water should be fine.  If you think you might have scrum pox – a fungal infection like athlete’s foot, but on your balls – get some Canestan and clear this up.  If you’ve got athlete’s foot, try to clear this up too.<P>

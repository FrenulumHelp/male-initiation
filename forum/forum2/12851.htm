<B>PART VII - Things Are Happening!</B><P>
Here is my progress list:<P>
<B>Late December 2002</B>: First attempt was made at trying to<BR>
make the foreskin more elastic. <B>Not a very good attempt</B>.<BR>
Succeding requires <B>more force</B>, more time and, above all, <BR>
a correct stretching position. Don't stretch it by trying<BR>
to retract the foreskin: you must <P>
* PULL it AWAY from the stomach,<BR>
* insert 2-3-4 fingers inside, <BR>
* locate the tight area of the foreskin,<BR>
* and expand it from within. <P>
<B>EARLY JANUARY 2003</B>: A new attempt was made by me. Use of<BR>
   Q-tips was utilized. I saw a small part of my glans for<BR>
   the first time!<P>
<B>LATE JANUARY 2003</B>: <B>I gave up</B>. I didn't get any further than<BR>
   my original success of exposing the glans. It seemed that<BR>
   the effects of the stretching I made <B>vanished</B> the following<BR>
   day.<P>
<B>FEBRUARY 2003</B>: I somehow reached goal v0.8. Suddenly, I found myself<BR>
   sitting several HOURS every day, sitting still on my bed, watching<BR>
   the sun move slowly across my window, with sweat running down my<BR>
   body, stretching my foreskin FROM THE INSIDE with the help of fingers.<P>
   At that time I was <B>a reclusive, lone, computer nerd</B> (I am no longer<BR>
   that: 2004 was a very social year for me, with lots of buddies and,<BR>
   for the first time in my life, a girlfriend/<B>sex</B> partner).<P>
   So I had plenty of time to stretch, and that's exactly what I did!<P>
<B>MARCH 2003</B>:  I think it was first in this month that I was able to <BR>
   use three, then later FOUR fingers to stretch. That's how elastic<BR>
   it started to become. Also, I believe it was this month (or maybe<BR>
   April) when I for the first time FULLY retracted the foreskin behind<BR>
   the glans. I discovered a lot of <B>white stuff</B> behind the glans (<B>smegma</B>), and washed it away with water. It has probably been there for      <B>several years</B>.<P>
   Oh, and of course it was no longer painful walking etc, because now I<BR>
   washed the glans after every time I peed. No more accumulation of urine<BR>
   from now on!<P>
<B>MAY 2003</B>: I don't think I've stretched using fingers after May 2003.<BR>
   I reaced my <B>goal v0.9</B>, where I could stretch by retracting the            foreskin something like <B>30 times</B> after each time I peed (this takes       almost no time at all, compared to stretching for hours using fingers)<P>
<B>AUGUST 2003</B>: I stopped washing my glans after every time I peed. It's<BR>
   not really necessary. For the first time in my life, I could<BR>
   "shake it off" properly, so that when I put my underwear back on,<BR>
   there would be no wet spots. <P>
Long before the <B>end of 2003</B>, I even stopped retracting the glans <B>20-30 </B> times after each time I went to the bathroom.<P>
But I wasn't sure I really achieved my goal, because several <BR>
   <B>problems/insecurities remained</B>. First of all, will the skin become<BR>
<B>tight again</B> after you stop stretching it?

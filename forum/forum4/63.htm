Hi Robin, <p>
Do a google search ( web and images ) for chordee and chordee repair also hypospadias and you will see what I am talking about. My grandson's penis does not have sufficent loose skin on the front, but he has a overly large dorsal hood. The good thing is that his urethra is in the proper place. His is nowhere near as severe as the photos on Google search, but nonetheless, to ensure a healthy self image and healthy sexual life, he does require repair. <br>
It is not frenulum breve, I must have miscommunicated what I was trying to say. Some of the excess skin from the back side will brought around to the front to make up for the lack of loose skin on the front.  I have copied and pasted this next blurb from a website to help you understand what I am talking about. <p>
"As in this case, severe forms of hypospadias are accompanied by shortening of the urethral groove that causes ventral tethering of the penis. This condition, called chordee, can be severe enough to make sexual function impossible." <p>
Hopefully this helps, I just wanted to be sure that parents of boys with a so called natural circumcision don't think there is nothing left to do, when in fact the boys may require corrective surgery. <p>
Thank you <p>
Melanie<p>

>Hi Melanie,<br>
>Thanks for your ideas, however Im quite suprised.<br>
>Natural circumcision USUALLY leaves the penis in the same condition as when surgically circumcised.<br>
>you say "the way his skin is now attached it would pull the penis into an arch if he did get an erection"<br>
>firstly litle boys have erections every day of their life, not just starting at puberty, ... ultra sound examinations show boys have erections in the womb. <br>
>More importantly from your description this is a problem with frenulum breve (a little piece of skin attached underneath and in the centre of the glans to the shaft of the penis) ... also when you say the skin must be clipped you indicate this diagnosis, because clipping is one method of treating frenulum breve.<br>
>I am afraid that in this subject the medical professionals are simply very confused over whether to circumcise or not and even specialists do not know all the simple answers. For example "Tying the frenulum" cures it without any anaesthetic ... However as long as it is treated in some way then Im sure he will grow up safe and happy.<br>
>Maybe you would like to check my diagnosis with the mother of the child. Further info can be found through www.male-initiation.net/frenulum_index.html<br>

>>I saw the following message and I wanted to reply:<br>
>>I happened upon your website as I was doing homework for my human development class. I have three boys - 3 1/2 yr. old twins (identical/mirrored) and a two yr. old.<br>
>>They are all uncircumcised (but my husband is circumcised) - and I have a few questions that my family doctor hasn't been able to make clear for me. The youngest has what I guess is called a "natural circumcision" - he has very little foreskin, and nothing is obstructed (he can urinate fine). Is there anything that I should be aware of in his development with this condition?<br>
>>My reply:<br>
>>My grandson was born with a "natural circumcision" and he will need to undergo a surgical circumcision when he reaches 6 months of age. The reason for this is because the "natural circumcision" is actually a birth defect. The specialist said if his penis is not corrected, then he will never have a proper erection, and sex would never happen for him. He would be impotent because the way his skin is now attached it would pull the penis into an arch if he did get an erection. The skin must be clipped and allow the penis to stand up properly with erection. He must be 6 months old because he must go under anasthesia for the procedure. I would just say, have a specialist check your son to ensure he will be ok as an adult. Just some friendly advice.  :~)<br>

>>>>>> JB  here  <p>
 I  amy  sound  like  a    anti  circ  person    mainly  due  to  the  fact  i  was circed  and  regret  it.   Not  sure  if  iam  correct  in  saying that  its  the  only  way  to  go    there  are   good  in  both  i  guess.   I  just  was  not  asked   about  my   status   when  it  happend.    maybe  a  forum  for  the   Anti  Circ  folks    and  the  Pro Circ  folks    where  they  can  air  there  thoughts  and  let  the    ones  who  are  uncut  decide .   thats  a thought  .    again  EDUCATION <p>

  I  have  also  heard  of  sites   where  there  are  uncut  guys   who  wish  to  like   or  be  cut   but  not  really  sure .  I   know  for  a fact  the  Porno  Industry   katers  to  guys  who  are  cut  hence     everyone   thinks  you  have  to  be  cut  to  enjoy  sex   ..  Not  the  case. And  there   been  magazines   out  who  are  getting  more  uncuts   exposed  in  the magazines    now  as  well .    I  am  with  you   more   research  needs   to  be  done       whats  the     sensation   of  guys    cut  vs   uncut  and  how  that  affext  sex  .  Sexology  magazine    used   to  cover  a  lot of  old   medical  info.   not  sure  if  there  still  in  print  now    i  belive  the  format  has  changes   a  lot  in  ther  last  issues  i  read      10   or  15  yrs  ago .   the   www.nocirc.org  is   one  who  has  a  lot of  info  on  the  care of  uncut   childern    but    they  also  can  use   help   or  a  linkl to  your  site  for  more  info.    and guys  who  are  cut  and  want  restoration    can  go  to   www.noharmm.org   for  that   info  and  a  link  there   would  be  good   for    guys  who  want  just  learn  mor  about  foreskins  in  general   . <p>

<p>
I  go  along  with  taht   idea  as  well   but  remember   a  lot of  us  grow  at  different  rates.   I  understand  that  in  Europe     at  there  schools  the   doctor  checks  on  the  progress  each  year  and   if  nothing  is  done   and  some  boys   naturally    are  tight    need   to  take  on  more  agressive    methods    short of  Cutting  it  off.    and  for  those  who  wish  to  be   cut     maybe  teach  them  to  just  pull  it  back  and   try  to  hold  it  or  ware  it  pulled   back    i   do  know  the  frenum   also  makes  a  difference  if it  stays   back  or  not  as  well   that  is  better  than  a  total  circ as i  see  it  and  they  have  the  best  of  both  worlds     if  they  want  it   back  that  have  it  if  not  they   ware  it  pulled   back   no  loss  of  nerves   with  cutting   .    I  also   hear  hat  some  boys   just  mature  later  in life   and  it  dosent  release  until  there  in  there  teens  .    But  my  question  is    so   what    what  if  it  dosent  ever  pull  back   whats     wrong  with  that  as  well     that  i  need   to learn  as  well  and  there  is  NO  infor  on  what  that  feels  like   at  all     so  the  phimosed   guys   need   to  speak  up  on  that  experience  as  well    not  the  usual   oh it  feels  ok  ?

 I  will  go  along  with   what  you  say   Yes  there  needs  to  be  more   mention  of  all  this  info  that  kept a  deep  dark  secret.   Cut  (circumcised  guys)   dont  know   and    well    i  always  said   "YOU CANT ASK FOR  SOMETHING IF YOU DONT KNOW  ITS  THERE"  I Kinda fell  into  this  site  all  by  accident . I  learned  a lot  by  reading  the  conditions    guys  with   phimosed    penises  have  .  I  was  Cut  at  birth  and  did  not  know   anything  about  it  until  i was  almost a  teen  my  self.<p>

>With your anger-energy, people like you should be in control of ARC ... at least temporarily. Will your anger last? Or will you burn out soon? Whatever, for a period of time  – let me ask you what do we need to do to acheive our goal?<p>
#1  What does your anger-energy want to see done? And how? <br>
#2 Whats your opinion on lots of things:<br>
#3 Routine circ? Full circ? Is full circ ever necessary? The anti pro circ debate? The other phimosis foreskin info online?<p>
>>>>>>>>JB <p>
 Oh  boy  what a  loaded   question    #1   what  my  anger  want  to  to  see  happen /done .     Teach Parents    to  leave   children   intact  for  one   and   the  proper care of an  intact  penis   for  another..  thru  programs   like  the  one  here   and   also  like  the   programs  that   Marylin Malos    has    with  NOCIRC  Attend the  sysposiums  like  the  one  that   taking  place  in   Washing  state this    past  week.   also  work  with   guys    like  Jim  bigelow    the  author  of   "THE JOY OF  UNCIRCUMSING"   and   Wayne  R Griffith    NOHARMM  group    who   help  men   thru  education  regain  what was  taken  away  from  them  and   PROPER  CARE as  well .<p>
#2  Whats  my opinon about  Circumcision   or  intact   penises   .  I   feel  we  should   follow  the  example   of the  UK   United Kindom  and  the  countries    like   Norway  and  Sweden   and  Finland   and  the   RUSSIA   were   they  were   all  uncut    they   have  the  knowledge   there  doctors  on  how  to  take  care of  problems  if  any .  Canada  is   following  along  the  lines   with  the  UK  and   the  folks  down  under   in  the  big  island    as  well .  Its  said  that  80%  of  the  world s population  is  uncut   its  the   radical  middle  east  countries   and  the  US  who   cut  all  there  Children   now  a  study  should  be  done   that  proves  that  circumcision  in  babies   caused    violance   as  they  get  older  in  childhood   and  adult  hood   and  thats  why  we  see  the  fighting   that  we  do  but  there  been   no  real  study   showing  a   connection  to  childhood   Circs   and   behavor  and   fighting    Violance ....  <p>
#3    Routine Circs you  ask   my  answer   is   NO  follow   the  UK  example   No  circs.  and  Full  circ ?   that  answer  is   also  no    only  limited  circs   if  that!  and   is    circ   needed   i  say  only  in  rare     conditions    but   weigh  all  the  options   first  is  it  life   saving  at  all ?    The   And  the   anti/pro circ debate, i see it as Your choice   only  and   you  cannot  force   anyone  else  into  doing  it  with  out  giving  ALL  the    info    pro and  con.    short  term  and  long  term  results  as  well    and  thats  EDUCATION  .   Our  job  here   !<p>

>Lets get on the point – the goal : educating a medical world.<br>
>The simplest most direct and efficient method of tackling the problem at the roots is by publishing papers in the medical journals. (this is my opinion, other ideas would be appreciated). Id love to write such papers.<br>
>I believe I have done all the background research, I believe the info. on my site is only 50% well presented and easily accessible, Id like to spend more time on this. But communications and handling email takes a lot of time as well.<p>
>>>>>>>>JB   <p>
E mails does take a lot of time and its almost a full time job as well .  and if your  not getting paid to  do  that job its hard to pay bills as well. Your comment on papers  is  great  But our target audiance dosent get to read the  medical journals. i have tried  an many a hospital to  get into there technical librarys  and the general public is not allowed  its  like  you  dont  have a need  to  know  only our doctors  do   and  when do  they have the  time  to  read  every paper that comes  along??   the medical systemhere where i  live  is  in such bad  shape  and  no  help is in  site . dont  walk into an  ER  for  help   it  will take   about 24  hours  waiting to be helped in the  bigger  cities    and i  the  smaller  towns    God  help  you  first  as its  a  48 hour  hold or Wait. I see  sites like  this  one  where   parents  can  get  info    also  the  birthing    sites   or   mothers  magazines  and   Home  birthing  groups   there the  ones  who  need  to  know  the    truth    no  so  much on   circumcising  the  child   but  info  on  care of  an intact  penis   and   how  to  later  in life  as  well.   Again   hospitals   are good   dont  get  me  wrong  but  the  target audiance  is  not the  doctors   but the  parents    the  new   students  who are becoming nurses  and  doctors   who need  to  know   make  that     where  Universities  know    especially  in  there  books  and  lesson  plans  the  proper care.    web  sites  also  that  cater  to  a  population  that   well  is    not  maybe  on  everyone  list of  the  top 10  but  the  gay  sites   as  well     because there    using  it  and     deal  with it All  the  time    the  proper  care of  the  ADULT   Penis     or  at  least  let  them  know  its  there  .    web  sites  groups   associations .  I  will, us e an  example   there  was  three  Nurses  at  ST  VINCENT Hospital  in  New  mexico   who  refused   to  help  prep  babies  for  circumcision  because  the  trama  they  experienced    due  to  circumcisions .  Do  most  parents  know  of  that  trama   I  venture to  say  NOT. and   so   if  out  of site  out of  mind    and  so  why  not   its  only    what  300$   or   3,000 $     and  its  cleaner  I  dont  have  to  bother  ith  it  later   so  mom  says  .  But  its   not  her  problem  she  dosent  know   or  see  or feel  the   results   its  not  her  body  thats   cut    whom  acres   what   we  do  to  others    and  in such  a  sensitive  area       as well   thats  your  problem  as  mom  see  it  .   well  the  nurses   had  a  book  written    called    "THE NURSES OF ST VINCENT HOSPITAL"    and   NOCIRC  and  Marylin  Who  by  the  way  also  went  thru  the  sam   rejection   at  the  hospital  she  worked  at.  These    are  the  folks   who  we  need   to  contact  and  network  with   they   get  out  and  do    the    ground  pounding   at  least   thru    the  NO Circ  network    in  cities   through  the  US  and  Europe  as  well  .  they  have  a  large  network  with   news  letters   and    publications     and   guys  like  Tim  Hammond   and  Jim  bigelow     and  the  joy of  uncircumcising  book  they  wrote   these   are  the  folks  we  need   to  network  with  the  nurses  and   guys  who  sufferd  the  circ  and  are  trying  to  teach  the    no  circ  method   but  need  your  help  in  care  of  uncuts   as  well. <p>

 as  Capt. Perry  said  on  the  old  sailing  ship  on  Lake  Erie   just  off  the  coast of  what  is  now    Canada   and  the  state  of  Ohio     quote "DONT GIVE UP  THE  SHIP"    after  all   its   only  been    6  months   to  a  year  i  know  of  your  efforts    and   you  say  no  one  supports  me    I  know  that  feeling   I  been  trying  to  get   folks  to  stop  circumcisions    ever since    1976    and i  gotten  no  support    or monies   at  all  .  I  have  printed  flyers    even  done   talks  and   videos   for  tv   use   but  thats  all  out of  my  pocket   so  YES  been  ther  done  that    Dont  give  up  the    ship/ effort.    Russel  zanger   Bless  his  soul   i  sure  he  passed  on  now    but  talk  about  a  supporter  of  nocirc  publications     and   efforts   to  educate  the  public    go far  beyond   what  most  would  ever  think  of  .    but    groups  like   NOCIRC   and  Marylin   Malos  and  the   sites    and    groups   around  this   country   the  USA    have  made a  difference     be  it  at  ST  Vincents   Hospital  in  Santa  Fe  New  mexico USA   or  else  ware .  One  reason  the     intact  population  has  grown  in  california  is  the  Hispanics   dont  belive  in  circing  there  babies    and  the  southern  states   like  Arizona  and  NM   and  parts  of  Texas   have  a  huge    hispanic  mexican    culture     stemed  from  the  Spanish    in  EUROPE   who  dont  Circ    but    remember  there  under  that  care of   US  doctors   who  like  to  make  $$$  and   if  a  kid   has  a  problem  they   dont  know  how  to  care  for  it    except  to  cut  it  off .    there  mind   set  is  if  you  have  a  hang  nail  cut  off the finger  that  will  cure  it  from  coming  back  .  Thats  OUR  medical    training  here as  to   penises  .   <p>

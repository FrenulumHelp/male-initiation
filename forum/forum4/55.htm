 I  was   Cut  at  birth     but  many  Americans   also  were  cut   do  to  the   lack of  knowledge  or  the  idea  that   a  uncut  penis    might  (2%)  get  cancer   so  its  better  to  cut  the  foreskin  off.    Not  mentioning  that   a   greater  precent  of  the  sensation     and   between   80  and 90 %  of  the  nerves   were  cut  away  during  Circumcisions.    I   and   i    have  seen     many  Americans     are  also  angry    due  to  the  fact  we  had  no  choice   as  to   what    we  could  have    Cut  vs   uncut or  intact   penises..  <p>

Hay  i  am  with  you  on  that  topic    there  is  a  question  i  do  have    and   it  also  relates  back  to    guys   like  you  who  have  a  foreskin .   I  have  ask   well  what  it  like     any    down  sides  to  sporting  such  as  a  foreskin.   What   pro/con  info  can  you give  me  about  what  you  have  and    i  get  the   general  pat answer  its  ok  or   nothing  is   wrong.   I  happend  to  be  talking  to  a  guy  who  is  cut  and  he  said    uncuts    have  a  lot of  maintance   associated  with  foreskins   but   try  and  get  that  out of  some  one  who  is  uncut  and  the  answer is   what?  I  guess the better way to ask it is   what  it  like  to  be  phimosed    are  there down  sides  to   not  being able  to  pull  it  back?  and  if  so  what  are  they.     <br>

>I am university educated as a health professional, and nowhere in ANY of my years of study did the condition “phimosis” ever get even a fleeting mention. If it doesn’t even get a mention at this level, what hope do 13-year-old kids get... until perhaps they’re near to 30 years of age after years of sexual (and social) insecurities.(Of course the age-related impotence was awarded significant lecture time at university...<p>
>>>>>> JB   <p>
  You  said    something  there   that  also  hit a  cord    in  my  train  of  thought   13 year olds  and  years of social insecurities.....  what  insecurities  are there!  or  fears   and  again  something   not  mentioned  is  the    connection  to  the  fact  that the  EXPOSED gland  looses  a  significant  amount of  sensation  soon  after  the    teen years   in  the   young  13  year old  penis.  so  by    age  29  or   30    on a  scale  of  1 to 10     with 10    at  the  best 1  being  at  the  bottom     males  who  are  circed   fall  below  the  1  mark  into  a  minus    range   down  to  a  - minus   or  negitive    30  to  50    bu  the  time  they  reach  80  yrs  of  age.   no  wonder  the  drug companies like  circed  guys    $$$$  .   Oh  did  i  mention    if   the  doctors   who  are " to  cause  no  harm "   do more damage  than  not   in  circumcising    the  males    and  thats  to  the  tune  of  between  300 US  Dollars     up  to  as  much  in some  cases    3,000 us  dollars .  and  i  hear  the  operation  done  on  babies  is   what  10  minutes   worth of  work.    ok  nursed   i  have  a rolls     to  pay  off . thats    6  in an  hour   at  3,000 $  US   and  i  do  that  for    8  hours i  could  have  that  car  paid  off  in  a   very  short  order  correct....    not  to  mention  the   treatment   in  old  age   for    ED   erection  disfuntion  partly due  to   no  sensation caused  by  me   circumcising  him    or  a  co  worker  80  yrs  hence . <br>
  <br>
<<<<<<<<<TIM<p>
 God forbid 80 year old men lose their erections after a lifetime of sexual satisfaction).I am absolutely incensed! What a completely distorted world we live in!<br>
>I referred back to my university notes, and the closest thing that came to the subject was the matter of ensuring uncircumsized males wash their glans to prevent infection... no elaboration (Not sure if my University has lower standards than expected - but it’s supposed to be in the top two to three in the country). I even went to the Merck Manual (a thorough, world-renowned reference book on medical conditions and treatments) - where “phimosis” gets merely a tiny paragraph, stating “surgical circumcision is indicated” and “prognosis is excellent”.<p>
>>>>>>> JB    <p>
 Again   should  i  mention    the  car   (rolls  )  i am  paying  off,     more  $$$     and  yes  id  be  happy   to  cut  off  your  foreskin   and  cause  you  to  loose  the  pleasures  {you  had}   with the  foreskin .  Or   will  have  if  i  show  you  how   to  get  it  to  where it  would  retract   and  save   all  the   sensation    normally  lost  with  circumcision.... <p>
<<<<<<< Tim  <p>
>I don’t think I’ve ever been so angry about anything before!<p>
>>>>>>>>JB   <p>
Angry  !   wow  what an  understatement   I  was   aware  about   circumcisions   nor    what a  foreskin was  until  i   was  10  yrs  of  age. and  that was all by accident  that i found out! no  mention was  evermade  or  explained  to  me  about  this  topic. and  in  years   later     i  find  out  what was  taken away from me  and  the   HARM done  due  to  circumcision.<p>
<<<<<<<Tim<p>
>There are certainly many ""issues ""associated with this condition, but as far as I can see, the greatest is the fact that young boys are not educated about this condition. From what I remember, my teenage sex education in high school focused on not spreading STDs and preventing unwanted pregnancies. I guess boys who’s foreskins prevented them from having sex didn’t pose as much as much of a social (or economical) threat to the community as some of these other things, so it really got demoted down the list of priorities on what to educate kids about (demoted down to no mention at all).<p>
>>>>>> JB   <p>
Tim  there  again   you mention  that   non education  is  the  key  factor  in that  many  mothers  / parents    as  well as  youth  are  not  educated  in  the  proper care  and   usefulness of  the foreskin  the  real reason  it  was   ment  to  be!  You  mentioned,your foreskin prevented you from having sex  as  a  teen   and there  are  issues  associated with  being uncut  but some  one who  is   cut ask the   question   WHAT ARE THE ""ISSUES""  associated with  being  uncut  and   we get  no  answers.  thats  my  complaint  and  there is  nothing  said   But  behind our  backs    we  hear   phimoses   tight skins   or    worse yet  infections   or   the    smegma  delema  and  maintance  associated with foreskins  .  but  ask  one  and  you  get    the  pat answer   i  have  no  problems .  I  with  you  i  REALLY  glad  this  site  is  here  .   I  know    as  i   write  this   the   International  sysposium  of   circumcision   has  taken place  in   Washing  state  in  trying  to  educate  those   to   dont  know  the     reason  its  better  to   leave  the  newborns intact  and   deal  with    problems  that  come  up   short  of  the   cure all  cut  it  off.  now  if  there is  any way i  can help  please  let me  know . Tim  and  others, e  mail  me   please.<p>

>My hat goes off to this website. It’s done so much more in a matter of minutes than what a lifetime of supposed “education” has done. And I concur (with other posts) that something needs to be done to ensure young kids are made aware of this condition.<br>

 several  sites    one  is www.nocirc.org   another  is www.noharmm.org and  still  another    here  in  the  USA  is  a  movement  like  what  was  done  in  the   UK   United Kindom    back  in  1962    and  that  was  the  hault  of  circumcisions  on  all   boys   reguardless  of  age .  that  web  site  is    www.mgmbill.org  there  are    groups    in  the  UK  as  well  who  are  in support  of  just  such  an  effort. Something  i  may  also  mention    Yes   i  know  there  are  guys   and  you  may   be  one  as  well   who  support  Circumcisions and  the  feelind     they  recive  are   great    as  an  adult  after  the  operation   wow    the  best  ever    (FOR NOW)   but  i  also  talked  to    a  few   who    were  Phimosed     One    in mind  is     in  PHOENIX AZ  with  NOCIRC  chapter  there    a  fella  by  the   name  of ROOD.   he  was  Phimosed   Like  you  Tim  and   did  not  know   you   were  to pull  it  back   he  could  not    and   was  talked  into  circumcision   (REMEMBER  THE  CURE ALL CUT  IT )    well  now   he   wishes he   was  just  left alone   and   so  many  other  uncuts   who   thought  the  grass  was  greener  on  the  other  side  only  to  find  out  NO  its  not!    have  now   gotten  the  Book   by  Jim  Bigelow ,  ( great  person  to  work  and  talk  with  )    called    ""THE JOY OF  UNCIRCUMCISION""    and  it  can  be  ordered  thru  no circ   as  well as    Border books     and   amazon and    all  the  other   big  book  stores  .  another   good  book   with  history  is   one   by   Bud Berkely , ""FORESKIN""     and  it  last  i  known of  had  two  printings    but  may  now  be  out of  print  good  reading   for  all  students    in  the  medical  field     general  practice and  fields  realted  to   urilogy and such.      signed  JB

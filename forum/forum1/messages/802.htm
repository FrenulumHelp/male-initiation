Well, sorry.  I didn't realize it was so touchy.  I have known only two guys in my whole life who had just one.  One was a Lithuanian Jew who lost one of his gonads during routine circumcision, and he laughed about it.  Actually, he boasted about it.  The other had one removed because it became cancerous, and got the implant to replace it.  All the rest of us made jokes about it at the card table, and it didn't bother him.  Knowing that one works as well as two, I doubt it would bother me, and I find it almost unfathomable that there are enough men uncomfortable with such a thing to form a support group.  What, do all three of them fly in to one spot on the globe for the meetings?

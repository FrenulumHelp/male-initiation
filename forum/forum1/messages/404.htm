Yeah thanks man...i guess it isnt that bad.  Did you get yours fixed?  is it back to normal and as strong as it was before? Im not a doctor, but couldnt they just cut it at the tip and cut a slit where it is suppose to be, then stich it back together?  Yeah and when you got it fixed(if you did) did you pay for it or did it go to your parents...My problem is that I wouldnt have wanted my mom to know about it because then she would ban me from my girl.  I dont plan to have sex.  I wouldnt even call what we were doing sex or even "dry humping"  well i was just wondering...maybe you could even get the piece of skin cut off like the part that ripped? Is that possible?  <P>
Thanks for the response man...

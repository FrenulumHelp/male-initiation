  <P> I was younger than you when I decided I wanted the same thing. I read about 
    boys and men with phimosis and it sounds like so much a problem I should be 
    happy that my skin was loose like yours. But the bad thing is that it would 
    not stay pulled back for a long time. I was happy to read that somebody has 
    found and put on websites new ways to make it work. I wish I had that when 
    I was younger. Don't give up trying, you will make it work and enjoy it better 
    pulled back all the time. </BLOCKQUOTE>

Hi Rob,<BR>
>I don't think there are any risks , although I can't say that I'm 100% <BR>
>certain .. <P>
It is 100% risk free, <BR>
- the only thing uncertain is if its safe to use with  under 3 yr. olds<P>
>Personally I've been using betamethasone for a month now .... <BR>
obviously different cases take different times, but you sound happy with the progress ..<BR>
_____________<BR>
>>I have heard about these creams....and on one site (such as the stretching technique site) someone mentioned theres some risks with using cream.  Is this true--is it safe to use it? <P>
Now I wonder if the "stretching technique site" refers to my humble contribution, if so then the only report of danger came from a guy using hydrocortisone and if I remember correctly he had LSA as well.<P>
Now Roxane,<BR>
If I`ve digested the info. correctly, kenalog is milder than betamathasone, ... kenalog was developed for mouth ulcers, so if it doesn`t harm the (sensitive) mouth then it wont harm the outer foreskin.<P>
Ask your doctor, <BR>
or maybe you can even get them over the counter without prescription ... ?<BR>
Robin<P>
betamethasone 0.5 -- or presumably can be 100% guaranteed as safe, ask your doctor ...<BR>
Celestone-V (betamethasone valerate equivalent to betamethasone 0.5 mg/g)
  <P> Kenalog <BR>
    (Triacinolone Acetonide .1% - corticosteroid, anti-inflammmatory, <BR>
    anti-pruritic cream)

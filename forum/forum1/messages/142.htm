'Origins of a Taboo' - an excellent site. Just what I've been looking for over recent weeks to help with my 'problem'.<P>
Having read much of the material on the site, I think I may have Frenulum Breve. <P>
Can anyone recommend a good consultant to discuss my problem with (in London, preferably, but other parts of UK fine also) which could lead to corrective surgery (Frenuloplasty)?<P>
Also, are there any other 'Frenulum Breve' sufferers who also suffer from a 'shrivelled looking' penis because of the foreskin overhang when the penis is flacid? In particular, the problem seems to be exacerbated after playing sport, which makes the communal shower an embarassing ordeal?

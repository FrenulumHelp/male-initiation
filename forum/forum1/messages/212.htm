Joe, one thing you haven't said is, whether your<BR>
foreskin will remain retracted when you push it back<BR>
behind the glans.  If it will, you might try leaving<BR>
it back (retracted) for a day or two which ought to<BR>
promote some desensitization of the glans.  Of course<BR>
you will need to avoid touching the exposed glans<BR>
(probably including sleeping on it!) until it becomes<BR>
less sensitive; it may help to wrap it in gauze which<BR>
will allow it to dry out to some degree but will<BR>
protect it from further contact with clothing or any<BR>
other type of touching. You might find that keeping<BR>
the foreskin permanently retracted will keep things as<BR>
you like them, as well as promoting cleanliness. (It's<BR>
interesting that many opponents of circumcision<BR>
deplore what they consider to be a resultant loss of <BR>
sensitivity, while your current problem appears to be<BR>
just the opposite.) On the other hand, if your<BR>
foreskin can not be kept retracted on its own, you<BR>
might try pushing it all the way back and taping it so<BR>
it stays in that position, and keeping it exposed to<BR>
the air until it becomes a little less sensitive<BR>
(probably a couple of days; you can determine for<BR>
yourself when the desired degree of insensitivity is<BR>
reached).  Another idea, which Robin Stuart suggested<BR>
some time back,  is to soak the penis (with glans<BR>
uncovered)in a Nescafe jar that contains warm water<BR>
for some minutes. He also was looking for a magic<BR>
ingredient to add to the water to promote<BR>
keritanisation (development of protective covering<BR>
tissue):  I suggest strong tea which contains tannins<BR>
& thus may promote thickening of the glans's covering<BR>
membrane.  If you do this, however, it is important to<BR>
rinse all the tea away and dry the glans carefully<BR>
before you return the foreskin to its forward<BR>
position.  I don't think you would want to trap any<BR>
chemical substance, including tannin-containing tea,<BR>
under the foreskin next to the glans.<BR>
I think your advice re stretching the foreskin until<BR>
it can be easily retracted is well-conceived & ought<BR>
to be followed by any man or boy who has trouble with<BR>
phimosis:  in my opinion (shared by many!) it is not a<BR>
good thing to have a tight, unretractible foreskin<BR>
covering the glans at all times & thus permitting dirt<BR>
to be trapped where it can not easily be removed. <BR>
Penile cancer is admittedly a rare disease but<BR>
anything that could promote it (like a chronically<BR>
dirty glans) ought to be avoided.  (That's not scare<BR>
talk, just good sense!)  <BR>
You've already done the hard work in loosening up your<BR>
tight foreskin so it's retractible.  It ought to be<BR>
possible now to solve your sensitivity problem with a<BR>
minimum of hassle.  Good luck in ending it! Bob.<BR>
P.S.  Judging from recent correspondence, problems of<BR>
the sort you've dealt with seem to be common:  perhaps<BR>
the forum can be helpful to a good many people by<BR>
spreading helpful information about how to solve them<BR>
with minimal (or no) surgical intervention.  RJK.<P>

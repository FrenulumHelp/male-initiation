I guess you have "phimosis", a.k.a. tight foreskin. I had that too until I was 18 (I'm 19 now). I used a creme called "betamethasone .05%" for about 7-8 weeks. Before I started I couldnt even pull it back past the pee slit while soft. By the end of the 8 weeks I had total retraction even while erect!!!<BR>
Tell your doctor you have a rash and would like to use the creme if youre embarrased about it. Apply it once per day to the outside of your foreskin from the tip to about mid-glans (mid head). Email if you want and I'll see if I can help you out more.<BR>
Later,<BR>

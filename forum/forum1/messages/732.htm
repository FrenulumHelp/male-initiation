  <P> Ross, you say you have a lot of FS now, but what you don't say is that you 
    don't have the nerve-rich tip of your foreskin back, because that was cut 
    off at your circumcision and is gone. Also, you don't point out that it takes 
    a long, long time and a lot of tedious effort to stretch what's left of the 
    foreskin too any considerable length, and you have to think it over carefully 
    before you decide that a "restoration" (without the tip brought back)is worth 
    the time and effort involved. Of course you can in time restore the smegma 
    manufacturing and dirt-collecting ability that an uncut foreskin possesses, 
    making it necessary to resume the constant effort to keep the area clean that 
    may be a new experience if you were circumcised at birth. (And some wives 
    may not think this "restoration" is too great a thing.) Of course there are 
    trade-offs in many aspects of life. I would think it over long and carefully 
    before deciding to try any modifications in my clean, totally satisfactory 
    penis. Cheers, RJK.<BR>
    >I have bookmarked it though.<BR>
    >I have been restoring my foreskin for almost two years and am part of the 
    the largest FS restoration club on the internet.<BR>
    >I am forunate to have had it both ways so I and many cyber friends can speak 
    from some experience. I have a lot of FS now (not completely covered yet) 
    and enjoy it very much as does my wife.<BR>
    >The sensation during intercourse is phonominal for both partners. My wife 
    feels a big difference in the lack of friction and the over all feeling of 
    my penis. Because of that lack of friction I last a lot longer which gives 
    her the opportunity to reach her plateaus more often and more than once during 
    intercourse.<BR>
    >Before you cut off the extra skin under stand that it does serve a purpose, 
    if it didn't we wouldn't be born with it.

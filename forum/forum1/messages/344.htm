I have heard about these creams....and on one site (such as the stretching technique site) someone mentioned theres some risks with using cream.  Is this true--is it safe to use it?  Because I'd rather use the cream first (if it's safe and not risky).<P>

Hello Anthony,<BR>

>14 yrs. old at a guess in America --- I dont know what sort of parents permission if any is needed in the USA --- how very embarrassing for you - do you know a doctor who you like? can you speak with your parents? .. if both these fail, do you have a teacher who you like? <BR>
>If it comes to surgery I would suggest your simplest course is to be sure of your diagnosis (phimotic ring?) and then refuse everything but a minimal dorsal slit ... (which will remove the hindrance and when you are older and more able to confront the medical profis you could get cut to any shape or size you wish). <BR>
>The best suggestion when someone suggests circumcision is to throw a fit of hysterics :-) :-) - such behaviour is probably more effective if you`re young and unable to argue your case rationally - and at 14 you have rights to refuse any surgery you dont want.<BR>

&gt;Hello Anthony,
&gt;&gt;First this is not your &quot;fault&quot; for not stretching when you were younger, 
&gt;&gt;From your description I guess you have a phimotic ring, can you try gentle stretching as illustrated on &lt;a href=&quot;http://members.tripod.co.uk/origins/stretching.html#start&quot;&gt;stretching&lt;/A&gt;
&gt;&gt;14 yrs. old at a guess in America --- I dont know what sort of parents permission if any is needed in the USA --- how very embarrassing for you - do you know a doctor who you like? can you speak with your parents? .. if both these fail, do you have a teacher who you like? 
&gt;&gt;If it comes to surgery I would suggest your simplest course is to be sure of your diagnosis (phimotic ring?) and then refuse everything but a minimal dorsal slit ... (which will remove the hindrance and when you are older and more able to confront the medical profis you could get cut to any shape or size you wish). 
&gt;&gt;The best suggestion when someone suggests circumcision is to throw a fit of hysterics :-) :-) - such behaviour is probably more effective if you`re young and unable to argue your case rationally - and at 14 you have rights to refuse any surgery you dont want.
&gt;&gt;Hope that helps
&gt;&gt;Robin

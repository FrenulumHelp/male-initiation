>>I am an uncircumsized teenaged male, and am completely unable to retract my foreskin when my penis is erect<BR>
>>when flaccid, it can be retracted with ease, and I'm wondering how i can resolve or fix this problem.<BR>
>It seems that you may not have a serious problem since it will retract easily while flaccid. What happens when you retract and it gets erect? do you have a problem getting it back over the rim of the glans?<BR>
>I suspect that some gentle stretching may work wonders- just don't try to do it all at once. It may be that your frenulum is too short if it pulls the glans down when retracted- if so a fairly simple trimming of the frenulum where it attaches to the glans can release it a lot.<BR>
an addittional thought-- there is a web site www.foreskin.org which shows pictures of various frenulum types as well as some results of stretching- might be worthwhile to check for anyone seeking information<BR>
>Depending on your age- you may still be growing and the problem will be solved by merely stretching while masturbating over time.<BR>
>good luck

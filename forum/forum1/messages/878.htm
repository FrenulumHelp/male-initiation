 Oversensitivity can be a problem when the glans is covered most of the time. Desirable sensitivity for sexual response is actual enhanced by defusining this pain response by exposing th glans to air. This can be aided by taping or use of o rings to stabilize the foreskin behind the glans if necessary. When wearing the foreskin retracted can be attained all the benefits of a complete circumcision can be attained- such as better cleanliness, better disease rejection and great down to the nitty gritty orgasmic response.  More intacters should try it.

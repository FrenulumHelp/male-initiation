As an answer to: <A HREF="415.htm">Pinhole phimosis and partial circumcision</A> written by bernt at 18 May 2000 23:51:06:
  <P> Bernt, I don't think there's anything to be scared of although I suppose 
    it's natural when you're having a procedure done on something as important 
    as the penis. Don't worry about pain: this can be controlled with drugs and 
    probably will taper off in a week or less after the surgery. The newly-exposed 
    glans may be somewhat sensitive for a while, but the sensitivity will moderate 
    a good bit in short order. Be patient, and let things heal at their own pace. 
    It may take a month, but sooner or later excess sensitivity will dissipate 
    and your penis will feel totally normal. And be in great shape for sex. I 
    doubt that the pinhole phimosis will complicate things much, and getting rid 
    of it will no doubt relieve pressure on the bladder when urinating that might 
    in time lead to kidney problems. You may be scared now, but in 24 hours you'll 
    be on your way to a total recovery. Good luck! RJK.<BR>

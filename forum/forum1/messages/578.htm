Bill, it's a good idea to do something about your skin bridges now, so you can  eliminate them as a problem from now on. A urologist could take care of them in short order, or you could go to a plastic surgeon to have things set right.  Either of these courses of action would be private because the physician is bound to protect the confidentiality of his patients' problems, nooot pass the word about the community.  The correctional procedure in all likelihood will be done under local anaesthetic, and thus will be painless.  There may be some soreness for a few days afterward, until the separated tissues heal, but after that it will be well worth the little bit of pain (and, hopefully, no embarrassment!) you've undergone.  Best wishes, Bob.<BR>
>i'm 16 and have skin bridges on almost the entire right side of my penis. is there anything relatively painless and private i can do to correct this? should i just leave it alone?

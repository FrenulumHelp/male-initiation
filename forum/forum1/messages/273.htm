As an answer to: <A HREF="270.htm">Sore after sex?</A> written by Sandra at 17 Feb 2000 22:11:02:
  <P> If his foreskin retracts without difficulty it is not an anatomical problem 
    such as frenulem breve or phimosis. If he's not worried, I don't think you 
    should.<BR>
    All men experience sensitivity at some time or another.<BR>
    Perhaps a lubricant might help.<BR>

    >Is an uncircumcised male supposed to be sore after sex, even if slightly? 
    My boyfriend is, and I think it is odd. He will not do anything about it..

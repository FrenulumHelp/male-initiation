Try a topical steroid cream first before you agree to surgery of any kind.<BR>
It has a very high success rate. The one prescribed for my son (Kenalog 0.1%)<BR>
was very effective.
  <P> >Firstly I would like to thank Robin for such a well presented and imformative 
    site, keep up the good work, Its much appreciated.<BR>
    >It would appear that I fall into the category of a recently presented relative 
    phimosis. As such it would appear that my only options are surgical; my doctor 
    would only reccomended a full circumcision.<BR>
    >There doesnt seem to be much in the way of suggested causes for this type 
    of phimosis, If, as I suspect I will, I opt for a partial circ, it would be 
    nice to do all i can to prevent this from happening again.......<BR>
    >I would also like to ask, If i do end up with a full circ, is masturbation 
    without the topbit the same as with, surely it must rub...?<BR>
    >Regards<BR>

    >Robin : If I get a little more spare time I might contact you about helping 
    out with the admin...

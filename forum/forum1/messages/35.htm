>and look at drawing 4 ... the dark area is the outer foreskin ... look at the top picture, - I presume that in your case the point of the outer foreskin is almost directly connected with the apex of the "V" shape ... is there any space at all between outer foreskin and the "V" shape? in fact if this was the underside of your penis, the entire area of the shaft would be dark coloured ... <P>
Yep thats about it<P>
>>>circumcision is still a rather meaningless way of trying to cure this.<P>
>>I hope so<P>
>Well if I have now - above - described you correctly, then the main problem is frenulum breve, ... a frenuloplasty takes a half hour and can be performed by any urologist <P>
OK - sounds nasty but if it doesn't take long I guess it isn't - wish they give them less scary sounding names!<P>
>... as some degrees of phimosis are difficult to diagnose when flaccid especially when combined with frenulum breve then I would advise first getting the frenulum seen to and then you would be able to see clearly if you have any degree of phimosis ...<P>
I am sure there is phimosis as the opening just isn't big enough to roll back at all when the penis is anything more than flaccid - and if I have it rolled back and I get and erection its not a very pleasant feeling and there quite a narrowing right behind the head<P>
>the next question should be which area in the UK ... (see if we can find you a contact or a good urologist - no promises but it might be worth a try)<P>
I'm Gloucestershire - within easy traveling distance of Bristol, Swindon, Birmingham and Oxford <P>

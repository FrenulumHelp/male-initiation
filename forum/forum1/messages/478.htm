As an answer to: <A HREF="199.htm">Extra Sensetive Head</A> written by Joe at 14 Jan 2000 05:24:57:<P>
Hi I'm a 17 yr old male and I believe that I have got an extra sensitive head as well. I have always had it, since I can remember but never had it seen to or mentioned anything to my parent because I thought that it was normal. I can't really remember now but I think that I had some trouble with my foreskin being to tight when I was younger, and I never used to pull it back. I can remember not being able to pull it back when aroused due to it being to tight, but I stretched it a while back. I got fed up of not being able to pull it back (I started masturbating at an early age, about 10 yrs old) so I started pulling it back slightly every time I got aroused as it wasn't tight at all when I wasn't.<BR>
I can't remember how long it took, but for a few years I've been able to pull it back with no trouble at all. The only problem I have left now is that I have got a really sensitive head, and until now have not heard about anything like phimosis. I realise now that this is probably what I had as a small child. I suppose that this is the problem we've got with it not being a known thing among parents. Anyway, I just wanted to have my say, and its nice to know that this does happen to other people. <BR>
BTW my foreskin stays up when I pull it back when aroused, but not when I am not aroused. So what do you think I should do to desensitise my penis head? Just leave it uncovered? Sometimes I can masturbate without my foreskin but with plenty of lubricant and only when I am very aroused. I hope this will get better soon because I am in the middle of a quite serious relationship and sex is probable, so you can see why this is worrying me now. Does anyone know of a web site or somewhere I could get more information on this? And is there a medical name for this condition?<BR>
Any reply will be very appreciated. <BR>
Thank you for your time.<BR>
Lee<P>

As an answer to: <A HREF="499.htm">Frenulum and sexuality changes</A> written by PS at 16 Jul 2000 14:47:37:
  <P> >I had a normal (not too short/breve) intact frenulum; I injured it by mistake 
    because of a "tear with the fingernails" a delirious night. I made sex before 
    and I felt a very sensitive enjoyment in the area on the top or/and the underside 
    of the glans. After the frenectomy it seems to me I never felt this enjoyment 
    anymore: I would like to know if it is only a psychological feeling or this 
    very sensitive area is on the ventral glans and the frenulum is like the inner 
    layer tissue and anything else more.<BR>
    >The CIRP (circumcision information resources pages) explain the normal frenulum 
    is important for the male orgasm because of the many nerves endings important 
    triggers of the orgasm / contains blood vessels to erogate the glans / the 
    stretch receptors contribute to the enjoyment and maybe to the ejaculation 
    system/reflex.<BR>
    >My question to You is:<BR>
    >What do you thing about?<BR>
    >Do you know any experiences about this subject (private testimonials)?<BR>

    I don't know where you can find any proven answers, and human anatomy is so 
    varied that we may not all react the same way, but speaking from personal 
    experience I would say that it is not simply psychological. A normal frenulum 
    does have considerable sensitivity and is involved in one's reaching organism. 
    As a personal note, when I was circumcised much more external foreskin was 
    removed than internal (mucosa). I think this preserved a good bit of the nerves 
    that are important to sexual functioning. I know the frenum was not cut at 
    all, since it is well back of the line where the circumcision was made. I 
    know, too, that by gently rubbing the frenulum and nearby regions with the 
    index finger I can stimulate considerable feeling which will lead to sexual 
    arousal. This same area is more sensitive than the rest of the penis and is 
    definitely involved in reaching orgasm. Somewhere I read once that circumcision 
    is followed by increased sensitivity of the frenulum. I doubt this, but believe 
    that the frenulum, remaining after other tissue has been cut away, may seem 
    to be more sensitive than it was before. I don't believe the guys who report 
    having had the frenulum removed when they were circumcised did themselves 
    a good service, because I can't imagine how they can achieve a normal orgasm 
    unless there are a few frenular nerves left which can act to promote orgasm. 
    Certainly in the traditional Jewish circumcision and in clamp and plastibell 
    circumcisions the frenulum is not removed or damaged, and this is no doubt 
    one reason most circumcised men can reach orgasm without any obvious problem 
    when they have sex. In your own case, I don't know why your torn frenulum 
    upon healing did not return to normal sensitivity since, from what you say, 
    no frenulum was removed. I would say your damaged sensitivity is the exception 
    rather than the norm, but this is based largely on guesswork; I don't know 
    what one should expect here. If you can manage to find a neurologist who will 
    examine the torn area, you may be able to get help in restoring normal sensitivity. 
    Good luck! RJK. </BLOCKQUOTE>

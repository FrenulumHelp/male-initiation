As an answer to: <A HREF="860.htm">Circumcision</A> written by Jim at 30 Dec 2000 00:26:37:<P>
>Following my frenuloplasty that has proved relatively unsucessful my doctor has recommended circumcision. What should I do? Although my forskin is no-longer as tight I am unsure whether the results are good enough. So if I have the circumcision how will it affect me? I am worried it will affect my sex life as I cant imagine sex being comfortable or pleeasurable without a forskin. Can anyone help me decide?<P>
You haven't said what the problem was before and what results you've obtained by your frenolum removal.  What was it you were trying to achieve and why does your doctor think it wasn't successful and that you need to be cut.<P>
I'm like you, I can't imagine sex without my foreskin even if I am kinda tight.  Like John told you, you can always get cut.

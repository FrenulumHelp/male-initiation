my son is 4 years old he was circumcised when he was a baby his foreskin is stuck to the head of his penis when i pull it back i can see the top of the head but it wont pull back enough to see the whole rim of it it has been this way for as long as i can remember i have worried about it but i have ask other people in my family about it and if i should take him to the doctor about it but they all tell me it will take care of its self  im afraid if i do take him to the doctor the will want to recircumcise him  he dosent have any trouble with it right now but im afraid he will when he is older if any one could tell me what would be the best thing to do it would very helpful .

>------------------------------------------------------<P>
you dont say why it wont retract or what problems you have, so we could guess that if you dont do anything to change your situation then it`ll stay pretty much the same as it is now.<P>
I could also guess from the sense of vagueness in your description with no conscious difficulty that this indicates a full phimosis (this is not a personal insult, vagueness is a common symptom) -------- and for phimosis then betamethasone or a minimal dorsal slit are admirable modern all cure options<P>
please read other threads and<BR>

  <P> Paul St. John, of St. John Neuromuscular Pain Relief Seminars, has had success 
    treating Peyronie's, as well as a variety of other genital pain problems including 
    infertility related to low sperm count. If you are interested in contacting 
    him check out his seminar website: stjohnnmtseminars. They can give you his 
    clinic phone number, and/or you can ask for names of Certified St. John <BR>
    Neuromuscular therapists nearer you than his home base in Florida. Certified 
    therapists are scattered around this and several other countries, and about 
    a dozen of us are also instructors of the discipline. I have not had any clients 
    come to me with Peyronie's, but I have had patients with several manifestations 
    of genital pain -- so far it all seems to respond quite well to what we do, 
    which is to treat the small muscles of the pelvic floor and lower abdomen, 
    as well as correcting posture problems that may have caused these muscles 
    to tighten in the first place.<BR>
    The mechanism that muscles can cause genital pain may be better understood 
    if you are aware of symptoms of a heart attack: most commonly it causes chest 
    pain, radiating into the jaw and down the left arm. There is no nerve that 
    connects the heart to the jaw or left arm: this is an example of pain radiating 
    away from the causal point, also known as trigger point referrals. </BLOCKQUOTE>

As an answer to: <A HREF="197.htm">Re: Phimosis and Penile Growth</A> written by Roxane at 13 Jan 2000 16:16:07:<P>
Roxane- I have twice seen doctors about this complaint once at 13 and once at 19. The immediate advice I received was that a complete circumcision was required - after several agonising attempts were made to force the foreskin back.<BR>
Since then I have avoided raising the issue with them.<P>
I suppose that ideally I would like to have complete retraction of the foreskin. But I have grown used to the phimosis. I explain to the ladies in my life that this is something they must take into account and I have had no adverse reaction to it by them. For the rest it causes me no bother.<P>

>It sounds like you are happy with the way you are, but have you ever tried or considered trying the topical steroid cream? It has a 90+% success rate.<BR>
>Again, thank you for you reassurance.<BR>
>>> I have a complete phimosis and have had since birth. I don't believe that this stunted growth of my penis at all. It just means that I cannot pull back my foreskin which is also very long. It causes no pain or discomfort to me. However, I do agree that the glandes of uncircumcised men do generally remain smaller than those of circumcised ones. Most men, circumcised as adults  report an increase in the size of the glans.<BR>
>>Chances are that your boy will find the foreskin releasing itself soo

Hey its better with butter, or for tackiness castor oil added.<P>
It is my feeling that there isusually more than one area of the penis that is capable of producing an orgasm (helps perpetuate the species). <P>
One thing that can be effective is to start out with your hand over the end of the penis and work the lower side and edges with your fingers, the underside is also responsive to some deep clawing of the nerve structure there. Also with a thumb above and finger below a sliding motion will stimulated your newly increased corona. I find the corona entersin very strongly as a trigger. The un-circed rely heavily on the moving of the foreskin, even to the extent that without a condom they are sometimes merely masturbating in their foreskins even when having coitus. You may well find that as you accomodate to your current state sexual response may even be improved. It certainly is not doomed unless you think negatively and rob yourself thereby.
  <P> >Rob, the enlargement of your glans after circumcision suggests that your 
    very tight foreskin was not allowing the glans to reach its normal size, and 
    with the foreskin gone the glans has been able to reach the size it is supposed 
    to be. As to how to masturbate without a foreskin, lots of men (and boys) 
    have managed this for a long time. One way is to take a thin white pocket 
    handkerchief, place it around and over the glans so as to completely cover 
    it, then stroke the glans gently until it rises to the stimulus. The semen 
    that escapes at orgasm can be caught in the handkerchief, which can then be 
    washed and re-used when needed. Another way, which can be used in a shower, 
    is to make a lather with a very mild soap, rub it onto the bare glans, and 
    massage it until you reach orgasm. You can use sweet oil instead of soap if 
    you prefer, since there's no way it can burn the glans. The lady who wrote 
    "Sex and the single girl" suggested using Kool Whip (whipped cream substitute) 
    for oral sex. I don't know how it would work for masturbation. . .<BR>
    >I don't think you should worry about your enlarged glans unless it's giving 
    you trouble; it's probably just reached its normalsize for the first time 
    in your life. Lots of luck, RJK. <BR>
    >>I was circumcised 6 months ago because of a very tight foreskin at the age 
    of eighteen. I have noticed that my glans has enlarged almost to twice the 
    normal size it was before I was circumcised. What has caused this? Also I 
    am finding it very dificult to masturbate without a foreskin, as there is 
    no loose skin on my penis when I get an errection. How do you masturbate when 
    you are circumcised?

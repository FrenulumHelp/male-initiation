  <P> >Dean . thanks for the help ,I'm still not quite sure about the skin ..<BR>
    >which part is the frenulum ?<BR>
    >and does anyone know about the small veins that I have on my glans?<BR>
    Tony-<BR>
    Other than have you look at some drawings or pictures, I don't know how to 
    describe what the frenulum is for you. It is a fold of skin that attaches 
    underneath your glans(sometimes all the way to the opening of the slit) and 
    extends through the inverted V under the glans and connects to the foreskin. 
    When it is too short (as mine was) it will pull the head or glans downward 
    when it retracted while soft. You may want to look at some of the pictures 
    and drawings at http://www.foreskin.org. <BR>
    On the veins on your glans- I suspect they are not anything more than a normal 
    cluster of veins that happens to be close enough to be visible. someone else 
    may have a better clue.<BR>

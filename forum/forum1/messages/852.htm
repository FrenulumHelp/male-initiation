Hello,<P>
I'm wondering about wether I have got phimisos or another problem.<BR>
About a year ago my foreskin became a lot tighter, before it was no problem to get it back over the head when erect. But at that time it became more and more difficult to do that.  A couple of months before I spotted a lightish spot on the gland, about 2-3mm wide. The docter had a look and we had some tests done (a smear taken and sent to the hospital-lab), nothing to be found. The spot went more or less away, but as mentioned my foreskin became tighter. It became impossible to retract it when erect.<P>
At the moment it feels like the very 'front'-edge of the skin has gone hard and unstrechable, it looks quite white. The rest seems to be unaffected. I can retract the skin when cleaning, but only with some difficulty (not a lot of pain), the unstreched opening is about 10mm in diameter. I can 'pull' the gland from underneath while stretching the skin back to clean. Pulling it back is not too difficult.<P>
My question: what could this be, phimosis or a skin infection, or other and secondly of course what to do about it?<P>
Thanks for any reply's<BR>
Gerard

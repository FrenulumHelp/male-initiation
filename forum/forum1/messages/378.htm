As an answer to: <A HREF="376.htm">Frenulum/Smegma</A> written by John at 26 Apr 2000 10:33:08:
  <P> John, it doesn't sound normal that after years of being easily kept clean 
    your penis has suddenly begun producing smegma in such quantities that it 
    requires cleaning four times a day. One wonders if youy don't have an infection 
    that is causing the production of pus in some quantity. To sum up, this doesn't 
    sound like a "normal" penis problem, and it does sound as if you should go 
    to a physician as soon as possible to get his/her input. Don't panic; if he/she 
    tells you you have to get circumcised, go get a second (or third) opinion 
    from another doctor. Without much question if there is a problem of adhesions, 
    etc. it probably can be ended without resorting to circumcision. Regrettably 
    the medical profession is sometimes a bit remiss on penile problems (and occasionally 
    woefully ignorant, it would seem), but if there is a sudden change that may 
    involve infection, your best bet is still probably to consult a doctor. Best 
    wishes, RJK.<BR>
    >I am 32 years old, and am uncircumsized. I have never had a problem with 
    my penis....<B>ever</B>....until now. <BR>
    >I have concluded that part of my problem is called "smegma"....a lubricant 
    that the foreskin produces. In 32 years, I have never produced this smegma, 
    or at least it was such a miniscule amount that I have never noticed it. I 
    have always been confused about the discussions of keeping an uncircumsised 
    penis clean, because I have never had to worry about it....it has always been 
    clean, which I thought was due to being sanitary and taking a shower every 
    day. Well, in the last 2 weeks or so, I have had to clean myself 3 or 4 times 
    a day.<BR>
    >This is my first concern.....why is it surfacing now, and is there something 
    I can do to get my old self back?<BR>
    >My second concern is that my frenulum looks like it is half cut, and is a 
    bit discomforting when retracting my foreskin, or pulling it back over my 
    penis. It is even temporarily uncomfortable when urinating. It hasn't ever 
    bled uncontrolably.....but it has produced a blood drop or 2 from me prodding 
    at it.<BR>
    >Is this tear caused from an infection from smegma? <BR>
    >Just as a little "personal" information (maybe TOO personal, but what the 
    hay!) about me......I have always masturbated since around the age of 13 and 
    have been sexually active for more than 10 years......so I can rule out the 
    theory of "first-time erection" and "awakening my sexualality" being the cause 
    of my smegma and frenulum problem.<BR>
    >Is there anyone who can shed some insight, or even theories for my condition?

Written by michael at 22 Jul 2000 08:32:27:<P>
I've pretty much read all the previous conversations and am trying to put it<BR>
all together. Here we have the human penis that comes with this sort of pro-<BR>
tective glove which for most fellows is retractable past the glans (head) of<BR>
the penis, if it hasn't already been cut back for any along a wide gamut of <BR>
cultural reasons. Those who retain this retractable skin I would guess have <BR>
long since learned to dutifully carry out some form of regular cleaning <BR>
operation. But those of us (a wee tiny minority) without this blessing of <BR>
retractability may possibly never entertained any notion of cleaning the <BR>
phallus anywhere but on the outside. It's like one of the writers somewhere <BR>
(maybe a differnt web site)wrote that he kind of likened what was visible <BR>
(the reddish tip) within the hollow of a small foreskin opening, to one's <BR>
eyeball. You don't go about washing the eyeball, and little more does one <BR>
address the eyelids - the whole area being so delicate. The inside tip of<BR>
my penis seemed like something to be left alone - it didn't seem constructed <BR>
to tamper with. I assummed that with normal exterior washing the rest would <BR>
somehow naturally take care of itself (think of how the ear canal, eyes, and <BR>
nose are to a large extent self cleaning);indeed I have never had infections<BR>
in 42 years (chlorinated pool H20 helped during years of swimming helped?)<BR>
I have fathered 3 boys (all circumcised I must say) so the procreative pur-<BR>
pose of the old oak tree has not been in question, though there has always <BR>
been minor discomfort in the initial stage of sex - trying to actually make<BR>
it inside the vagina cause if the tightness at the penis tip. But once my <BR>
wife's own tightness gives way and lubrication begins then we are good to go<BR>
(heh,heh) I often reflect on the similarities to my most early sexual unions<BR>
because of this element of preventative-like restriction. It's one of the <BR>
things that keeps me young of mind in a strange way. But now I am kind of <BR>
at a stage where I want to experience what added joys and pleasure may be <BR>
experienced with a fully exposed glans - that's right folks I am looking <BR>
forward to going for it !! This brings me finally (almost)to my questions. <BR>
I have experimented somewhat, and can manage to pull the foreskin back only <BR>
far enough to expose a structure about half the tip of your little finger - <BR>
that's it - without any pain. At that point there seems to be my first clue <BR>
about this frenulum that is supposed to attach the foreskin to some portion<BR>
of the glans (to the sulcus?). There seems to be a little ridge of skin <BR>
involved right there at the tip and I get the distinct impression that this<BR>
frenulum affair is quickly going to prevent my being able to pull back the <BR>
foreskin much farther at all. It just really seems to tug up around there <BR>
giving a pain to about the same degree as that from pressing a pretty sharp<BR>
fingernail into the palm of your hand with a few pounds of force. It is this<BR>
pain I feel in the first stage of sex. Pulling it tight like that makes <BR>
evident what possibly is this infamous phimotic ring. It basically appears a <BR>
little more "reinforced" right at the actual foreskin fold. It is about there<BR>
too, under the extra pressure exerted in my little retraction attempt, that I<BR>
see quite a lot of vein work. So my questions arenow these:  <P>
1) Can these various cortisone creams, while somehow thinning out the foreskin,<BR>
   have a bad effect on the appreciable vascular network so closely involved ?<BR>
2) Can these creams have any loosening or stretching effect on the frenulum ?<BR>
3) If a dorsal slit is perfomed to create a relief mechanism to help facilitate<BR>
   retraction, how is it possible to avoid compromising the frenulum (which I<BR>
   understand is so chocked full of pleasure nerves, and should be respected at<BR>
   all costs (For after all, we here in the states may feel entitled to the<BR>
   pursuit of happiness, you know).<BR>
4) Is the slit often made in the dorsal area since the resulting loose tissue<BR>
   flaps (ostensibly undesirable in appearance) would be less apparent when the<BR>
   penis hangs in its flaccid state ?<BR>
5) Is it within the realm of common sense that the relief cut is normally <BR>
   made in a dorsal location so that if the frenulum is involved it can be<BR>
   snipped a bit there so that now all little flaps are simply in a single <BR>
   area.<BR>
6) What is that frenuplasty (I know my spelling is way off here but I can't go<BR>
   back to check the right way at his point) procedure?  I mean is there some<BR>
   real room for minimalism here (where you can barely notice operative cuts<BR>
   etc.). Or some creativity in the snipping and stitching that may be involved?<BR>
7) Given the fact that the glans itself is covered with some kind of mucosal-<BR>
   like tissue, how do you get this helmet-like protuberance willing to exist<BR>
   in the cruel abrasive environment - open hair, rough clothes, etc. - for the<BR>
   first time in over 40 years ?<BR>
8) (6) and (7) having been asked, is there any possibility in this fantastic<BR>
   technologically miraculous age of ours to install a very thin micro-zipper<BR>
   so that one could unzip ones foreskin zipper either for sex or for washing<BR>
   than zip back up? Thus any flaps that may have been a bit unsightly can<BR>
   be justed zipped shut. Sorta keep the skin fully intact (have cake and eat<BR>
   it too, if you will)<BR>
9) Have any the visitors reading the dialogue in this section, had any<BR>
   experience, using cream and pull-back exercises, where some ripping or<BR>
   tearing of the skin occurred?  Did you wait for more than a day to heal<BR>
   up before you tried again? (Or how long?) What about any scar tissue that<BR>
   could then develop? At what point does elasticity begin to be so compromised<BR>
   that diminishing returns ensue?<BR>
10) Is there any safe tool that a man can use to stretch the foreskin<BR>
    opening uniformly (around the the circumference) and gradually (over<BR>
    hours, days, weeks)? I thought I saw some such apparatus in my surfing.<BR>
    It definitely could make a lot of sense. Certainly there are various <BR>
    peoples about the world who practice various kind of skin stretching or<BR>
    hole expanding using some appliance over some appreciable length of time.<P>
(!!) Hey thanks for everyone's time. Please answer what questions you can.<BR>
     I believe they are all pretty good ones - relevant and haven't really<BR>
     been raised before.  I have visited and tried to deal with a few Urology <BR>
     groups here in the U.S. midwest and I am not really getting very straight<BR>
     answers. I hope to arm myself with enough good ideas so that I can<BR>
     deal with any of medical community proactively and effectively but<BR>
     tactfully as well.  I had conjured up a few notions of documenting my<BR>
     efforts, in a way that could foster enlightenment. I did call the local<BR>
     paper at one point but they are not quite ready to bite. So please supply<BR>
     your best ideas, piecemeal or comprehensively in your responses which I<BR>
     very greatly appreciate, and look forward to applying towards the pleasures<BR>
     of lovemaking and providing a decent follow-up here in good time(Thanks).

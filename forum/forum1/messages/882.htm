  <P> >I have had bumps on my penis for a couple of months now and i need help. 
    I would like to know how to solve this problem. They are little white bumps, 
    some are like pimples but some are not. They dont itch that much and dont 
    seem to bother me other than the ugly appearance. Im about to get a girl friend. 
    HELP ME. I just want to know what it is or how to solve it. The bumps are 
    on the shaft of my penis.

As an answer to: <A HREF="502.htm">Re: Frenulum/Smegma</A> written by Baruka Rohani at 17 Jul 2000 18:53:34:
  <P> Baruka, it sounds very much as if you have an infection (particularly since 
    you say your frenulum is half-torn) and the matter you are finding is probably 
    not smegma; it may be pus. If you have ready access to a physician, it would 
    be a very good idea to go to one straightaway, not allowing yourself to put 
    it off because of embarrassment or any other reservation. The condition probably 
    can be treated and cured in a reasonably short time, whereas leaving it unattended 
    may cause serious problems. For your own good, find a doctor soon! Good luck!

    >>>I am 32 years old, and am uncircumsized. I have never had a problem with 
    my penis....<B>ever</B>....until now. <BR>
    >>>I have concluded that part of my problem is called "smegma"....a lubricant 
    that the foreskin produces. In 32 years, I have never produced this smegma, 
    or at least it was such a miniscule amount that I have never noticed it. I 
    have always been confused about the discussions of keeping an uncircumsised 
    penis clean, because I have never had to worry about it....it has always been 
    clean, which I thought was due to being sanitary and taking a shower every 
    day. Well, in the last 2 weeks or so, I have had to clean myself 3 or 4 times 
    a day.<BR>
    >>>This is my first concern.....why is it surfacing now, and is there something 
    I can do to get my old self back?<BR>
    >>>My second concern is that my frenulum looks like it is half cut, and is 
    a bit discomforting when retracting my foreskin, or pulling it back over my 
    penis. It is even temporarily uncomfortable when urinating. It hasn't ever 
    bled uncontrolably.....but it has produced a blood drop or 2 from me prodding 
    at it.<BR>
    >>>Is this tear caused from an infection from smegma? <BR>
    >>>Just as a little "personal" information (maybe TOO personal, but what the 
    hay!) about me......I have always masturbated since around the age of 13 and 
    have been sexually active for more than 10 years......so I can rule out the 
    theory of "first-time erection" and "awakening my sexualality" being the cause 
    of my smegma and frenulum problem.<BR>
    >>>Is there anyone who can shed some insight, or even theories for my condition?

After deciphering your question, ... its not really my speciality ... the important difference from my perspective is between when the frenulum is too short and a normal functioning "quick action" foreskin. <P>
Even if veins and nerves run through some frenulums, some men are born without any frenulum so any difference is minimal, ... I feel as though as long as everything functions without pain then as several famous people have said: the most important sexual organ is the brain - .... and here we aparrently use only round 1% of the potential ...  <P>
The main point is that sex without a frenulum is far better than sex with a short frenulum <P>

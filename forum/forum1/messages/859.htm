As an answer to: <A HREF="562.htm">Is it possible to have sex with your forskin forwards</A> written by Paul Fowler at 07 Aug 2000 23:00:36:<P>
>I am 20 years old and I've always had a tight forskin. As long as I can remember, I have had a problem. I cannot get my forskin over the head of my penis and recently my girlfriend has been suggesting that we have sex, but I keep putting her off because I don't know if you can have sex with your forskin forwards.<BR>
>Is it possible?! I don't want to put it off anymore cause she'll soon get the wrong idea and I'm too embrassed to talk about it with my girlfriend.<BR>
>Help!!! Is is possible for me to have sex with my forskin forwards?

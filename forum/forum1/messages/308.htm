Ed,<P>
I've known for a long time that my penis was unusual, but the emnarassment of seeing a doctor about it has preveneted me from doing anything about it. However, ever since I stumbled onto this site, I have been able to investigate my problem with more confidence and, armed with a little bit of knowledge, recently I plucked up the courage to visit my doctor who referred me to a urologist. <P>
The outcome was an operation involving 2 incisions to the foreskin which now allow me to fully retract my foreskin over the glans when flaccid, which I could not do previously. However, my experiences when I am erect or semi-erect are very similar to yours ie. pain on erection; possible when semi-erect but painful on full erection. The inner foreskin balloons around the ridge when my foreskin is fully retracted on erection and it takes a few days for the soreness and swelling to be relieved.<P>
I am seeing my specialist again in a couple of weeks and he will hopefully be able to provide some rememdy for the the situation. One thing I hope to discuss with him is the suitability (or otherwise) of topical steriod creams.<P>
Have you had any success using such creams? Are you still experiencing pain on retraction on full erection? Is there any advice that others out there have that may be useful?<P>
Thanks,<P>

&gt;&gt;Hello all,
&gt;&gt;  What a relief to have found your site!   I would appreciate very much any help you could all give me, or perhaps refer me to another source of advice for my problem.  Thank you in advance for spending the time considering my problem.
&gt;&gt;I am a 32 year old male.  I have a 6&quot; penis. Since a child I have had an incredibly tight foreskin.
&gt;&gt;When my penis is flaccid my foreskin covers my penis completely and comfortably.
&gt;&gt;In the flaccid state I can withdraw the foreskin completely to reveal the head with no problems, and often do for hygiene purposes etc.
&gt;&gt;When my penis is fully erect I can only reveal about 10% of the head before the foreskin tightens too much.  If I try to force the foreskin back in an errect state my penis/head becomes almost unbearably painful, and sex in this condition is agony.
&gt;&gt;With my penis semi hard I am able to withdraw the foreskin back to the base of the head, if I then progress to full erection with the foreskin behind my head, the foreskin constricts to an extent that my head becomes deep purple as the blood flow is being constricted. I can have some sex like this but unless I have abstained form sex for weeks, I can only tolerate a few minuets of sex before the pain overrides any pleasure. Whenever I have done this the foreskin gets slightly stuck behind my head, but not in an unconfortable way, and will take a few days before returning to normal.
&gt;&gt;After all these years my head has become incredibly sensitive due to the lack of exposure and the whole thing is affecting my sex life adversely, as I am very unconfident about being able to have pleasurable sex, which in turn has limited the opportunities and pleasure I can experience.
&gt;&gt;I have been to my local GP (doctor) for advice who very quickly told me that circumcision was the only answer.  I do not think this is right as everything I have read about circumcision seems very negative and it does seem such an extreme solution.
&gt;&gt;Finally I began trawling the web and found you guys and the Tripod & Cirp sites.
&gt;&gt;I read about Michel Beauge and began to hope there was a solution other than surgery.
&gt;&gt;Having absorbed about as much as I can from the web I would like to try stretching as a remedy, but despite all the articles on it I am still a little uncertain how to go about stretching my foreskin.
&gt;&gt;Should I do it when flaccid, or erect?
&gt;&gt;How long should before I see some results?
&gt;&gt;Should I use Astro Glide, and if so how easy is it to obtain in the UK? (Over the counter at a chemsit?)
&gt;&gt;What technique is best?
&gt;&gt;When masterbating I always keep my foreskin over my head, and have never had any problems ejaculating.  Mr Beauge mentions adopting a different technique when masterbating.  Does anyone know what this technique is?
&gt;&gt;I have just read Roxane mention Topical Sterod Cream.  
&gt;&gt;Can this help in an adult? How would one obtain it in the UK?
&gt;&gt;Sorry for all the questions, I am just desperate to find a solution I can live with.
&gt;&gt;Many thanks-  Ed Recio.

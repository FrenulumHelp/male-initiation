My two year old uncircumcised son has an appointment next week with a pediatric urologist regarding what I believe is phimosis.  I am researching this so that I am well armed for the visit.  I will not concent to circumcision and would like to know what other alternatives exist.  The opening at the tip of the foreskin (the ring) is too tight for any retraction.  When he urinates the remaining foreskin enlarges like a balloon.  It appears that the urine cannot exit quickly enough through the opening.  I believe that the remaining foreskin would retract if the ring were larger.  Any help or information would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you!!

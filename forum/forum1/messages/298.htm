Hi Sarah<BR>
A lot of what you describe reminds me of frenulum breve .... getting the condom is usually a problem ...  once its on then the foreskin is held in place .... excess pain during penetration is relevant with some degrees<P>
check out the links to frenulum on<BR>
<A HREF="../../../welcome.html#start">www.male-initiation.net</A><BR>
 .... .... stretching frenulum in the shower doesnt work (well it may be an interesting experiment) it requires a simple incision not circumcision<P>
hope that helps<BR>

&gt;&gt;Text:    My lover was 18 and a virgin when we started having sex.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;The first time we had sex we used a condom and sex painful for him, and he found achieving orgasm difficult.
&gt;&gt;Since his penis is quite large, we assumed the condom was too tight, and purchased some larger ones. 
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;This helped alieviate the problem, but did not completely remove it.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Recently, after I recieved my all clear on STD testing, we started having sex without condoms, expecting that all pain and difficulty with achieving orgasm would cease.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Unfortuneately, this was not the case.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;He experiences pain on entry, strong enough to make him wince and hiss, but not
&gt;&gt;enough to make him want to stop. Once he has entered fully, there is not more pain, but orgasm is often delayed and sometimes simply does not happen. This is
&gt;&gt;frustrating and distressing for us both.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I remarked casually that I felt perhaps his foreskin was too tight (although he has never had any discomfort when masturbating), and he said he tended to agree. 
&gt;&gt;I mentioned that gentle stretching in the shower could sometimes help with the
&gt;&gt;problem, and he said he would try.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I am still concerned, however, as he has mentioned that his mother once told him
&gt;&gt;that he had some penile problem as an infant (but did not specify what the problem had been).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I have also noticed that the seam or raphe that runs the length of his shaft is broken and distorted from the top of the scrotum to about 2 or 3 inches up his shaft.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I am curious as to the nature of his problem, for until we know what precicely it is, we cannot really find a solution.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Hoping someone will have some ideas that can help us.

Firstly I would like to thank Robin for such a well presented and imformative site, keep up the good work, Its much appreciated.<P>
It would appear that I fall into the category of a recently presented relative phimosis. As such it would appear that my only options are surgical; my doctor would only reccomended a full circumcision.<P>
There doesnt seem to be much in the way of suggested causes for this type of phimosis, If, as I suspect I will, I opt for a partial circ, it would be nice to do all i can to prevent this from happening again.......<P>
I would also like to ask, If i do end up with a full circ, is masturbation without the topbit the same as with, surely it must rub...?<P>
Regards<BR>
GM<P>
Robin : If I get a little more spare time I might contact you about helping out with the admin...

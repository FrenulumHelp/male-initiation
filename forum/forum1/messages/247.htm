I see some are wondering how I cured my phimosis. Ok, here goes. When I first saw there was a problem, I tried stretching it in the shower, I tried soaking it in warm water then stretching it, I tried hand lotion and stretching it etc. None of it worked *for me*. Then I went to the doctor and got the betamethasone 05%. I would apply it to my foreskin. It would soak in, and most days I would mastrabate (like any regular day. LOL) That would stretch it along with sex. But I never made any real serious attempts to purposely stretch my foreskin for the sake of stretching it. <P>
At the end of 7 or 8 weeks, it was all cleared up.

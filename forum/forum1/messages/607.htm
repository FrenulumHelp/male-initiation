As an answer to: <A HREF="505.htm">paraphimosis</A> written by joe at 19 Jul 2000 20:34:03:<P>
>hi. I think I have paraphimosis my foreskin is behind the gland of my penis all the time. It will stretch over the gland but it retracts behind the gland if let go. I am wondering if this is normal, do many people have this condition or is it something not to be worried about? please write!<P>
MR RESPONSE:  It may not be paraphimosis, which is a condition requiring medical or other treatment due to the foreskin being so tight that it chokes the penis and causes pain or swelling.  A foreskin that is merely snug and comfortable in its retracted position, or short enough to want to, is ideal and in no need of treatment.  Mine and others I know have been fully retracted permanently since about puberty, and we wouldn't want it any other way.  Lucky you.

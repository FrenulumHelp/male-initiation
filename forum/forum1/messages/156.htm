Hi, it's me Andrew again!<P>
Thankyou very much to all of you who took the time to send me some advice. I have tried streching my foreskin gently when in the bath and the effects have been great! I have had no problems with cuts or discomfort since! I was somewhat surprised that it worked so well. It's a big relief because it was really starting to worry me and I was almost resigned to the fact that I would have to see a doctor.<P>
So cheers everyone! Its a good job there are sites like this where people can talk openly about such things.<P>

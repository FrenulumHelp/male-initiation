  <P> >>>>Since a lot of years I try to keep my foreskin back.<BR>
    >Why??? The foreskin is there to protect your glans from the harmful rays 
    of the sun. Why would you ever want to keep it pulled back? Are you ashamed 
    of your penis?<BR>
    How Gerard keeps his penis is his business, not yours or mine. It is not up 
    to you or me, or anyone else, to require him to explain why he does what he 
    does to his penis, or any other part of his anatomy.<BR>
    >The uncircumcised penis is a beautiful thing, leave it that way.<BR>
    That is your opinion, to which you are entitled, but it is not shared universally.<BR>
    >Why do you think you lost sensitivity in the glans? The foreskin protects 
    it from harmful effects and from rubbing against clothing and the like. Circumcised 
    men have a lot less feeling in their penis than uncircumcised men, and experience 
    a lot less pleasure.<BR>
    How do you know this? Have you been circumcised yourself? Some circumcised 
    men claim otherwise; they certainly report experiencing considerable pleasure 
    (a thing difficult to quantify in any case).<BR>
    >You are lucky enough to have your foreskin - cherish it and enjoy it and 
    be proud, don't hide it and try to look "American".<BR>
    Not all American men are circumcised, only around 90 million. Most of them 
    have no problem with the way they look. At that, they still represent a minority 
    of the world's circumcised men. How Gerard looks is his affair, not yours 
    or mine.<BR>

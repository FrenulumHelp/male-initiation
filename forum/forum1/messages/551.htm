Hi.<P>
I am 19 and have never seen my foreskin retracted. I have a very tight foreskin wich cannot be retracted at all even when not erect.  This however has not stopped me having sex, infact Because I am less sensitive I can outlast most of the girls I'm Fucking. because of this and other reasons I do not not wish for my foreskin to be made 'normal'. My only fear is that my tight foreskin will through sex eventually stretch to a point where it can be only partially retracted, thus risking pain. I have read about men who have learned to live and do infact prefer their non-retractable foreskins.  I would like too talk with these men, as I live in a country which can only be described as living ion the medical dark ages.  Thanks for any help.<P>

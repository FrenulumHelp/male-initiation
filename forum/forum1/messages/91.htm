>>From the age of about 11-16 I noticed that I had a tight foreskin, but i didnt notice any adhesions.  During one of my early sexual experiences I ripped some of the elastic tissue thats attached to the foreskin.<BR>

>>I am now 23 and since then the tightness has gone, but as a result I have reduced sexual pleasure.<BR>

>>Do you have any advice?<BR>

>yes- feel fortunate that nature took care of a problem with your frenulum!! many would be pleased to have the foreskin loose enough to do what it is supposed to-- help with insertion and glide back and forth during sex (solo or otherwise!!) <P>

wonderful answer dd,<BR>
pop in again<P>
It occurs to me that frenulum breve is sometimes identified as cause for premature ejaculation, as this is only occasionally reported then I suspect it must happen in specific anatomical cases, depending on the internal nerve structures, ...<P>
This nervous stimulation which was controllable and enjoyable during masturbation, would easily become uncontrollable during intercourse and lead to the problems of premature ejaculation.<P>

As an answer to: <A HREF="184.htm">Re: wish for circumcision</A> written by KK at 03 Jan 2000 02:11:49:
  <P> >>>From an early teen years I've prefered the look (and feel) of the circumcised 
    penis despite a realisation of the irrationality of it. which way should I 
    go?<BR>
    >>My advise would be to get it done. I was circumcised at 27 and have never 
    looked back. I just wish I'd had it done earlier. So go ahead, it's worth 
    it! <BR>
    >I got circumcised. I like the look of it, the feel of it and find it much 
    more attractive without the skin hood. If you want to know more about how 
    it went - write me. It was nothing. I can't t hink why guys get worried about 
    it. Circumcision is also very erotic<BR>
    Agree on erotic aspect as well. would like to know more - specifically on 
    requesting style </BLOCKQUOTE>

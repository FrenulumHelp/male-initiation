No problem about that Im not a father yet but theres nothing wrong with my erection even if I have pinhole phimosis ,maybe sexual activity will hurt a little bit and thats why you should consider a partial circumcision.<BR>
  <P> >If you have phimosis is it still possible to father a child? I know this 
    is an incredibly naive question but it's been playing on my mind for a long 
    time. I would love to have children one day...

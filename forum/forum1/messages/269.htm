  <P> Hi Rob,<BR>
    Yes, the opening just gradually shrunk again and he'll probably have to use 
    the cream again once he hits puberty.<BR>
    An adult male, who is sexually active or even just masturbating (excuse my 
    bluntness) wouldn't have this concern.<BR>
    I think the Kelanog .1% works faster because it's stronger, but you would 
    probably have an easier time getting your doctor to prescribe betamethasone 
    .05%<BR>
    since this is what all the studies you'll find on the web recommend.<BR>
    If you have trouble finding a doctor to prescibe it, there is a group called 
    Doctor's Opposing Circumcission: gcd at u.washington.edu <BR>
    They gave us the name of the doctor who helped us and they may be able to 
    hook you up with someone.<BR>
    Hope this helps you out. Please let me know how things go.<BR>

    >Thanks for responding .. I'm new to the cream thing .. Does this mean that 
    an adult male as well, would need to regularly retract his foreskin even after 
    getting successful results with the cream ?<BR>
    >I was wondering .. your son's condition .. the opening just gradually shrunk 
    again ?<BR>
    >Right now I need to find a new urologist to help prescribe the cream.<BR>
    >Should I be asking for Kenalog or betamethasone ?<BR>
    >>We were prescribed Kenalog cream for our son a couple of years ago. It is 
    similar to the betamethasone so I imagine the price would be comparable.<BR>
    >>I don't remember the exact cost, but I do remember that it was quite reasonable.<BR>
    >>In my son's case the results haven't lasted, but that is because he was 
    only about 7 when we used the cream and we could not get him to continue to 
    retract his foreskin regularly to keep it loose.</BLOCKQUOTE>

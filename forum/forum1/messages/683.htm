Well this may be a men's page, but no matter...<BR>
My boyfriend has phimosis and we can't have sex regularly, this is frustrating to me but he is afraid of surgery and won't even go and see a doctor... We've talked about it many times, but i can't force him...<BR>
What should I do ?<BR>
(I hope you understood, I'm French...)<BR>

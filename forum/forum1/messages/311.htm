Hi Jimmy and Ed,<P>
glad you both found my site useful and found your way here to the communication center, <P>
Dear Ed,<BR>
I saw a couple of your entries but only just got round to reading your original letter, it sounds like you were practicing sex with a controlled form of paraphimosis, :-! ... I think I answered you on one stretching question, have the creams worked? ... have you yet considered minimal , non removing surgery, like dorsal slits ... even two like our pal Jimmy ....<P>
>The outcome was an operation involving 2 incisions to the foreskin <P>
ok, 2 slits ... one could presume at 45 degree and 315 degree so NE and NW as the compass flies ... would create a ridge which will probably balance itself out and pull itself to fit in a few months ... <P>
the coronal ridge might well grow,? or be a bit sore for a while after an op. ... or so soon after an op, is the scar rubbing ? where is the pain coming from?<BR>
  <BR>
>which now allow me to fully retract my foreskin over the glans when flaccid, which I could not do previously. However, my experiences when I am erect or semi-erect are very similar to yours ie. pain on erection; possible when semi-erect but painful on full erection. The inner foreskin balloons around the ridge when my foreskin is fully retracted on erection and it takes a few days for the soreness and swelling to be relieved.<P>
dont know much about creams - tell us what the urologist says.
  <P> Cheers Robin

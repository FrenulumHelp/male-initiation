Sounds like you've got a condition called hypospadias. A lot of guys have it, and whether it matters or not depends on how bad it is. I've known guys with it mildly, just with their pee-hole at the bottom of their knob, and it doesnt worry them, but I know it can be worse, and in that case it needs medical attention. Can you describe?  I know it can often be corrected surgically, but I think it's easiest for uncircumcised guys.

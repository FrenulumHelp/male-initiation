They told me I had to get circd but I used a creme called "betamethasone .05%" instead. Go to your doctor and get a prescription for it. Apply it once per day to the outside tip of your foreskin. If he says it wont work, print this out and show it to him (take it with you when you go to see him) http://www.cirp.org/library/treatment/phimosis/<BR>
>It took about 6-8 weeks for my foreskin to go all the way back. But mine was REALLY tight. I couldnt even pull it back past the pee slit while flaccid.  <BR>
>To dull the sensitivity get some Ambesol or any kind of tooth ache stuff. Apply a little to your glans (head) and then pour a little cold water on it. Then take a Q-tip or something and rub it against your glans for about 5-10 min. Do this 2 times or so and make sure you touch your head everyday for a week or so to get it less sensitive. THIS WILL WORK!!!! Trust me.  I know because I did it last year.<BR>
>Good luck,<BR>

  <P> MY RESPONSE:<BR>
    Another widely known tooth ache relief gel is Ora-Gel. There is also a lubricant 
    popular for sex called KY or something which contains novocaine or other ingredient 
    which will temporarily dull the feeling. You could also try wearing a rubber 
    (prophylactic) over the penis. The hypersensitivity should only last a matter 
    of of weeks at the most and then become comfortable and pleasant.

You are lucky that you managed to save the boy!  But actually, most, if not all Brazilians are uncircumcised. My husband and I lived there for four years, and our son and daughter were both born there.  While my husband is circumcised, we decided not to circumcise our son, and are both very happy about that decision. In our playgroups with him, we noticed not one of the other Brazilian boys were circumcised, and when I mentioned to some of the mothers that we had considered it, they were shocked and surprised, even just on aesthetic grounds - -it looks so much cuter and sexier, they said.<BR>
Our son is now 8, and his foreskin has not retracted yet, but our pediatrician says that is not unusual.<BR>

    >In the US circumcision is frequently the knee jerk answer to any "problem", 
    but it is surprising that would happen in a So. American country. Are many 
    Brazilians circumcised?<BR>
    >>My husbands 8 year old boy, who does not live with us, was almost circumcised 
    this week in his native country of Brazil. His grandparents wanted him 'done' 
    because they had noted his foreskin looked tight so they took him to a (private) 
    doctor who said he needed to be circumcised (at a great cost, I might add). 
    We live in Britain and were horrified to find the message from his mother 
    who is working in another country saying for us to ring him in Brazil as he 
    was "going to be circumcised this morning"...so we rang and him and the grandparents 
    were just about to go to the hospital with the little boy. My husband enquired 
    why he was going to be circumcised and the grandfather said because he'd noticed 
    that the boy's foreskin looked tight. We asked if he was in pain, or had an 
    infection or difficulty in urinating and the answer was "no" and the grandfather 
    said not to be silly as he'd had it done and in Brazil it is not even considered 
    an operation etc etc. My husband and him had a blazing row over the phone 
    as we felt he should have been consulted. My husband spoke to the boy who 
    it turns out did not even have an idea what was just about to happen to him...he 
    just thought he was going to the doctor's and was absolutely horrified when 
    his father explained what was going to happen but he also stressed it was 
    HIS choice and his body and in the absence of any problems he should object 
    strongly if he did not want to be circumcised. It was a very difficult situation 
    over the phone so far appart but in the end my husband had to say that he 
    did not give his authorisation for his son to be operated on and that he would 
    not give his permission for him to visit them back in Rio again if it went 
    ahead. We explained that there were alternatives to circumcision (I am a midwife 
    and nurse so I am not unfamiliar with health matters) etc. The boy is now 
    in Britain staying with us for two weeks. I have seen his penis in the bath 
    and spected his foreskin to be completely fused to the glans because the grandparents 
    seemed to think it was so damn urgent. He can completely retract his foreskin 
    but there seems to be a little bit of a thin, ring about a cm down from the 
    glans on his penis which makes it look very slightly constricted. There is 
    no pain whatsoever on retraction and there is no tightness on the frenulum. 
    He has never suffered from balanitis either. My own 13 year old son incidentally 
    had balanitis a couple of times as a young child but with some hydrocortisone 
    cream the problem cleared up and he is fine now. I also seem to remember that 
    his penis was similarly, slightly constricted when his foreskin was pulled 
    back but as I said he is now fine. Obviously I need to know urgently if this 
    is a problem, although my inmediate reaction and his dad's was one of relief 
    when we realised he could put the foreskin back so easily and painlessly but 
    we have his mother now arguing that if he has not problem why did this surgeon 
    want to operate in Brazil so hastily?. My husband and I are convinced that 
    it is all because of the money he would be paid. Strangely enough the boy 
    also showed us 3 perfectly healthy teeth that the dentist had pulled out over 
    there because they were slightly wobbly and he could not "otherwise put fluoride 
    in the rest of the teeth"...for that the grandparents were charged an exhorbitant 
    ammount of money too...it all seems to me quite barbaric, unnecessary and 
    incredible. The boy was even given the teeth inside an tooth shaped holder 
    to hang around his neck! (FOR REAL!!) and said that he did not get an anaesthetic 
    and it hurt like hell!. I have read all about the Betamethasone cream etc 
    but I don't even know if he really needs that!. His dad just thinks he looks 
    like a normal boy and that his penis should be just left alone. I think the 
    boy feels now that there is something 'wrong' with him and he says he was 
    most upset and embarrassed about the doctor in Brazil handling his penis. 
    The other side of the family wants us to take him to a paediatrician here 
    but I am loath to do that and increase the feeling for him that there is really 
    something wrong. <BR>
    >>Sorry to ramble on but this has been so upsetting for us.<BR>
    >>thank you<BR>

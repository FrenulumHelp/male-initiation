Thanks for all the help  <BR>
I will try different methods and hope my penis head will get less sensitive soon. <P>

  <P> > Excessive sensitivity of the penis head -after- it is exposed requires 
    a different treatment. I have read others who suggest oil of cloves or juice 
    from the eucaliptus bush, but I cannot comment from experience. A common jelly 
    used to aid in sex is called KY and may contain something of novocaine that 
    temporarily numbs the feeling. You may have to wrap the penis head with soft 
    tissue or cloth for a few days or week or two until you get more used to it. 
    It is only temporary and will begin to feel good in a short time.

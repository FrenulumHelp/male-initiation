As an answer to: <A HREF="525.htm">Re: Long Foreskin</A> written by Jerry at 26 Jul 2000 18:37:47:
  <P> Jerry makes a good point which I unfortunately forgot to cover when I wrote 
    you earlier. The idea of taking a tuck in the external foreskin at the base 
    of the penis, then reattaching it at that point, would seem to be the most 
    sensible method of treating your condition if the other more conservative 
    suggestions fail to work. I understand it is sometimes done in Japan when 
    they don't want to remove the tip of the foreskin. In your case enough could 
    be removed to bring the foreskin's tip back even with the tip of the glans, 
    or more could be removed to expose some or all of the glans. A cosmetic advantage 
    of this procedure is, once the pubic hairs have grown back, no surgical scar 
    is visible. Of course, you need to find a surgeon who is familiar with this 
    procedure (posibly a plastic surgeon) for it to work out to your advantage. 
    Good luck! Bob. <BR>
    >I agree that you may be able to fold the foreskin under, by grasping it with 
    both hands, exposing most of the glans, as long as the frenulum is not in 
    the way. There is also another type of "circumcision" where they essentially 
    take a tuck in the skin at the base of the penis, thus drawing back the foreskin 
    to whatever degree you wish withour compromising the intergrity of the foreskin.<BR>
    >Good luck!<BR>

    > a young guy with a very long foreskin, I have a inch and a half overhang 
    when soft and half a inch overhang when hard. Though my foreskin slides back 
    very easy, I find when having sex after a few thrusts it slips forward over 
    the glans and I don't get much stimulation and it is very hard to cum. I also 
    find wearing a condom impossible as it slides forward with the foreskin and 
    quiet often breaks. Do any other guys have this problem and is there any way 
    of shorting my foreskin. I don't want to get circumcised.

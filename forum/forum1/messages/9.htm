my 18 month old son had a little blood at the end of his penis and then ballooned up when he tried to urinate...it drained a few minutes later.  I took him to my pediatrician who has made us an appointment with an urologist.  I was told circumsision was the treatment.  I am looking for any and all information I can get.  I am hoping there is alternatives.  I want to do the best for my child but would like to keep him intact if at all possible. I would appreciate any information.  Thank you.

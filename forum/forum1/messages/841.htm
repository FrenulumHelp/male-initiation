I feel here again we see the initiate hesitating with a fear of the unknown, his foreskin complex like every good problem <I>comfortably</I> repressed (probably resulting from years of fear about cirucumcision), has not read <A HREF="../../../welcome.html#start"> my site</A> and has not yet heard of new miracle creams to end his torment.Written by Paul Fowler at 07 Aug 2000 23:00:36:<P>
I am 20 years old and I've always had a tight forskin. As long as I can remember, I have had a problem. I cannot get my forskin over the head of my penis and recently my girlfriend has been suggesting that we have sex, but I keep putting her off because I don't know if you can have sex with your forskin forwards.<P>
Is it possible?! I don't want to put it off anymore cause she'll soon get the wrong idea and I'm too embrassed to talk about it with my girlfriend.<P>
Help!!! Is is possible for me to have sex with my forskin forwards?<P>

>if you have sex you are likely to get paraphimosis, this is when the foreskin does come over the glans (head of penis) due to the movements required, but then it gets stuck in the sulcus behind the corona of the glans and it is very painful and difficult to get it back over the head. in addition you will most likely feel embarrassed at this in front of your girlfriend and not try to fix it on the spot, this causes oedema (swelling) of the head of the penis as blood is trapped due to the tight foreskin, and can make matters worse. >sounds freaky as hell, i know, but it is the truth, don't want to scare you but be warned!<P>

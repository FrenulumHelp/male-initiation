I had a full circumcision a few months ago due to phimosis. The histology apparently confirmed BXO. I am middle aged.<BR>
>Now the urologist has diagnosed BXO on the glans - unknown cause, no treatment except surgical opening of the end of the utethra. <BR>
><BR>
>I am desperate to know any alternatives to slow the progression or even halt it.  Is Chinese Herbalism any good, for example?<P>
Chinese herbalism is wonderful - but I dont know if they`ve an answer for BXO!<P>
It might just take a few months for the glans to dry out, but ...
  <P> The best suggestion I can make is the homeopathic cure which is detailed 
    at the top of <BR>
    <A HREF="../../../library/passages/lsa.html#start">http://www.male-initiation.net/balanitis.html</A> 
    ... I saw the guy again tonight and he says its completely cured ... but homeopethy 
    is a very individually specific cure 
  <P>

I enclose a previous answer <P>
OK so BXO Balanitis xerotica obliterans, is just one of a row of balanitis variations, and balanitis and LSA are much the same thing, one medical text I found discussed whether to call it balanitis or LSA and so etc.
  <P> so for a collection of ideas please read <BR>

Full circumcision is the SAFEST method of treating infections ... Do you understand the principle?: the area must dry out - infections love the dark humid conditions presented by the enclosed area under the foreskin.<P>
To my mind alternative treatment depends very much on individual case, what degree of infection (are there merely white spots on the glans or is there a festering mass of goo?), do you have an experimental attitude to life, ... or would prefer the tried and tested solution, ... want to keep the foreskin at all costs, ... age?<P>
To what extent has the general deterioration of skin tissue led to phimosis (a phimotic ring)?<P>
----------------<P>
By wearing the foreskin retracted, one could also dry out the area, ... (this would depend, is the infection on foreskin glans or both?)<P>
What I found very interesting is the homeopathic cure, but the guy started this treatment early before any ring had developed, and he has an attitude to life which suits the whole body approach of homeopathy ...<P>
Geoffrey T. Falk (anti-circ) also has a page about balanitis on line linked with http://www.cirp.org/library/treatment/ <BR>
if you get round to visiting it and find anything useful please drop me another note  - thanks</BLOCKQUOTE> <HR ALIGN="CENTER" WIDTH="600" SIZE="1" NOSHADE>

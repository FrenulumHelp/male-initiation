       Must first say that the site had been really informative and I've truly learned a lot from it.<BR>
Had been very curious though, about my own condition ever since I read about the self-diagnosis section. <BR>
I'm presently 19, and I do seem to have a case of relative?? phimosis. I could retract my foreskin when flaccid and it does stay there. But when erected I could only retract as far as the corona and with some discomfort too.<BR>
Would really want to hear some comments and advice. A suggestion for treatment would be great too. Thanks!!

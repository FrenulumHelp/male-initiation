As an answer to: <A HREF="279.htm">Skin adhesion (or bridges) on my baby boy....</A> written by Marnie at 24 Feb 2000 22:27:56:
  <P> Marnie, it suddenly occurs to me that with all the discussion we've engaged 
    in, I at least don't have a very clear picture of the extent of your baby's 
    skin bridges, and having this would help somewhat in envisioning the actual 
    situation. So, are there 1 or 2 bridges? or 6 or 7 bridges? Or has the entire 
    cut surface where the foreskin was attached fused with the glans, all the 
    way around the corona? If the latter is the case, correcting it is more of 
    an undertaking than if there were just 1 or 2 bridges, and loosening the bridges 
    manually is highly unlikely to be successful.<BR>
    Knowing an answer to the foregoing will not, I think, change the fact that 
    something needs to be done soon, but it will give a fuller picture of the 
    extent of the problem. Hope you get the help you need soon. RJK.<BR>

    >My baby boy was cir'd at a day old. Now he's 10 months old and it appears 
    that the skin has grown back where the "ridge" should be. <BR>
    >I consulted with two different doctors and got two different answers. One 
    says "leave it alone, the skin will detach by itself"..another says "you gotta 
    rip the skin apart otherwise it will get worse."<BR>
    >What should I do? I dread the thought of putting my son through this "ripping" 
    procedure since I understand they do not use anesthesia. Is there anyone out 
    there who has been through this. I really need help cuz I've been crying over 
    this for days....<BR>

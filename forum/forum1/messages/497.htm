>>I am 18 years old. My erect penile size is close to 5 inches. I'm kina depressed here. Is there any non-surgical way to induce growth? Also how much (if at all) can I expect it to grow? Last question: Does smoking affect size and growth of the penis, wil it help to quit now? I appreciate all info I can get. Thanks<P>
There is a procedure where you cut a ligament or something, which adds about an inch to your size, but the penis cant point up when erect, it stays at a 90 degree angle. Another way is to take fat from your leg and add it, but thats risky. Best bet is to ask your doctor.

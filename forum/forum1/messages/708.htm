  <P> RESPONSE:<BR>
    I am baffled. You say "phimosis and happy". WHO is happy? You have described 
    a serious but not uncommon problem. You and your boy friend want to have sex 
    and this problem is interfering. The foreskin must be stretched using steroid 
    topical cream and regular exercise until it can be retracted comfortably, 
    or else it must be cut. At least a dorsal slit or partial circumcision may 
    be necessary but if the problem is that extreme then why go only half way?

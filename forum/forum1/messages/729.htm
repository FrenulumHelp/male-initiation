  <P> >Hi <BR>
    >It happened one time that (an accident) i ripped my frenulum but not all 
    of it just a part so that outer skin it's still linked to the head. It healed. 
    but i can not roll the skin to the boottom . I am affraid that when i''ll 
    have sex it will hurt me . What should i do? I thought to cut it just over 
    that vein of blood . an d let it heal again<BR>
    I think it would be a good idea for you to go to a doctor you czn trust and 
    let him/her take care of it for you. Taking that course, it should be possible 
    to put things right in a few minutes & let it heal, after which your troubles 
    (and worries) will be over. Good luck! RJK.

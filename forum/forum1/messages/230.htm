Nope, Dave, circ isn't a bad thing when phimosis (or call-it-what-you-will) is complicating your life needlessly.  Afterwards your glans is somewhat less sensitive, but again this is not necessarily a bad thing--some guys think it's a good thing.  A Frenchwoman who was dallying with one of the Rothschilds asked him, "How do you feel being a circumcised Jew?" (Many of the French absolutely abhor circumcision, and look at Jews askance because of it.)  His answer was, "Great!  The hygiene is improved and the reduced sensitivity prolongs the passion of the embrace!"  Of course he'd had a whole lifetime to get accustomed to the feeling and you might find it a bit strange at first, but as one who's had years of experience with it (and a sex life that has been delightful on many occasions!) I'd say, if the doc recommends it, go ahead with it: a foreskin that's giving you problems isn't worth keeping.  (On the other hand, a dorsal slit ["partial circumcision"] would get rid of the phimosis without removing<BR>
any foreskin.  (Some doctors in the USA call d.s. "the French cut"!)  Don't panic, look over the options, then full speed ahead and don't look back!  <BR>
Best wishes, Bob. <P>

    >Hi all<BR>
    >Is a circ or partial circ necessarily a bad thing?<BR>
    >I'm wary about using creams.<BR>
    >Also, I masturbate very gently - no choice - and it seems to be getting worse 
    not better.<BR>
    >Also I think its just Phimosis, but as it gets tighter the soreness is most 
    apparent where it joins the head (why can't I remember what thats called!!), 
    and this little bit is getting swollen......does that mean I may also have 
    the other condition - "???? breve"?, or is it all a symptyom of the phimosis....I 
    didn't have any problems till the Phimosis appeared.<BR>

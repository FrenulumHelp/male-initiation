As an answer to: <A HREF="865.htm">very sensitive penis head</A> written by W at 30 Dec 2000 22:03:23:
  <P> You do not mention your age but when I was younger (teens, early 20s), I 
    had the same issue. I used to cup water in my hand and pour it on my head 
    when the skin was retracted in order to rinse it off. But, as time as gone 
    on (at nearly 40), I have not had any issues with this ultra-sensitivity. 
    I guess what I am saying is that if you are young, it may dissipate with time.

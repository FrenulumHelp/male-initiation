As an answer to: <A HREF="783.htm">Need help with steroid application!</A> written by Victor at 11 Nov 2000 20:12:37:<P>
Try the the betamethasone 0.5% or Kenalog 0.1%.<BR>
The Kenalog worked for my son in less than 2 weeks and with little if any stretching.<P>

    >Hello, everybody,<BR>
    >Not so long ago I was diagnosed with phimosis. My urologist told me that 
    the only cure is circumcision. However, I decided that I would try everything 
    else possible before going ahead with a circumcision. I heard about the treatment 
    with steroids from the Internet, so I got my urologist to give me a prescription 
    for betamethasone valerate cream. Obviously, I didn't get any directions how 
    to apply it. I tried to get some advice from dermatologists but they don't 
    want to deal with that and just keep sending me back to urologists! It's really 
    frustrating. By the way, does anybody know a good doctor in Los Angeles area 
    who could help with this?<BR>
    >Anyway, I've been applying this 0.1% cream for about 3 weeks now, twice a 
    day - after taking a shower in the morning and before going to bed. I put 
    it mostly on the outside, starting from the tip over about 2 cm long area. 
    So far, I see no apparent result. From some other messages in this group, 
    I figured that people use 0.5% cream. Does that mean that it will take me 
    5 times longer to see any result? Or is there something wrong with my application 
    technique?<BR>

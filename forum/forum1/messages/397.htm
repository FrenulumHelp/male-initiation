>I 'm 19 yrs old, when my penis is flaccid I can retract my foreskin near the glandes, when erect i cannot.I saw an urologist, he visited me and said I am perfectly healty.I told him I cannot retract while in erection but he said it was normal...<BR>
>Is he Jokin'???<BR>
>Am I "normal"???<P>
no its not normal. Get yourself a prescription for "betamethasone .05%" creme. Apply it once per day to the outside of your foreskin for about 8 weeks and it'll be cured. I had phimosis until I was 18 and they told me I "HAD" to get circd (they're full of sh*t). I had the same exact thing you do: I couldnt even retract it past the pee slit while flaccid.

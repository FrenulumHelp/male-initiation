    Man..let me tell u....being "uncut" is nice in its own way (some women love 
    it...its rare, different and looks good....plus fun to play with...lol), but 
    it is also very annoying and sometimes I feel like yelling out at my parents 
    and asking them "why the hell didn't u just do it!!". Probably because they 
    didnt think I was gong to encounter any problems. After about 2 years of being 
    sexually active ( I started when I was 18....Im now 25), I realized that I 
    too was getting small micro cuts around my foreskin. Sometimes they got to 
    bad that when I took a shower, just water making contact with my foreskin 
    was enough to make me cry out in pain. I didnt know what the problem was. 
    2 years ago, I was dating this girl that was very prone to yeast infections. 
    Well, since Im uncut and that is the PERFECT evironment for yeast to grow....I 
    got infected too. I had to see a urologist and he put me on Diflucan......which 
    did the trick well. When he examined me, however, he immediately noticed that 
    there wwas something wrong with my foreskin...I didnt tell him anything...but 
    he sowed me the scarring that was there and told me that eventually I might 
    have problems......awesome doctor for being able to spot that without me discussing 
    and of my symptoms with him. Well...to this day, I still sometimes get flare 
    ups....rarely, but they still occasionally happen...maybe once every 6 months. 
    The only real problem I have is when it comes to ejaculation ! I have sex 
    alot...and I can honestly tell you that my current g/f is NOT pregnant because 
    of this problem I have. Although I have been strongly encouraging her to go 
    on the pill, she is somewhat ignorant torwards it and has not taken the initiative 
    yet......and she doesnt want to use a condom either because "it doesnt feel 
    good". Soo..we use the conventional "pull out" method as a means for birth 
    control.....go figure. It scares me beause we end up having sex right about 
    the time when she should be ovulating....2 weeks after her period begins.....this 
    has been going on for a couple of months now and she DOES NOT GET PREGNANT. 
    This also happened with my ex g/f....although she did eventually get on the 
    pill. I need to be graphic here....when I pull out and I can feel my penis 
    pulsating.....nothing squirts out.....only when I actually manipulate my penis 
    with my hand....like "milking" it...do I actually ejaculate. Why? Because 
    the foreskin is too damn tight !!! While this is a mans dream come true at 
    this point in my life....I know later on when I want to have a family, Im 
    gonna have some major problems.....thats for sure....and I will cross the 
    bridge when I get there. My foreskin feels a little too tight when my penis 
    is erect and it is retracted. It also causes the head of my penis to look 
    bigger than it actually is becuase it is bloated (imagine a cock ring if u 
    will....but for the head of ur penis.....get the picture?) This gives the 
    illsion of me having a very large fat head...which is nice =)~ lol...but at 
    the same time..where the foreskin is the tighest..it constricts the natural 
    thickness of my penis....and looks a little thin compared to the rest of my 
    penis. Im naturally thick....so this problem makes my penis look thin at that 
    tightest portion of my foreksin(rigth before the head of my penis.....when 
    of course, the foreksin is retracted. Anyways..just wanted to share with you 
    my experiences. And Im glad to know other people are going through the same 
    thing I am.....and UNDERSTAND. Id also like to thank the doctor of this website..for 
    providing information and consolation to "us" out there with this slight and 
    sometimes annoying problem. Take care....Norm in Miami </BLOCKQUOTE>

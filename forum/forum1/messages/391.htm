After you've been applying it to the tight place for a week or two, you have to continue using it, but also gently trying to pull your foreskin back with a little tension everytime you can.  The combination of the cream and stretching should work.

    > I`m 18 and having problems with phimosis since i found it, about 4-5 years 
    ago. It wasn`t really 'problems' but it is unpleasant when masturbating since 
    I can 'see' only a small part of glance and it hurts if i try to retract it 
    more. I used some cream about 2 weeks now and it doesn`t seem to work. It 
    has 0.5% betamethasone in it, i`m using it twice a day, somethimes three times. 
    But it doesn`t seem to work, or should i use it for a longer period? Is there 
    any other way, except 'cuttin' myself :(

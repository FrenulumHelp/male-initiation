Jack:<BR>
Thank you for responding to my posting. I'd like to say that I am totally reassured now, but I've had so many doctors tell me that my son needs to be <BR>
cir'd, that I don't know if I'll be able to stop worrying until he's grown and<BR>
he tells me everything's OK. Only then will I be certain I made the right decision for him.<BR>
It sounds like you are happy with the way you are, but have you ever tried or considered trying the topical steroid cream? It has a 90+% success rate.<BR>
Again, thank you for you reassurance.<P>
>> I have a complete phimosis and have had since birth. I don't believe that this stunted growth of my penis at all. It just means that I cannot pull back my foreskin which is also very long. It causes no pain or discomfort to me. However, I do agree that the glandes of uncircumcised men do generally remain smaller than those of circumcised ones. Most men, circumcised as adults  report an increase in the size of the glans.<BR>
>Chances are that your boy will find the foreskin releasing itself soon.<BR>
>From what I have read, there are relatively few cases of phimosis which persist into adult life.

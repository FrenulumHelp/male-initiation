>The ring around my glans (whatever it is called) is very sensitive. The rest of the glans is sensitive also, but not as much as the ring. I try to refrain from touching either. In the shower, the water is discomforting to the ring and I cannot wash it, and hold the foreskin over it protectively. For all of my life, I have put the bottom of my foreskin (closest to the testicles) up in between my body and the elastic part of briefs underwear, so that the foreskin covers the glans at all times(the foreskin on the back of my glans is long enough). This is the only comfortable way. Recently, I have tried to let it hang (like other men), but I cant stand it after a while. Whenever I become erect, the best I can do is clear fluid, not white cum. I am finally to a point where sex is almost imminent, and I dont know if the ring will be able to take the whole penetration process, and I cant cum. I dont know what to do and I'm scared.
  <P> If you glans is painfully sensitive, try this: get some Ambesol or any other 
    tooth ache liquid. Put a little bit on your glans. It may be a bit uncomfortable 
    so have a little bit of cold water around to pour on it. Then rub it with 
    your finger, a wash cloth, a Q-Tip or whatever for about 5-10 min. This way 
    the glans gets used to be touched without you feeling the pain. Soon you'll 
    be able to touch it as much as you want w/o pain. This is how I did it.<BR>
    Good luck! </BLOCKQUOTE>

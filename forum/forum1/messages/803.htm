  <P> The other night i was masturbating and after around 30 mins i took a look 
    at my penis and it had a big lump on it it had suddenly appeared and it was 
    like an area of puffy skin on the left side of my penis, i woke up the next 
    day and it had gone but my penis remains rather puffed up especially around 
    the top, and when i pull the foreskin back i cant pull it back all the usuall 
    way, i should note that a few months ago i was masturbating quite vigerously 
    and i split my foreskin, i went to the hospital and they sorted it out, and 
    after that it looked rather puffed up, which is what it looks like now, there 
    is no pain or discomfort or discolur etc.. i am wondering what is wrong, as 
    its gone down in puffiness since last night, but i would like to find out 
    what it is...thanks </BLOCKQUOTE>

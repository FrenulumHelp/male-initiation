Im sorry to tell you that today I had to cancel my surgery.<BR>
And the reason for it is that when I met the surgeon for the first time today he wanted to make a full circumcision and I never agreed to that.<BR>
I wanted a partial, removing some of the foreskin but he didnt want to do that.<BR>
So after all this new information I have read on this website I decided to try another urologist for another treatment.<BR>
I am not ready to remove all my foreskin, even if some urologists think thats the best solution..<BR>
I will meet another urologist in 2 weeks. I have waited so many years so I can wait a few more weeks I guess..<P>

>Bernt, when this is all over and you're fully recovered, how about coming back on line and giving a report about how things went?  It might be helpful to others with problems simmilar to yours, or it might just be of general interest to people who want to know how other guys cope with what life has handed to them.  Cheers, Bob.<BR>
>>Tomorrow I will have my surgery and Im scared.<BR>
>>I havent talked to the surgeon yet, and hopefully they know what theire doing cause I have pinhole phimosis and I feel that it complicates the surgery.<BR>
>>I have asked for partial circumcision but the urologist suggested full circumcision.My glans have never been exposed.<BR>
>>Im an adult and should have done it years ago but its never too late I guess...<BR>
>>I have been reading this website and I feel I know a lot more so I will not accept any wild ideas from the surgeon..

As an answer to: <A HREF="731.htm">Re: Bared Glans</A> written by R J Knight at 21 Oct 2000 00:42:46:<P>
I don't have any impression that Any acquaintances of my generation were skinning back. WWII probably circed some inductees. My high school class was about 85% circed. I felt hesitanr about showing up in gym class skinned back when I had been covered, so would draw the foreskin forward gym days am=nd didn't "go public with the exposed until my WWII physical. I always did and still enjoy the sight of the uncovered more. It just seems more mature and manly. The nuances in color around the glans tell me don't hide it! By the way, no gay leanings 52 yrs married to one woman.<P>
I can cover the glans and did a 3 mo trial of this to see if the "intacters were right.  My glans assumed a moister, softer look and changed in sensitivity. The change was strictly a change to an owie response replacing "that feels good" when my wife touched me. It was impossible yo be odor free with washing because the last drops of urine always soaked into the skin. I ended the experiment and am back to enjoying that exposed glans.<P>
I do feel that it is time for the MDs to again get behind this valuable alternative for the uncirced with their numbers increasing some. If we can get some rational thinking, without the hype there may be some benefit to the flaming. I understan that some Drs in Japan are doing circs by removing a skin area closer to the base of the penis rather that the tip. This makes good sense.
  <P> My foreskin was n ot particularly short. It took a few days of concerted 
    effort to achieve the convertible state. I read a comment that this was perhaps 
    more achievable if you could roll the foreskin back on itself. The exposure 
    of the glans has benefits in that it permits the corona to expand slightly 
    and be mmore a part of sensual perceptions, and the entire glans is of the 
    correct sensitivity. I feel that the tendency for the foreskin to over center 
    in either position, and moreso after puberty was (imperfectly) part of the 
    divine plan for how it was meant to be after puberty. For all guys that can 
    I endose it!>>*Enjoy*! Ive had a lifetime of this experience and heartilyy 
    endorse it and believe the medical community should endorse it as they did 
    before circ became routine. Also all "intacters and "mothers against circ" 
    etc. should be offering the suggestion to their offspring at puberty that 
    this is a very viable alternative to the covered look>John, there's another 
    term for your condition I failed to mention yesterday, less elegant, but descriptive, 
    and the one we used in the army: "skinned back." So, if you prefer, rather 
    than virtual circumcision or autocircumcision your penis is just skinned back. 
    The Lakotah branch of the Sioux Indian tribe as a whole kept their penises 
    this way if we can believe what we're told about them, and their word for 
    the adult penis translates as "foreskin pushed back." As to why the tribe 
    as a whole adopted this practice, it may be because the fully exposed glans 
    is always fairly clean and not subject to infections that can afflict an uncircumcised 
    penis that is allowed to stay dirty, as it may under field conditions where 
    water can be in short supply. If your survival depends upon being able to 
    hop on a horse and ride away at a moment's notice, you can see there's a definite 
    health advantage in having "virtual circumcision" or a "foreskin pushed back" 
    so it stays clean. (Of course, unlike the Plains Indians you yourself have 
    access to soap & water, but the Sioux often didn't!) Their neighbors the Ojibway 
    (or Chippewa)are said to have practiced genuine circumcision, cutting off 
    the foreskins of their young boys at a tribal ceremony, but the Lakotah evidently 
    were able to get the same effect by keeping their foreskins pushed back. [So 
    much for the history lesson!] Cheers, RJK.<BR>
    >>>>Yes John, there is a name (or 2 or 3 names) for it. Robin Stuart has recently 
    termed it "virtual circumcision" since the penis looks and acts as if it were 
    circumcised but is not. A doctor from Saginaw, Michigan, writing in a medical 
    journal in 1951 coined the term "autocircumcision" for it, since he thought 
    it was usually done intentionally by the owner of the penis, thus was a "self-circumcision." 
    Somewhere else I saw the term "circumcisionoid" used, meaning it was like 
    a circumcision even though no surgical circumcision had ever been done. The 
    Michigan doctor in 1951 estimated that of American men born in 1900 about 
    5% were circumcised, 15% were "autocircumcised," and the remaining 80% of 
    the 50-year old male population were uncircumcised. When circumcision became 
    nearly universal after World War II, considerably fewer boys had foreskins 
    to experiment with, so there were lots fewer men who wound up autocircumcised. 
    When I was in the army, a couple of the guys I knew there had short foreskins 
    that left the glans totally uncovered. They made no complaints about their 
    condition, lived normal sex lives (one was happily married, the other chased 
    women enthusiastically) and nobody else looked at them as if they were strange. 
    (Of course they looked more or less like any other circumcised guy.) Your 
    condition is perfectly natural in that it represents one kind of development 
    of the normal penis. In late adolescence the shaft of your penis simply grew 
    faster than the foreskin, and this left your glans permanently uncovered. 
    There is of course nothing whatever wrong with you and you apparently quite 
    wisely have left your penis alone, with the various parts staying where they 
    "want" to be. In human development, most grown men have a foreskin that just 
    covers the glans; others have long ("redundant") ones that hang over the end 
    of the penis; you are at the other end of the bell curve with a normal, but 
    short foreskin. So you can tell your girlfriend that you are just what you 
    told her, never surgically circumcised but "autocircumcised" or "virtually 
    circumcised," and you've never been cut. What you both need to do, in my humble 
    opinion, is to relax and enjoy it, and not worry about how it got the way 
    it is. Best wishes (and keep your cool!), RJK.<BR>
    >>>>>I am in my late teens and are uncircumcised but my glans is totaly bared 
    at all times. Before pubety my glans was covered, in my early teens my foreskin 
    started to retract with errections and every morning I would pull my foreskin 
    foreward over the glans, but it would always roll back as my glans had enlarged 
    now that it was free of my foreskin. In the end I gave up and left my foreskin 
    where it wants to sit, retracted behind my glans. Do many other uncircumcised 
    guys have a bared glans like this and is there a name for it as my girlfriend 
    insists that I am circumcised when I know I am not?<BR>
    >Harold, I was interested in your comment about doctors having encouraged 
    training the foreskin to stay back in the days before "universal circumcision". 
    I saw an old medical book that had belonged to my great grandfather that said 
    there was some protection from venereal disease when the foreskin was removed 
    by circumcision or was kept "withdrawn" behind the glans. Some of the woodcut 
    illustrations also showed bare glanses. The condition of keeping the penis 
    "skinned back" is of interest to me because I believe a large number of males 
    born before 1945 kept themselves like this, and yet there's been very little 
    research on the subject. All I've seen is a paper by a doctor from Saginaw, 
    Michigan, who in 1951 estimated that 15% of American men 50 years old at that 
    time were skinned back or "autocircumcised", as he put it. One reason the 
    subject interests me is that my own father had it done to him when he was 
    very young by his grandfather, a country doctor, who evidently did it to put 
    a stop to inflammations resulting from infection under the foreskin. The fathers 
    of a fair number of my schoolmates were skinned back (we boys talked about 
    it, of course), and when one of the boys asked his father about it, he said 
    it "just got that way." This may have been the literal truth, in view of what 
    you've said about tendencies of the foreskin to retract behind the growing 
    penis. While you and your contemporaries are still alive, I think it would 
    be worthwhile to collect information about your experiences, in view of the 
    immoderate statements of some anti-circers who wrongly, I believe, contend 
    that circumcision is never necessary. It might be possible to get information 
    from men who solved their foreskin problems without surgery in the days before 
    routine circumcision. I gather that you know a good bit about this subject, 
    and if you don't mind some nosy questions, I'd appreciate any answers you 
    might be willing to give. For one thing, do you know any other guys in your 
    age group who've kept their glanses bare? If so, did they do this themselves, 
    or was it done to them by the doctor, an older family member, or somebody 
    else? Have wives or girlfriends of men with a bare glans expressed a preference 
    for men with this condition? Some Maryland women filling out a questionnaire 
    40-odd years ago reported their husbands as circumcised when doctors found 
    they were not: I expect the ladies may have misinterpreted their husbands' 
    condition based on their observation of "autocircumcised" penises. I gather 
    from what you wrote that you're suggesting that if routine circumcision ceases, 
    as it already may have in California, doctors and teenagers should all be 
    informed of the potential of keeping the glans bare for controlling penile 
    problems (and pleasing sexual partners). This may be an old/new idea whose 
    time is about to come! How about your thoughts on the general idea? Cheers, 
    Bob.

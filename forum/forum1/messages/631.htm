I have just been circumcised ten weeks ago at age twenty eight to stop balanitis, which I have had ever since I became sexually active and creams ect could not cure. I have been circumcised pretty tight as my glans has been totaly bared when limp, when I get a errection the skin is pulled very tight and there is no loose skin on my penis. I find sex mostly a bit better circumcised, but find it impossible to masturbate as there is no loose skin on my penis. How do circumcised guys masturbate and how long does it take to ajust to masturbate without a foreskin?

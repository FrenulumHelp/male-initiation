Oh, it's normal all right. I tease my boy friend about it, and it's probably the reason some guys want to get circumcised. I think it's erotic as hell, though, when he gets hard, the skin smooths out, and the head peeks out to see me.<P>
>Is itnormal for the foreskin to look a little wrinkly sometimes especially after an erection and while in the process of getting an erection? My penis sometimes behaves like this, and I wanted to know if it was normal or not. Thanks.

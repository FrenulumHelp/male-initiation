I have three boys, all non-circ. I am circ. and know very little <BR>
about non circ. stuff.  This web site has taught me to have my boys <BR>
pull forward and back on their skins.  My 7 and 3 year old seem fine, <BR>
able to see the head and roll the skin back a ways, but not all the <BR>
way. My 5 year old however has only a very small hole through which to <BR>
pee, when he pees the head fills up like a balloon causing him pain, <BR>
nothing of the head can be seen.  I plan to take him to a pediatric <BR>
urologist, but being in the USA I'm afraid they will just offer <BR>
circ. as the solution.  Help.

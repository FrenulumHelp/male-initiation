Hi,<BR>
Firstly I would like to congratulate all involved with this website.<P>
I realsie now exactly what exact condition my penis has had since birth.<P>
It appears I have a major case of phimosis.I can barely pull back my foreskin , whether erect or not.<BR>
It has never caused a lot of pain but at times it can feel uncomfortable and definitely causes hygine problems. I am 30.<BR>
I am going to start stretching, something I never realised existed until I found this site.<BR>
If anybody out there would like to give me further information please reply here or email me.<BR>
I would like to know if there are pictures available.<P>
I started stretching a week ago and have already noticed my foreskin is not returning to its previous appearance. Is this normal ?<BR>
Thanks<P>

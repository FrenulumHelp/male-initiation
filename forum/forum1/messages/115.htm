and from what I understand <P>
"My doctor said the 1" over hang when hard was part of the cause of mild phimosis. "<P>
i" when erect sure sounds like a long overhang, but I`ve never heard of a problem being caused merely by a long overhang ... it would seem to me that the basic problem may still be some remnant from the ripped short frenulum which is holding this overhang forward ... ?  ... I`m unsure, maybe the question depends on the shape of glans, and there`s just a whole lot of geometrical variations, ... <P>
I feel when you talk about circumcision,  you should consider how much, - this is not a question of full circumcision or nothing at all ...<P>
otherwise no clever ideas at this stage, except read a few of the other parts of my very admirable welcome page<P>

>I'm 29 years old and still cannot retract my foreskin. After going through many sites on internet i came across the ARC forum where i think i should find a solution. My outer foreskin is pretty flexible to masterbate without any problem but i guess intercourse would be a pain. My foreskin is blocked from retracting because of very small opening on the inner foreskin, almost 5 mm. Is this what they call a phimotic ring??<P>
I guess so. Go to your doctor and ask for "betamethasone .05%". My foreskin was so tight I couldnt even pull it back past the meatus (pee slit) while soft. I started with the creme and in about 7 weeks my foreskin was COMPLETELY retractable even while erect!!!!!<P>
<BR>
>Could anyone from you having a similar problem guide me what should i do to retract my foreskin?? My girl friend doesn't know about this problem and i'm really feeling embarressed to tell her that i cannot have a satisfactory sex and its going to be more embarrassing when i actually have sex with her  :(<BR>
>Please help me out,<BR>
>thanks in advance,<P>
I started having sex while I had phimosis and it really didnt hurt me or her. But after my foreskin could go back it felt a lot better :)))) Your glans will be really sensitive so email me and I'll tell you how to take care of that problem ;)<BR>
Good luck,<BR>

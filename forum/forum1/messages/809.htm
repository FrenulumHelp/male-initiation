    Wassamatta, Charlie, don't you think the poor guy really has a problem? Or 
    is Bobby the one bugging him, in which case your point is very well taken? 
    My own philosophy is that if you have 2 functional balls & a healthy prostate, 
    you should be grateful, and have no right whatever to heap scorn on anyone 
    who's concerned over what he considers to be a problem. Best wishes for a 
    calm solution to this (and all other) questions. Cheers, RJK. </BLOCKQUOTE>

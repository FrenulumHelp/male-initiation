  <P> Hi, yeh, I get erect sometimes if the doctor is feeling my penis or foreskin 
    for a while. Just don't let them tell you that it needs to be cut off. I've 
    had that experience several times. There is nothing wrong with a tight foreskin. 
    You can stretch it if you want it loose. Just let it happen. I was given an 
    intern at my HMO and he got erect while sliding my foreskin over the glans 
    a few times. It just happens. Nothing wrong with it. Don't worry. </BLOCKQUOTE>

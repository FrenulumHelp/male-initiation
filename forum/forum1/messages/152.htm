>>I am 27 years old and as far back as I can remember my foreskin has stayed fully retracted, I can pull it forward without any problems but it rolls right the way back leaving my glans fully exposed.  Is there anything I can do to keep it pulled forward?<P>
>Mike: Speaking as a guy who got himself gratefully circumcised only after a lot of foreskin trouble, I am tempted to say Lucky You. But I see your point. I think there are quite a lot of guys like you. Sometimes one sees them described as “naturally circumcised”, though obviously this isnt really an accurate description, since they have never been cut.. I’m afraid I have never heard of any sort of procedure to tighten up the natural end of a foreskin so as to make it stay forward.  I guess it’s possible to use temporary means with bits of plaster and so on, but  even if these were used for a long period, I doubt if the skin would close up enough to stay forward. Maybe other people can be more optimistic than me.<P>

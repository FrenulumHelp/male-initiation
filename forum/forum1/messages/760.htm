hi<P>
i am an 22yr old male.<P>
i have a problem with my foreskin that i hope someone can help me with<P>
at the end of my foreskin it is very tight and the opening isnt really big enough for the head of my penis to go through so i can retract it.<P>
I can retract my foreskin so it is behind the head of my penis, but it takes a lot of effort to force it behind there.<P>
Also if i happen to get an erection when my foreskin is behind the head of my penis it is painful and like the head of my penis is being "strangled"<P>
if i try to uriniate when it is in this state it hurts and not much urine will come out.<P>
Sometimes it has taken me several hrs and much pain to get my foreskin back to its normal position after this, and if i have tried to urinate, when it finally goes back to its normal position urine comes out, i guess cause the pressure is released.<P>
has anyone got a solution to this problem?<P>
i am very scared of going to the doctor and i do not want to be circumcised.<P>
I dont know if this will cause problems when having intercourse, because i am a virgin.<P>
i can masturbate ok though<P>
thanks

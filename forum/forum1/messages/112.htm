Poor guy done a lot of research and dont get an answer! -<BR>
 problem is Bernie, nobody round here comes from San Fransisco, ... <P>
Well if you understand my theory, <BR>
    <A HREF="../../../phimosis_treatment.html#start">http://www.male-initiation.net/phimosis_treatment.html</A><BR>
then you know its a secondary phimosis and as such generally wont stretch ..., but there are obviously some specific types of secondary ring which do stretch, ... now really the only way to get a serious answer may be to write a line to dear Dr. Clemmensen, and persuade him to explain his histological examinations in plain English, or at least make a few speculative guesses on how it all relates to practical treatment ...<P>

interesting a rare report and a clear admission that you just mistreated yourself in a fit of obsession ... masturbation with a dry foreskin is often reported to rip a tight ring ... do you have a ring of tight skin, ? the typical phimotic ring?<P>

I`ve absolutely no idea .... I`m wanting the answers from you!<BR>
    <A HREF="../../../library/passages/betamethasone.html#start">http://www.male-initiation.net/creams.html</A><BR>
    there`s a thread 5 or 6 from the bottom of this page on<BR>
"betamethasone .05%"<P>
hope that helps<BR>

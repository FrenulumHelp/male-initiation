You have probably had a small rupture to one of the chambers that engorge with blood during erection (corpus cavernosum). If the bruising doesn't go away, or if you can feel a lump there that doesn't go away, then you should see a doctor promptly since a blood clot may have formed. Hopefully it will resolve itself quickly though. Best of luck.
  <P> >I was having a threesome with a male and female. My buddy and I both had 
    our penis's in his wifes pussy at the same time. She was ontop of him and 
    I was entered into her from behind. All of a sudden my buddy started to ram 
    his steel like boner in her pussy, just then I felt his cock stike mine, all 
    of a sudden I felt an odd pressure inside my penis as if air was being deflated. 
    I notice a black and blue mark on one side of the shaft of my penis. My penis 
    is sore and can you tell me what happened to my penis pysiologically and how 
    long does recooperation take?

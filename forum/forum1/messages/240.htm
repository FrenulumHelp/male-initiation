useful info. landed by arc admin. obviously meant for the public forum
  <P> I think that I may have been the recipient of an oblique dorsal slit-- as 
    I understand it. Could anyone describe this exactly, in detail. I am not sure 
    if this is what I got, but I really would like to know. Pics would be even 
    better- a picture tells a thousand words. I believe that I had this at birth 
    because I have alot of skin and the scar doesnt go all the way around, also 
    if I hold the skin together as it may have been before it kind of slants in 
    a sort of curved way as if it was performed with a curved scissors. I really 
    dont know, but if I could find out for sure - I would have the scar reopened 
    and stitched back to original. Thank You. </BLOCKQUOTE>

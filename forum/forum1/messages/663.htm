I am not allowed to advertise the clinic, but I can suggest some web sites for you to look at:<BR>
Paul Russo's site at http://net.indra.com/~shredder/restore/index.html (Paul's done it and has lots of sensible, practical advise - be wise to listed to him!)<BR>
There's an aricle on Paul at http://www.westword.com/extra/foreskin.html

Hi Dave,<P>
      Sorry you missed a reply on this one but we<BR>
      could only really have marvelled at your<BR>
      observations ... - to number 2) this must be a<BR>
      description of frenulum tightening as a result<BR>
      of the ring degenerating, after LSA losing<BR>
      elasticity - making the previously long<BR>
      enough frenulum now too short -- <P>
      but anyway - did you get the partial circ? did<BR>
      it help?<P>
      Robin<P>

      Well, I've just discovered the web site - I<BR>
      won't tell you what I asked Yahoo to search<BR>
      for - and I've found out what the problem is!<P>
      A few years back I had the symptoms of LSA<BR>
      - small white scar like nodules (how else to<BR>
      describe them!) and now Phimosis. I now<BR>
      know what they both are, after months of<BR>
      pondering (not worrying really, its easier to<BR>
      just ignore it after all!).<P>
      So I'm going to the doctor!!<P>
      A couple of questions tho.<P>
      1)<BR>
      Has anyone got any observations on their<BR>
      ability to maintain a full erection and reach<BR>
      orgasm with Philmosis?<P>
      I'm finding sex lasts longer, but I don't feel<BR>
      fully hard.<P>
      2) Although the ring feels sore all the way<BR>
      around, its most sore where its attached on<BR>
      the underside. I regularly get broken blood<BR>
      vessels, sometimes large.<P>
      3)<BR>
      PArtial circumcision?...ouch??<P>
      Once again, the site is brilliant - enough to<BR>
      restore my faith in the web!<P>
      Happy New Year<BR>
      Dave, Northampton, UK.

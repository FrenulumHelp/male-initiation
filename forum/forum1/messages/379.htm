After a lot of reading around this topic it occurs to me that in many cases "frenulum breve" may be something of a misnomer. It is not so much that the frenulum is too short, but that the ridged band - to which it is attached - is too tight. This structure seems to have only been described in 1996. See:<BR>
Taylor, J.P., A.P. Lockwood and A.J.Taylor, The prepuce: Specialized mucosa of the penis and its loss to circumcision, Journal of Urology (1996), 77, 291-295 <BR>
in the CIRP library.<BR>
This is clearly different to secondary phimosis, which involves a tightening/fibrosis of the preputial sphincter. One of the implications is that many cases of "frenulum breve" may respond to stretching/steroid cream therapy being advised for primary phimosis if it is understood that it is the ridged band that needs stretching.<BR>
Anyway, worth a thought perhaps.

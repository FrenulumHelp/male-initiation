My little brother has just been 'diagnosed' by our local doctor as having Balanitis Xerotica Obliterans (BXO). My brother's penis has had a few small cuts on the foreskin on a couple of occasions in the past and although they have now healed he cannot pull his foreskin back at all. The doctor just looked at his penis and said he would bet that it was BXO, implying that he may not have been sure. He also said that the only treatment is circumcision. Now what we want to know is what exactly is BXO? What causes it? Can it be treated without circumcision, with a cream for example? Please help!

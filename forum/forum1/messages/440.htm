As an answer to: <A HREF="438.htm">Tight Foreskin and Frenuloplasty</A> written by Andy at 01 Jun 2000 12:22:35:<P>
>I yesterday had a frenuloplasty to relieve a tight foreskin. On searching through the messages on this board and other Internet sites I cannot find any link between this operation and the relief from a tight foreskin. Can anyone advise whether they have had this operation as a relief or have I been badly advised by the physician.? 
  <P> Get yourself some "betamethasone .05%" and apply it once per day or so to 
    the outside of your foreskin from the opening tip to about mid glans (mid 
    head). In a few weeks it wont be tight anymore. You need to get a prescription 
    from your doctor for this. Print this study out and show them if they give 
    you a hard time : http://www.cirp.org/library/treatment/phimosis/<BR>
    Good luck! <BR>

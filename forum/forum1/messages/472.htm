  <P> I had a normal (not too short/not breve) intact frenulum; I injured it by 
    mistake because of a "tear with the nails" in a delirious night. I made sex 
    before and I felt a very sensitive enjoyment in the area on the top or/and 
    the underside of the glans. After a frenectomy it seems to me I have never 
    felt this enjoyment anymore: I would like to know if it is only a psychological 
    idea or this very sensitive area is on the ventral glans and the frenulum 
    tissue is like the inner foreskin layer tissue and anything more.<BR>
    The CIRP (circumcision information resources pages) explain the frenulum is 
    important for the male orgasm because of the many nerves endings triggers 
    of the orgasm / contains blood vessels to erogate the glans / stretch receptors 
    contribute to the enjoyment and maybe to the ejaculation system/reflex.<BR>
    My question to You is:<BR>
    What do you thing about? Do you know any experiences about this subject ( 
    private testimonials)? Where can I find a proven answer?<BR>
    I thank You very much to reply. </BLOCKQUOTE>

To get them in the US you need a doctor's prescription and then any pharmacy will have them.  Since you live in L.A., you have another option.  Go down to Tijuana and visit a farmacia, a Mexican drug store.  Ask for "Dermovate," it's a topical steroid made by Glaxo.  It isn't very expensive, when I bought mine (in Matamoros, across from Brownsville, TX) a few years ago it was only 66 pesos for a 40 gram tube which translates out to about $6.60 US.  The only thing you  need a prescription for in Mexico is a controlled substance - narcotics, not necessary for a steroid cream.<P>
You can have a fun day in Tijuana and get the cream at the same time.<P>
Use it a couple of times a day in very small amounts around the tight area at the tip of your foreskin (outside, not inside) - more is not better here, for a week, then in the second week, continue the small applications but also begin to gently stretch your foreskin back.  Don't cause pain, gentleness will achieve the best result.<P>
You'll see results by the end of the second week.

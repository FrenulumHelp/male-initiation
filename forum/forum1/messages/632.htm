>I have just been circumcised ten weeks ago at age twenty eight to stop balanitis, which I have had ever since I became sexually active and creams ect could not cure. I have been circumcised pretty tight as my glans has been totaly bared when limp, when I get a errection the skin is pulled very tight and there is no loose skin on my penis. I find sex mostly a bit better circumcised, but find it impossible to masturbate as there is no loose skin on my penis. How do circumcised guys masturbate and how long does it take to ajust to masturbate without a foreskin?<P>
Hi John.<P>
I was circumcised for phimosis at the age of 26.  I found that the only way to masturbate was to use a water based lubricant, which is fun anyway. Girlfriend liked it too.  It took 6 months for all the nerve damage to heal and for me to adjust to being cut.<P>
Now 10 years on, my skin has stretched - simply thro' having sex and masturbation, so that I no longer need lubricant.<P>
Good luck.<P>
Dave.<P>

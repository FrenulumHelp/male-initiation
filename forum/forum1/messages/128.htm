>>>From the age of about 11-16 I noticed that I had a tight foreskin, but i didnt notice any adhesions.  During one of my early sexual experiences I ripped some of the elastic tissue thats attached to the foreskin.<BR>

>>I am now 23 and since then the tightness has gone, but as a result I have reduced sexual pleasure.<BR>

Dear MJ<BR>
There is another possibility on this.<P>
Is this a report of Frenular rips among men with a normal length frenulum?<P>
normal length frenulums cause great pleasure ... this is very commonly reported  ... someone pulling back on their frenulum out of sheer pleasure could also rip it ...  you say "During one of my early sexual experiences" - were you masturbating or having intercourse when it ripped???
  <P> Thanks <BR>

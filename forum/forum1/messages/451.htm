As an answer to: <A HREF="450.htm">ok when flacid, but not when erect</A> written by ob at 15 Jun 2000 21:26:13:<P>
>When my penis is flacid i can pull my skin righg back, but when i am erect i cannt.  If i let it stay back from flacid to erect it hurts like hell.  I really need some god advise on what to do.  Im 19 in really worried.  Can anyone help?
  <P> Dont worry. I'm 19 and had phimosis (tight foreskin, what you have) until 
    I was 18. I was told I "HAD" to get circd but used "betamethasone .05%" creme 
    instead. Its a common and cheap steriodal creme. Get a prescription from your 
    doctor for it. Apply it once per day to the outside of your foreskin from 
    the opening tip to about mid glans (mid-head). You'll see results in the first 
    week. Overall, because mine was so tight, it took about 7-8 weeks for me to 
    get it back while erect. Yours shouldnt take that long because you can retract 
    it while flaccid, I couldnt.<BR>
    Let me know how it turns out and if you have any questions.<BR>

As an answer to: <A HREF="646.htm">Re: my penis</A> written by Allen at 14 Sep 2000 15:09:55:
  <P> Yes, this is a congenital (dating from birth) condition where the hole that 
    should be at the tip of the glans winds up somewhere else. If on the bottom 
    of the penis it's called "hypospadias," as Allen says, and if located topside 
    it's called epispadias. It can be treated surgically. I saw an article on 
    this subject in a medical textbook that said kids with the condition should 
    never be circumcised because part of the foreskin could be used in repairing 
    the existing hole while making a new one at the front of the glans. I claim 
    no expertise whatever in this area, but if it bothers you, you can go to a 
    specialist (urologist? plastic surgeon? maybe a genberal practitioner will 
    know where to refer you) to get some input on where to go from here. One thought: 
    it ain't broke, it's just how you were born! Best wishes, RJK.<BR>
    >>my penis is all messed up. the hole that is supposed to be at the tip is 
    on the backside of the head. its like i have no backside to my penis, cause 
    that is where my hole is. why?<BR>
    >Hi,<BR>
    >You have hypospadias. I have the same condition. Yahoo has 2 club for guys 
    with this condition. It can be corrected with surgery but you better join 
    these clubs to get the lowdown on surgery. Be careful of doctors. I have had 
    several doctors go bizerk wanting to fix my pee hole and cut off my foreskin. 
    I don't understand this. It interests other guys to see me pee out of the 
    bottom of my penis head. Send me your email address and I will send you a 
    picture of my penis hole.<BR>

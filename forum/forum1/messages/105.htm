>It is said that overhang foreskin is a valid medical reason for circumcision.  What overhang would be considered to be acceptable and at what length of overhang would it be advisable to be circumcised?  <P>
Alan-<BR>
I have never heard overhang as a reason for circumcision-- I have heard and read of those who attempt various techniques including some advertised on the web and magazines for lengthening overhang- but never as a reason for circumcision!- A new one each day! Maybe others have heard of this one but not here- and I thought I had heard all the reasons one could come up with for it

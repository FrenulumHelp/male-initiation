If your penis look like any of these pictures in the link below then I think its normal..<P>

  <P> <BR>
    >Is it normal for the foreskin to look a little wrinkly sometimes especially 
    after an erection and while in the process of getting an erection? My penis 
    sometimes behaves like this, and I wanted to know if it was normal or not. 
    Thanks.

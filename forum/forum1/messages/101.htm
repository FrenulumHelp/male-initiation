Huey-<BR>
for some reason unknown to me- I cannot reply to your message of 9-21 directly so will reply here.<BR>
You say you are fairly certain that you have frenulum breve-- I had that and you are right-- trimming of the frenulum away from the glans will relieve the tightness if your problem is frenulum breve (which it certainly sounds like)- trimming is very simple- mine was not removed- just trimmed away from the glans and it 'retreated' into the foreskin. I had to keep it retracted while it healed to keep it from re-attaching but it was rather simple except for trying to keep from getting an erection during healing. but it did releive the tightness <BR>
>My foreskin does hang over penis when I'm I'm not erected.  <P>
>Should I get circumcise or is there another cure?<BR>
>And would circumcise give me the pleasure of sex again  I would really hate to have knifes in me <P>
>Thanks I really appreciated it.  please respond anything suggestions or comments are welcome :)

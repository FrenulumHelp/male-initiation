Hi all!<P>
5 years ago I had my frenulum surgically removed due to problems (erectile pain) I had before caused by overly tight foreskin.<BR>
I underline that my frenulum was not damaged or sheared prior to this surgical intervention. It was removed simply sue to pain reasons.<P>
Now my foreskin is completely OK in terms of sensitivity, comfort, length, although I still feel that when my gland is exposed, the foreskin gathers in a sort of a "ring" behind my gland, which looks a little untidy, but could be a major source of pleasure for the lady as well.<P>
However, ever since then, I experience some trouble with maintaining my erection when I am to penetrate the woman's body. During freplay, oral sex, arousal, fondling etc. my erection is literally 100% hard, but often there are problems when it is to penetrate - it keeps softening.<P>
Has anyone had experience with simple cutting surgery of the frenulum and its possible effects on erection strength?<P>
It is very weird, because otherwise my erection is really good (also when mastrubating it is 100% hard).<P>
Would appreciate any comments & feedback on similar expereiences<P>

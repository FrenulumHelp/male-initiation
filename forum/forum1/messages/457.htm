  <P> You don't have any bandages on. I had one 3 weeks ago and the stitches have 
    now healed. It was a bit uncomfortable for the first two weeks, but whats 
    a couple of weeks if it sorts you out for good. I had mine done under a general 
    anaesthetic and I think I was more worried about that than the surgical operation 
    itself.

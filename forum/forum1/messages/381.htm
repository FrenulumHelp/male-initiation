>>Hi, I'm 20 years old, and some days ago, I was with my girlfriend, It wasn't the first time. My frenulum ripped from the tissue that is attached to the urinal orifice. It bleeded too much, but don't hurt too much. It was three days ago, at this time it not hurts, but I don't know if this is normal or not. <BR>
>>Any recommendation please?<BR>
>>Thanks and excuse me for my bad english!<BR>
>>PD: At this time I'm afrid to make love with her again (I mean in the near future)<BR>
>>Don't worry,Mine ripped too.<BR>
>It has healed in a few days -you'll be able to make love in a week-<BR>
>Now it's much better and I can pull the foreskin without any hurt.<P>
your not alone, mine ripped when i was 25 and I too found that my foreskin was easier to retract.  Only now (28) my glans has grown to accomodate the new found space and I'm thinking of going to the doctors to have it cut again as the foreskin has become tight again.<BR>
  I am interested to know if yours ripped completely, mine only gained about 3mm.  I look forward to your reply by email.

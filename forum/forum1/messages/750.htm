    >>When you get an erection does it hurt? if it does you might want to consult 
    a doctor. <BR>
    >Yes, does it hurt when you get an erection? if so then by all means you should 
    see a doctor. If it doesn't hurt & you have no other obvious problem, it probably 
    will do no harm to let everything alone. There is a condition called Peyronie's 
    syndrome in which the penis is somewhat bent out of shape, but last time I 
    heard, there wasn't much to be done about it. However, if your condition is 
    related to frenulum breve, when the foreskin may be tightly bound to the frenulum 
    and may be pulled downward during erections, then it should receive medical 
    attention. So, if there's no pain, you may have no problem. But if you still 
    have questions, a visit to the doctor would be very much in order. Best wishes, 
    RJK.

I'd like to start out by saying that this is a wonderful forum which has greatly helped me in dealing with my condition.<BR>
I would like to direct discussion into a slightly different aspect of this condition which many of us face.  I am 23, and I have secondary pinhole phimosis - I cannot really retract my foreskin at all.  <BR>
I don't have any problems with it physically - sexual or hygenic.  However, I dread having to explain my condition to each new girlfriend (not that there are that many!).  Clearly, it's embarrassing to discuss, especially at the often delicate and critical moment of a first sexual encounter with a new partner.  For example, what is the appropriate time to mention the problem?  Should it mentioned at all?  Basically, I fear a negative reaction from my partner upon seeing a "different" looking penis.  What I'm curious to find out (and I may not be able to here with prodominantly male readers) is how have women typically reacted to this situation?  In my case, I have asked my girlfriends if they feel it is a problem, and they have said no.  But I wonder do women generally desire a penis that is "normal," or would having "special equipment" (as one forum contributer wrote) be exiting to a woman?  <BR>
Right now I am between girlfriends, so I am leaning towards a partial circ anyway - just to avoid the issue altogether.  But I am a little afraid to go under the knife down there - especially when it works fine.  Since I am not physically bothered by my condition, I wanted to weigh all of these more physcological factors in as well before making a decision.  I welcome and would apprieciate any and all comments on my thoughts and questions.<BR>
Thanks, Greg<P>

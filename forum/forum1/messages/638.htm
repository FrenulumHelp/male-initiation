>Yeah, but I've been trying to stretch the foreskin, and it's EXTREMELY painful. We're talking can't-do-anything-else-but-sit-with-clenched-teeth pain. I mean, I pull the foreskin back, and the exposed glans immediately throbs with pain (not erect, either.) Since i never even exposed if before this year, this could be a major problem...<P>
Don't overdo it, it won't be solved in one day. Work up to it slowly, a bit every day. Leaping right in and exposing the glans first go is not going to be much help and obviously hurts like hell! <P>
Check out this page for some ideas ... good luck !

As an answer to: <A HREF="307.htm">I want to have my foreskin all the time pulled back</A> written by laurent at 05 Mar 2000 03:21:29:
  <P> Laurent, at one time (like during and just after World War II) thousands 
    of men in the United States kept their foreskins permanently retracted; so 
    many, in fact, that a Michigan doctor in 1951 coined the term "autocircumcision" 
    to describe the condition of an uncircumcised penis which appeared to be circumcised. 
    This was accomplished with foreskins which, like yours, refusased to stay 
    "skinned back" of their own accord, by pulling the foreskin all the way back, 
    as far as it would go, then rolling it inward on itself until it more or less 
    "disappeared" behind the glans, which as a result remained permanently exposed. 
    I've known a number of older men who chose to keep themselves this way and 
    apparently were totally satisfied with it. I suppose they had one of two motives 
    for keeping their penises this way: 1)they (or their girlfriends and wives) 
    wanted them to look circumcised; or 2)they found the "autocircumcised" penis 
    easier to keep clean, since no smegma or other secretions can accumulate on 
    the bare glans. The penis with the foreskin treated this way looks much like 
    a circumcised penis except that there is no surgical scar; the foreskin just 
    fits smoothly under itself behind the glans. The first time you roll the foreskin 
    up in this manner, it very probably will simply unfold and return to its accustomed 
    place, covering your glans. This can be controlled quite simply by rolling 
    the the foreskin into the location you want it to stay, then taking an adhesive 
    tape to anchor the rolled-up foreskin in place. Leave the tape on your penis 
    for a couple of days, and then when you remove it the skin will "remember" 
    to stay in that position. Btw if you change girlfriends or she wants you to 
    return to a penis like that of Hercules or Augustus Caesar, all you have to 
    do is pull the foreskin forward again so it covers the glans, and keep the 
    skin taped in that position for a couple of days, and there you are just as 
    you were in the first place. This type of "autocircumcision" has a couple 
    of advantages in that there is no surgery involved yet the result is very 
    similar to a surgical circumcision. The other advantage? It is readily reversible, 
    as a surgical circumcision is not. I think this type of penile modification 
    would be helpful to a good many men who don't have tight, "problem" foreskins 
    but would like to have a penis that appeared and operated more or less like 
    a circumcised penis, for the sake of appearance or of improved personal hygiene. 
    And would not like to take the time and trouble to put themselves through 
    a surgical circumcision. If you try this approach, I'd be interested in how 
    it pleases you (AND the girlfriend, of course!) I'd certainly suggest that 
    you try it since you yourself are not interested in becoming circumcised. 
    As a freedom-oriented Frenchman you probably don't need to be told that it's 
    your life, your penis, and your decision! Bon chance, Robert. <BR>

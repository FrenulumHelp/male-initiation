As an answer to: <A HREF="786.htm">betametason creme</A> written by Problem at 14 Nov 2000 15:57:35:
  <P> >I have been using this creme for some time and it got me some fine results. 
    I couldn`t see my glans at all and after just a week of using the creme it 
    started to get better. When it was possible to reveal almost full glens i 
    stopped using the creme. Then the phimosis showed up again, slowly. I started 
    using the creme again and it was better but does this mean that I will have 
    to use this creme whole life? And I`m not sure but it seems like the creme 
    is slower in helping with phimosis, am I maybe becoming immune on it?? Please 
    help<BR>
    I doubt you're becoming immune to the creme. It seems more likely you stopped 
    using it before the job was fully done. Another thing: once you get the foreskin 
    stretched to the degree that you can expose the glans fully, all the way back 
    to the corona, you will need to do this every day, and as often as you bathe, 
    for the rest of your life to keep the phimosis from creeping up on you again. 
    One way to keep this from happening, with minimal trauma, is to have a dorsal 
    slit made in the foreskin. You may of course have some structural problem 
    that makes you prone to recurring phimosis, in which case the d.s. will put 
    a sure stop to the problem. You might find it helpful to find a urologist 
    who can advise yhou. Good luck! RJK. </BLOCKQUOTE>

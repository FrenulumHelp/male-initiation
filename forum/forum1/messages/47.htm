>Hello Robin:<P>
>I`m glad to be corresponding with you in a truly scientific endeavor.<P>
I agree with your basic scientific endeavors, but years of medical practice are<BR>
punctuated with the fact that Medicine/surgery is an INEXACT science. That,<BR>
however, should not prevent study and research from being an on- going condition.<BR>
My belief is that there are 3 kinds of circumcision: ritual, med/surgical type for<BR>
pathology or cosmetic reasons and prophylactic. "Routine" is and should be a <BR>
MISNOMER. Until QUALIFIED circumcisers are available to ALL-- there should never be<BR>
ROUTINE surgery!! Those Orthodox Jews who believe in ritual as well as<BR>
other countless millions in this world of other persuasions do so by FAITH. My<BR>
thesis is that RITUAL beliefs have often have good scientific basis-- as the<BR>
Hebraic circumcision (please review and comment on my article Prophylactic <BR>
Neonatal Surgery and Infectious Diseases). Prophylactic (neonatal or older)<BR>
attempts to PREVENT the problems you are so clearly defining!<BR>
Hebraic neonatal circumcision done by qualified Mohels is both ritual AND <BR>
prophylactic. True med/surgical circumcisions are done for pathologic conditions<BR>
not amenable to medical therapy or for cosmetic purposes.<BR>
You should read the excellent book by P.C. Remondino, M.D. entitled HISTORY OF<BR>
CIRCUMCISION from the earliest times to the present. "Moral and physical reasons<BR>
for its performance." Anyway its a pleasure to be able to discuss rationally a <BR>
mutually interesting subject that only expands my knowlege and convictions by your<BR>
work and findings.<BR>
"Techniques in Large Animal Surgery", Second Edition by A.S.Turner et al. recom- <BR>
mend prophylactic circumcision in the bull-- an old veterinarian practice in this <BR>
country. The recommended oblique rather than transverse amputation of the pendu<BR>
lous sheath results in oval rather than circular scar (this seems to be the phi-<BR>
mosis problem you have so identified in post-adult circumcisions.)  <P>
><BR>
>>I heartily endorse this attitude and commend Robin for his outstanding work which<BR>
>>serves to elaborate so well the COMPLICATIONS of those who have not been fortunate<BR>
>>enough to have been PROPHYLACTICALLY circumcised neonatally. <P>
>I completely distance myself from this conclusion. My <BR>
>suggested modern methods of PREVENTION (which you answered<BR>
>to above) have nothing to do with "PROPHYLACTIC" circumcision. <P>
TRUE-- BUT IMAGINE HOW MUCH MISERY WOULD BE PREVENTED IF PROPER<BR>
NEONATAL CIRCUMCISION HAD BEEN DONE!!   ON THE OTHER HAND YOUR <BR>
EFFORTS FROM A VERY PRACTICAL VIEWPOINT ARE TO BE CONGRATULATED!!<P>
>The modern medical attitude and the conclusion of my study is <BR>
>that children must be checked and these conditions prevented.<P>
ROUTINE circumcision or nothing at all = this is a total fallacy!<BR>

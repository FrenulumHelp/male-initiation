>Since a lot of years I try to keep my foreskin back. We are very often at a nudist beach in Europe an my wife wants me to pull the foreskin back. That works only for two days. After this time my foreskin starts to swallow and it slips over the glans. Does anybody knows if it is dangerous, to retract the foreskin, what can happen. My wife an me enjay ist, but we don*t want to circumzise. (sorry for the mistakes, I'm from germany)<BR>
I must admit I wonder how common this situation is.  My foreskin is naturally retracted yet most <BR>
information seems to assume that either you're cut, or if uncut, always drawn forward.  You should probably try and keep <BR>
your foreskin permanently retracted while clothed - eventually the glans will expand at the rim and hold your skin back.<BR>
Also, try and feel less consious of it as that can often make the penis contract<P>

  <P> I had the same problem when I cured my phimosis. This is what I did. I got 
    some tooth ache medicine (i.e. Ambesol) and put it directly on my glans. There 
    was a slight burning so I poured cold water on it (just enough to ease the 
    burn but not enough to wash the ambesol away). That numbed it enough for me 
    to rub the glans very hard to take away some sensitivity. I did this on 2 
    or 3 seperate occasions. I also would rub it with my finger to desenitize 
    it. You'll be fine. Good luck. Feel free to email me if you have any questions.<BR>

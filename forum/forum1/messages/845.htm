So,<BR>
I have read through FORUM I and it is getting too big and its going to close soon <P>
RJKnight (special thanks for balancing out some tricky letters) and Nick (... its taken a long time for men to start<BR>
talking openly ... so perhaps leave out your generous offers to divert the public mail back to private) <P>
Then, Charles II is very welcome to be a troll on this forum, I very much like his advice, completely unbiased except :<BR>
get it done quick ... <P>
If I can set it up on FORUM 2 and if you dont object then I`d like to honour you all with coloured tags on your titles,<BR>
giving you the status of group leaders, doesnt mean you have to do anything more than you do now, just makes your<BR>
entries look more authoratitive<P>

DELETIONS<P>
I am deleting letter 628 498 and 635 the sum of which is:<P>
Haahahaha that'll teach ya.<P>
I would absolutely LOVE to play with it! What I truly long for is to watch<BR>
you getting an erection-- up close and with all of the lights on... <P>
No .. U Rancid Dicked sheep shagin' Criminal Desended Alcoholic TWAT ...<BR>
It was probably sheep shaggin that caused it ......<BR>
Ya poof it was probably a Male Sheep ..... <BR>
See Ya Gobber <P>
Also deleted the thread starting 652 referring to pics of celebrities who are circd - simply off topic<BR>
______________________________________<P>
I am deleting Bob`s 753 and 754 who answered no questions but spoke unto us thus:<P>
"I have noticed on this forum a very biased look at Circumcision from any older American males. It is important that<BR>
you are armd with the facts rather than out dated notions and old wives tales."<P>
He proceeded to post SCARE WARNINGS of "information" at <BR>
 http://www.infocirc.org<BR>
I checked out the site - quote<P>
- "The best way to care for a child's intact penis is to leave it alone." <P>
- "Frenar band or Ridged band Elastic tissue at the tip of the foreskin (between the inner and outer foreskin) and<BR>
extending somewhat on the inner surface of the foreskin that helps contract the tip of the foreskin allow it to remain<BR>
positioned over the glans. Very rich in specialized erogenous nerve receptors."<P>
- "Frenulum or Frenum. An elastic band of tissue under the glans that connects to the foreskin and helps contract the<BR>
foreskin over the glans."<P>
Well folks it looks like the next generation of uncircumcised Americans are going to be a pretty inhibited bunch with all<BR>
their erogenous nerve receptors all contracted with  foreskins remaining positioned over the glans ---- has anyone words<BR>
for the stupidity of such "information"?<P>
from letter 702<BR>
"To cut or not to cut is ALWAYS the question !!"<BR>
this was well meant but we must think deeper - by asking this question you concentrate on treatment - questions on<BR>
prevention are far more relevant <P>
Ah sigh! I am an extremist - but this surface appraisal of "to cut or not" is inappropriate ... its attractive because it<BR>
simplifies it into a drama -the culture must be aware of specific problems and individual cures  - "retract easily or not"<BR>
is a more relevant question -  by asking to cut or not cut (and anything to do with the perverse anti pro debate) allows<BR>
the culture to remain comfortably hidden and ignore the real problem  ... for how many more years ...?<BR>
______________________________________<P>
LINKS ... <BR>
it is such a shame but the pro circumcision sites have a lot more factual information but its true, see<BR>
circlist.org/cfeelcut.html .... on the instant circumcision feeling with elastoplast<P>
I couldnt find Hugh Youngs inevitably fanatical anti circ contribution on<BR>
http://www.circumstitions.com/gallery1.html<P>
And I couldnt find (unfortunately) the not quite so extremist anti circ pages<BR>
www.fathermag.org<BR>
www.foreskin.org/pin.htm<P>
I believe foreskin.org is the first anti circ site to actually put up a link to my pages - if anyone finds it I`d be interested<P>
anyway thats the end of the summary <BR>
I`ll be putting about 15 of the most interesting stories on line and presenting this forum as a ZIP form in the near future<P>
Cheers<BR>
Robin

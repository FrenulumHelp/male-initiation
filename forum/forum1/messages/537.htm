As an answer to: <A HREF="536.htm">TIGHT FORESKIN, IMPOTENCE, AND ANXIETY!!!</A> written by WORRIED dude at 30 Jul 2000 07:12:06:<P>
I am also a 19 year old male, and have the exact same problem. It is EXTREMELY painful for me to even try and pull back the foreskin. I suspect it's phymosis, but the doctor I went to gave me a cream (probably similar to yours) to try. And, like you, it didn't really help. He only gave me one other option, and that would be circumcision, but we both know that'll dull some of the nerves. However, that may be the only choice. I mean, at least sex is ENJOYABLE, rather than painful, right?

>im 18 and have never been able to retract, will this change at all in the next few years or will it continue to be like this? 
  <P> MR RESPONSE:<BR>
    If you do nothing, it will only get worse and you will become a sexual cripple. 
    See related posts and get the phimosis treated so that the foreskin can be 
    retracted fully, or get circumcized. Do not delay. You are at the sexual peak 
    of your life and you must act now.

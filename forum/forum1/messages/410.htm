  <P> Could be; I know some pretty juicy ladies. It's said as they age they get 
    less juicy. No complaints so far! Cheers, RJK.<BR>
    >>I'm mystified by the statement, "I just use lube like a cut guy." As a (happily) 
    cut guy with some years' experience, I've never had to use lube. Of course, 
    my lady friends have been pretty good at supplying plenty of natural lubricant, 
    and my constantly-exposed glans may be tough enough to permit me to penetrate 
    without any pain or problem (to either of us). Just a comment in passing. 
    Cheers, RJK.<BR>
    >Dunno, guess it depends on if your old and your skin is like leather. All 
    the cut guys I know use lube or they rub themselves or their girl friend raw. 
    I guess you just do it with juicy women.

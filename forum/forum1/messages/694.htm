  <P> Ok guys I'm 20 and had phimosis until I was 18. I was told I "had" to get 
    circd but used a common creme called "betamethasone .05%". Get a prescription 
    for it from your doctor. Heres a link to the study I found:<BR>
    http://www.cirp.org/library/treatment/phimosis/wright/<BR>
    Print it out and take it with you just in case he gives you a hard time.<BR>
    Apply it once per day to the outside of your foreskin from the opeing tip 
    to about mid glans (mid head) for a few weeks. Mine was really tight so it 
    took about 7-8 weeks to get totally retractable. Its painless and works really 
    well. If you have any questions, please feel free to email me and I'll help 
    you out.<BR>

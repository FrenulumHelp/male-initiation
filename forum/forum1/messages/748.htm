If you need to see a doctor, and apparently you do, there is no reason whatever to worry about getting an erection in his/her presence. (It probably won't be the first one they've ever seen!) These things may happen but if they do, this shouldn't prevent the doctor from looking over your tight foreskin and making suggestions about how to deal with it.  Go ahead, and don't worry about getting a hard-on!  Cheers, RJK.<P>

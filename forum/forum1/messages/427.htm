As an answer to: <A HREF="425.htm">Phimosis and treatements</A> written by Nik at 21 May 2000 09:44:02:<P>
Then you come to the right website!<BR>
You can read all about different treatments for phimosis here, I have learned a lot!<BR>
I think stretching your foreskin and using betamethasone cream could be the answer for you.<P>

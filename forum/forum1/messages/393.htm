Alright so you're saying its normal or at least common to have a bit of urine come out uncontrollably ?<P>
About the phimosis - I wasn't always able to pull it past the slit, its the<BR>
result of using betamethasone for a good 2 months now.  Most people reported<BR>
that after 2 months their phimosis was cured.  I can pull it down a good deal<BR>
but not totally, when I'm not erect and when I'm erect I can't really pull<BR>
it down much at all .. I get the feeling that this is the most that the<BR>
betamethasone is gonna get me because i haven't seen any more improvements.<P>
Anyway, my suggestion is that you should try the cream out, its cheap and<BR>
you might get better results than me.<P>
>I just wipe with a bit of toilet paper and that takes care of 90% of the problem.  Trouble is, most guys "drip" in their briefs some no matter what and women don't always wipe it all up either.  As for the phimosis, I'm tight too but pulling the foreskin past the slit hurts.

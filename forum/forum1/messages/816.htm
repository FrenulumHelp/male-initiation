  <P> >>Some time ago (years) i saw one or two black (not realy realy black .. 
    kind of brown-black) , less then 1 cm width spots . now I realize there are 
    more.. much more (more then 10 ) bigger and smoller . They don;t afect me 
    in any way but what can this be?????<BR>
    >Have it looked at immediately. Although cancer of the penis is rare, it does 
    occur. I don't mean to be an alarmist but it is better to be save than sorry 
    (asking a discussion board is not going to get you the answer - you need to 
    see a physician immediately).<BR>
    >He's right, Jon. Have it looked at straightway. Some years ago a brown spot 
    showed up on my glans. The doctor said it was inconsequential, and so far 
    it has been, but he was a urologist who had seen literally thousands of penises 
    and had a pretty good idea of what was pathological & what was not. Sometimes 
    it is very important to get expert input, & I believed this is one of these 
    times for you. Good luck! RJK.

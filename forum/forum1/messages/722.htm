As an answer to: <A HREF="190.htm">Re: Unable to retract foreskin Fully</A> written by John at 09 Jan 2000 17:58:06:
  <P> <BR>
    It may be hard to lalk Drs into anything but a routine circ but I would highly 
    support looking for a Dr that would take only a slight snip off the top that 
    would allow freedom of movement of the foreskin. By all means preserve the 
    whole underside skin, regardless of the looks of the end result. It is possible 
    with such compromise suregery to posssibly wear the foreskin covering the 
    penis or retracted (which provide near automatic cleaning and confers some 
    resistance to disease.>>i am 20 years old and live in india , ever since i 
    can remember i was unable to fully retract my foreskin...<BR>
    >I sympathise with you very much, as that is just the situation I was in at 
    your age. I eventually got circumcised, but I would have preferred to have 
    kept my foreskin if I could have got it loosened.<BR>
    >Your best hope would appear to be either steroid cream or minor surgery (a 
    dorsal slit or partial circ.). I can't speak from experience of these, but 
    there may be others on this forum who may be able to give views of these options.<BR>
    >Otherwise, you have the choice of leaving your foreskin as it is (but only 
    if it doesn't cause pain during intercourse) or having a full circ like me.<BR>

Bernt, when this is all over and you're fully recovered, how about coming back on line and giving a report about how things went?  It might be helpful to others with problems simmilar to yours, or it might just be of general interest to people who want to know how other guys cope with what life has handed to them.  Cheers, Bob.<BR>

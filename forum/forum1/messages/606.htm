As an answer to: <A HREF="527.htm">Bared Glans</A> written by John at 27 Jul 2000 13:18:41:<P>
>I am in my late teens and are uncircumcised but my glans is totaly bared at all times. Before pubety my glans was covered, in my early teens my foreskin started to retract with errections and every morning I would pull my foreskin foreward over the glans, but it would always roll back as my glans had enlarged now that it was free of my foreskin. In the end I gave up and left my foreskin where it wants to sit, retracted behind my glans. Do many other uncircumcised guys have a bared glans like this and is there a name for it as my girlfriend insists that I am circumcised when I know I am not?
  <P> MY RESPONSE: Lucky you. Mine did not retract on its own and required some 
    work and also effort to get used to. But my brother and I and a cousin and 
    others we have known have all done this, and would never want our penis heads 
    covered again. Its the best of both worlds, all the advantages of circumcision 
    with none of the pitfalls. </BLOCKQUOTE>

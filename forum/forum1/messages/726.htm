>>>Since a lot of years I try to keep my foreskin back.<P>
Why???  The foreskin is there to protect your glans from the harmful rays of the sun.  Why would you ever want to keep it pulled back?  Are you ashamed of your penis?<P>
The uncircumcised penis is a beautiful thing, leave it that way.<P>
Why do you think you lost sensitivity in the glans?  The foreskin protects it from harmful effects and from rubbing against clothing and the like.  Circumcised men have a lot less feeling in their penis than uncircumcised men, and experience a lot less pleasure.<BR>
You are lucky enough to have your foreskin - cherish it and enjoy it and be proud, don't hide it and try to look "American".

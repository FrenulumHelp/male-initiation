Hi all -<P>
Just an update - we're now working on a seven-week timeframe rather than the three weeks I found in the medical literature! I was really relieved to find that men on this forum had found that application of betamethasone could involve treatment for up to seven weeks. The Man says that he thinks there's a slight improvement still, so we shall just keep on keeping on ...<P>
Thanks for the info on the topical analgesic, too, Nick - it may come in handy! Dave is applying the cream three times a day, which I can only assume is doctor's orders. <P>
And then even if the phimosis stretches, I'm now panicking about frenulum breve! I can just SEE our first night together ... But we shall just see how we go.

>Hi.<BR>
>I recently found out about this frenulum. I've been aware of its existence for a long time but didn't know too much about it.

I am positive that I have frenulum breve and I must get the frenulum of the head. I am not yet sexually active but I will be very soon. Since I will probably increase my sexual adventures I must get the frenulum off the head before I make my sexual debut, I seriously want to avoid getting it ripped during sexual intercourse.

Dont worry! I have a friend who just had this done last month. He said it was pretty painless. They snip the frenulum and stitch it lower on the head. Takes about a week to heal. <BR>

&gt;&gt;I recently found out about this frenulum. I've been aware of its existence for a long time but didn't know too much about it. Initially I thought it was nothing but a sinew which was for some reason holding my forehead back severely, I could pull the forehead over the head but there the frenulum kept it from rejecting any further. So I just simply tried to cut it loose with a razorblade but then, of course, it started bleeding heavily and I quickly aborted the operation.

Since I will probably increase my sexual adventures I must get the frenulum off the head before I make my sexual debut, I seriously want to avoid getting it ripped during sexual intercourse. I have a couple of questions,
&gt;&gt;If I try a little harder, is it really possible for me to cut the frenulum off with a razorblade? 
&gt;&gt;I've heard about the &quot;surgical&quot; procedure. What does it really accomplish? Is the frenulum attached further down?  Can I completely remove the frenulum or is it a necessity? 
&gt;&gt;Can this operation be made on everyone, even though I have some veins rather close the frenulum? 
&gt;&gt;I would really appreciate answers and responses. 
&gt;&gt;I am rather worried.
&gt;&gt;Thanks a lot!

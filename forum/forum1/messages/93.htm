>So if I need both its a question of which one first I guess. I'm going to book an appointment with my doctor and run through the options which I have learned about here<P>
Hello Steve,<P>
2 separate operations at 2 different times is not a good idea, its better to get both done at the same time ...... <P>
I think its a good idea to go to your doctor, simply because the doctor may appreciate the situation and if not, NOW you should know enough to be able to avoid a full circumcision.<P>
The important point is that YOU feel confident about your diagnosis, to be able to make it worth a doctor discussing this with you in an intelligent manner, instead of simply prescribing an operation which you dont understand,<P>
__________________________<P>
I`m wondering about your frequent remarks that you roll the foreskin back, ... I think this is the normal situation, I copy a section from diagnosis.html<P>
Introductory Remarks for Self Diagnosis <BR>
To a man who has never retracted his foreskin, it appears to be made from one thick layer of skin, similar to the tongue or an ear lobe. This is not the case. There is no joining tissue between the outer and inner surfaces of the foreskin, the inner and outer foreskin are one continuous layer or sheet of skin which is folded back on itself. What is meant by retracting the foreskin, is that one pulls back on the outer foreskin. The inner surface of a healthy foreskin, will roll out from underneath and spread back evenly over the shaft.<P>

Good luck with the doc.<BR>

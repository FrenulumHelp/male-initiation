I have read the site and found it quite helpful but I need some advice.<BR>
I'm 18 have just started university and of course I want to start pursueing<BR>
a sexual relationship now that i'm away from home.  The only problem being that<BR>
I have a tight foreskin.  When flaccid (I think thats the term) my foreskin <BR>
retracts easily over my glans but when erect the most I can pull it back is to <BR>
reveal 1-2 cm of my glans.  The thing responsable for this is a part of my inner foreskin <BR>
about 2 cm in length which is very tight.  When I do pull it back I get the hourglass <BR>
effect.  There is also a small length of skin attaching my glans to the foreskin which<BR>
is just under the opening on my glans and this is about half a centimetre in length.<BR>
I went to see my local GP about this when I first noticed it around the age of 17<BR>
(My puberty was later than average) and the best advice I got was pull my foreskin <BR>
back every now a and then and wait and see what happens.  I never really took the advice <BR>
to heart and only occasionally tried pulling it back.<BR>
Any help on diagnosis and treatment (apart from circumsicion which i'm not enthusiastic about) <BR>
I would really appreciate before I get desperate and go to a GUM clinic.<P>
Thanks Bob

Hello Tom,<P>
>Firstly I would like to congratulate all involved with this website.<P>

>It appears I have a major case of phimosis. I can barely pull back my foreskin , whether erect or not.<BR>
>It has never caused a lot of pain but at times it can feel uncomfortable and definitely causes hygine problems. I am 30.<P>
Hummm I was 43 before I realised, sort of screws up the sex life dont you find? but at least I havent got piles and I never had pimples ...<P>

>I would like to know if there are pictures available.<P>

<A HREF="../../../conditions_index.html#start">http://www.male-initiation.net/phimosis.html</A><BR>
towards the bottom of the page there are links to both the pro and the anti circumcision sites with pictures<P>
------------------<BR>
>I realsie now exactly what exact condition my penis has had since birth.<BR>
>I started stretching a week ago and have already noticed my foreskin is not returning to its previous appearance. Is this normal ?<P>
yes - its a primary ring, a congenital primary ring will usually stretch, unless it rips becoming fibrous ... you should read the two or three sub files on this, if you go back to phimosis_treatment.html and follow the links on stretching,   ... (drop us a line when the process is through with any extra ideas you may develop on how to stretch ... eg. do showers help? ) <P>
>If anybody out there would like to give me further information please reply here or email me.<P>
I`d welcome it if you found fellow stretchers and communicated here with each other.<P>

>Sounds more like frenulum breve, where the tissue at the bottom of the penis head (frenulum)is too short & binds the foreskin to the bottom of the penis.  It's usually not life-threatening but can be a damned nuisance.  Taking it to a doctor you know and trust (if there is such a one nearby) is a good idea.  If you don't know such a doctor, now's a good time to find one.  Best wishes, RJK.
  <P> Thanks a lot for the info<BR>
    I am now pretty sure that my frenulum breve is too short which makes it hard 
    to pull my foreskin back all the way.<BR>
    Is this worse than Psimosis well yes and no I looked up some web-sites and 
    it only needs a 20 minute op but on the other hand you can't use creams to 
    cure it.<BR>
    As for asking a friend to show me what his penis looks like...well he may 
    get the wrong idea:)<BR>
    BTW If they cut it off wouldn't my foreskin drop down!

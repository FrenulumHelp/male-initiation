Hi DD:  Your closing sentence was "I just wondered if it is likely to interfere with intercourse? I don't exactly want to grab a girl and "test" it on her you know."  If you -don't- want sex, there is your answer.  Something is not normal, something is not right.  Ultimate sexual pleasure and satisfaction can only be reached when you have access to the penis head to stimulate it directly.  Doing so through the foreskin is like having sex with your slothes on, watching a movie with a bag over your head. or going to the opera with ear plugs.  A common cure for phimosis is circumcision.  However, you may be able to avoid this if you can get your foreskin loosened enough to make it retractable.  After a hot bath, to make the skin loose and plyable, you can apply certain steroid creams or ointments to the outside of the foreskin near the end, and then begin stretching it back as much as possible but not to cause pain or injury.  This may take frequent or regular attempts over a period of time to make it gradually loosen up more.  Complete retraction so as to expose all of the penis head is the only acceptable goal. Your desciption of the problem sounds like phimosis due to the foreskin opening being too small, but there is also the possibility that normnal childhood adhestions of the inner skin to the penis head have not released and seperated, and that is a different condition that may require medical treatment.  Let us know how you progress with this.  Down below are some messages with the names of the creams and ointments and salves that you can try.

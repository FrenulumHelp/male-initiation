Hi Steve<P>
>>... as some degrees of phimosis are difficult to diagnose when flaccid especially when combined with frenulum breve then I would advise first getting the frenulum seen to and then you would be able to see clearly if you have any degree of phimosis ...<P>
>I am sure there is phimosis as the opening just isn't big enough to roll back at all when the penis is anything more than flaccid - and if I have it rolled back and I get and erection its not a very pleasant feeling and there quite a narrowing right behind the head<P>
Frenulum breve can be so short that it stops retraction, it causes the appearance of a phimosis and is still sometimes treated with circumcision, I have had one case of this quite recently so be careful about your diagnosis, ... <P>
We cant expect urologists to have studied every possible malformation of the foreskin when erect - they don`t get the opportunity .... if you go to a urologist complaining of phimosis then you`ll get a circ ... you need to be sure of your diagnosis, <P>
The only form of phimosis which you need worry about is a phimotic ring, aparrently from your descriptions you have none. What I suspect is that your frenulum is of the type which branches out like the roots of a tree, and your tree roots are too short, and this is causing the narrowed opening ... you need pruning ... <P>
I believe what you describe is what you see always: the effect of the foreskin which wont retract, - I`m pretty sure the cause of this is the frenulum, <P>
Your descriptions are too vague for me to be 100% sure that you haven`t any trace of phimosis, ... but if underneath the glans, the outer foreskin is connected right up front to the glans then this is something clearly not normal, and I still hold to my advice that the frenulum is the main problem and if you get this fixed then you`ll be able to see if you`ve any phimosis.<P>
have you read and do you understand<BR>

You said you wouldn`t mind going private, hummm well Dr. Cuckow in London must be the expert but we`re talking about &1,200 for an op. or &125 for a consultation, now what I`m thinking is it might be worth a consultation for you to get my diagnosis confirmed, ... (or naturally rejected?)<P>
I can guarantee with a partial circ. your problem would still remain, maybe on the other hand you`d like a partial circ. but that is purely a cosmetic question ...<P>

Hello Steve,<P>
Firstly I condone Bob`s idea: "possibility is that you may have had a phimosis or some other problem that needed help and your parents opted for d.s. as less traumatic that circumcision, which it definitely was." <P>
To my knowledge the operation you`re looking for is unresearched. To my thinking the scar wounds could make the resultant resewn foreskin too tight. The only suggestion I have at present is plastic surgery. In this field there is a Dr. Cuckow in London doing plastic foreskin surgery at around 1.200 pounds sterling - I imagine similar treatments could be found in the USA, - <P>
As dorsal slit appears to be an appropriate cure for phimotic ring, can I ask what disturbs you about your dorsal slit, is your dislike personal or do you consider it inadvisable for other men with foreskin complaints?  how long is the slit? <P>
good luck<BR>
Robin

Hi Jay<P>
>If stretching will break the frenulum breve , will it break the frenulum breve that is connected to the head, which would cure my tightness?<P>
It should depend on where the weakest point is in your frenulum, ... but its not quite as simple as that, some thicker sorts of frenulum do not rip --- as Peter said:<P>
>>In my case it was a very painless and bloodless business, though I know other people have found it painful. I guess it depends on how thick your frenulum is. Mine wasnít very thick. <P>
>Also is there another cure besides a zplasy or circum??<P>
circumcision does not cure frenulum breve<BR>
    <A HREF="../../../frenulum_treatment.html#start">http://www.male-initiation.net/frenulum_treatment.html</A><BR>
is full of ideas --- the link to "The Complete Frenulum Studies" completes the picture, ... my opinion...: an incision is the easiest!<P>
Cheers <BR>

>>>Jack +Jay. Hi<P>
>>>When you stretch frenulum breve it will rip, ... no-one has ever recorded successful stretching, .. I know its advised on some anti circ sites - but feel this is theory rather than practice, I`d be interested to be proved wrong on this point - it would probably depend on how thick etc. the frenulum is, <P>
>>>If it could stretch then this would be most successful when the skin structures are still developing. This would be the case particularly in infancy through the natural stretching of the foreskin which children who have the freedom of movement to do this usually enjoy.<P>
>>>Robin<P>
>>I’m sure Robin is right, and the tissue of the frenulum is a lot tougher than the sort of tissue that produces phimosis. In my own experience I was able (with some difficulty) to stretch my phimosis, but my frenulum never stretched even a tiny bit in spite of lots of manipulation and eventually it just broke.  In my case it was a very painless and bloodless business, though I know other people have found it painful. I guess it depends on how thick your frenulum is. Mine wasn’t very thick.

Hi Max,<P>
>First, let me say that this is by far the most helpful site I've ever encountered on a single subject.<P>
Well thanks a lot, do i get a prize?<P>
>I'm 18 years old and I belive I may? have phimosis. I can't remember excatly when I diagnosed myself with the condition, but it's been like this for some years now that I think about it.<BR>
>During an erection the foreskin is tight around the gland <P>
OK first when you try and impress doctors with your knowledge, the gland is actually called the glans ... it is another little stone in the path of many, ... I always used to think it was called "gland" and this indicated some sort of hidden essence like any other gland ... <P>
The hourglass effect "for some years now" is a secondary ring, sorry all eyperimentation so far confirms that they wont stretch, a partial circ. or dorsal slit are suggested as easy cures (see phimosis_treatment.html)<BR>
 <BR>
>I can retract the foreskin when flaccid quite easily, but the foreskin slides back up when released. <P>
This indicates frenulum breve, and you need to watch out if maybe you have a mixture of the two conditions - please confirm if you have ... I have never heard this "sliding forward" description with only phimosis ... <BR>
    <A HREF="../../../frenulum_breve.html#start">http://www.male-initiation.net/frenulum_breve.html</A>
  <P>
If you have a combination some doctors may want to do a  full circ. this is your own choice but unecessary - you will need a frenoplasty and partial circ - all further on treatment is on line ...<P>
<BR>
>When I retract the foreskin in the placid position the hourglass effect occurs. As you've described the extents of phimosis, I think I have the moderate version of phimosis ring(could be partial?) <P>
yes you have the middle sized version - a partial phimosis, <P>
anyway welcome to the world of taboos and good luck<BR>
Robin<P>

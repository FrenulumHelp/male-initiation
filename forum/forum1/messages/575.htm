  <P> >I have a tight foreskin and know I must see a doctor but I know an erection 
    will occur under examination as I have erections very easily. What can I do?<BR>
    >Has anyone had an erection at the doctors? Please help.<BR>
    Don't concern yourself with getting an erection in front of a doctor- it is 
    normal and he/she will likely want to see just how tight it is during an erection 
    anyway. I have had erections during examinations and some doctors comment 
    on it and others don't- it really doesn't make a lot of difference to them 
    - so just let it do its thing- either just hang there or aim high!<BR>

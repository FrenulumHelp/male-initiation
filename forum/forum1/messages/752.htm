>if you have sex you are likely to get paraphimosis, this is when the foreskin does come over the glans (head of penis) due to the movements required, but then it gets stuck in the sulcus behind the corona of the glans and it is very painful and difficult to get it back over the head.  in addition you will most likely feel embarrassed at this in front of your girlfriend and not try to fix it on the spot, this causes oedema (swelling) of the head of the penis as blood is trapped due to the tight foreskin, and can make matters worse.<BR>
>sounds freaky as hell, i know, but it is the truth, don't want to scare you but be warned!<P>
Really that is the biggest load of grabage i have ever heard.<BR>
It has never been an issue for me, never happened!

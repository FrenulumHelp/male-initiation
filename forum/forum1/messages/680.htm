  <P> I am not aware of an artery down there. The frenum is the stretch of skin 
    that connects the cock head below the pee slit to the shaft, and that is usually 
    what gets torn. It is advisable to keep the foreskin stretched back as much 
    as possible to allow the torn skin to heal in a separated state, without growing 
    back together as before, or else it will only tear again. It is popular in 
    South America instead of circumcision to have the frenum surgically cut to 
    allow the foreskin to easily stay pulled back or forward. You may be be able 
    to use this accident to the same advantage if you do not let it grow back 
    together at the tear. If it is painful right now, try putting bandage or gauze 
    with neosporin on the place where it is torn, to aid healing and also to protect 
    it from abrasion while it is still sore. </BLOCKQUOTE>

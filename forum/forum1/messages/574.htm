Sometimes one sees them described as “naturally circumcised”, though obviously this isnt really an accurate description, since they have never been cut.. I’m afraid I have never heard of any sort of procedure to tighten up the natural end of a foreskin so as to make it stay forward.  I guess it’s possible to use temporary means with bits of plaster and so on, but  even if these were used for a long period, I doubt if the skin would close up enough to stay forward. Maybe other people can be more optimistic than me.<BR>
>>Lucky you!!!<BR>
Hi-<BR>
I suspect a lot of men have the "short" foreskin and some feel lucky to have been born that way. My brother is the same way while I have a fairly long overhang foreskin. <BR>
If you want to elongate it- try going to the net for some of the groups who were circumcised at birth and are trying to restore their foreskins. There are a number of those on the net. Just search for restore foreskin and you will find plenty.<BR>
good luck either way<BR>

&gt;Hi-
&gt;I suspect a lot of men have the &quot;short&quot; foreskin and some feel lucky to have been born that way. My brother is the same way while I have a fairly long overhang foreskin. 
&gt;If you want to elongate it- try going to the net for some of the groups who were circumcised at birth and are trying to restore their foreskins. There are a number of those on the net. Just search for restore foreskin and you will find plenty.
&gt;good luck either way

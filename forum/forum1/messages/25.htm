>hello, I recieved a dorsal slit as a child. I believe it was an obliqe dorsal slit. It was done without my permission and I want it reversed. I have finally gotten the nerve to consult a couple of doctors and have been met with total disregard for my feelings. they cannot comprehend why I would want to do this. I want to have the original scar re-opened and put back to its original position and stitched. Does anyone out there have a dorsal slit- has anyone tried to have it repaired- how did you find a doctor that isnt arrogant as hell- does anyone have before and after pictures? I havent been able to get any information about this in 5 or 6 years. am I totally alone on this????? If you can help me I would greatly appreciate it. Thank You Very Much! Steve<P>
While I know very little about a dosal slit, I do think the suggestions that a plastic surgeon would likely be the best bet sounds good. I doubt that many urologists have performed anything to repair a dorsal slit.<BR>
I also think your desire to keep the foreskin is good. I have never for one minute regretted keeping mine! The stories about cleanliness are in my opinion overblown, as merely retracting during urination will keep it mostly clean and normal washing should do the rest. I started retracting to urinate at about age 6 when my Grandfather told me I should- and have never had the problems I see discussed on keeping clean. </BLOCKQUOTE> <HR ALIGN="CENTER" WIDTH="600" SIZE="1" NOSHADE>  <CENTER>

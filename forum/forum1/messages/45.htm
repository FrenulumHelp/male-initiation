>Hey, i am an 18 year old who cannot pull back my foreskin at any time at all.<BR>
>This has been around since i was about 12 i think but i can't really rememeber.<BR>
>When it first started i would have an erection and pull back the foreskin which would then bleed a bit but be able to go back down the shaft. I haven't done that since i was about 12 and don't want to do it again but i was wondering what i could do so that i can pull back my foreskin as the hole is only about 6 or 7 mm across and i cannot seing this as being natural or good.<BR>
> I have been thinking about geting it checked out to see what could be done but i saw this site and was wondering if i could get any info from you, i haven't been able to understand fully from all it here. I do not want to get circumsized as i have read this is like cutting off finger tips and removes a lot of senses so i was wondering if there is any way that i can have done without circumsion. Is there any way without surgery at all? I would apperciate any information or help from anyone on this as im getting a bit sick of it and want to get it fixed once and for all.  Thankyou very much, this site has been a lot of help, hope to hear from you soon, Thanks<P>
Wow, you have a penis just like mine. My hole is a little bigger, but your must be maybe<BR>
pencil size?  Can you see the cockhead at all in there? The piss-slit?<BR>
What happens when you masturbate, do you have to squeeze the ejaculate out?  I do...<P>
I am 44 and have not had problems with mine, in fact I like it, but<BR>
we can talk if you want.  Would like to exchange pix maybe so you could<BR>
see what mine is like.

This is all too common, and yet another reason why circumcision is not an appropriate treatment for phimosis.  You can correct it - and many men coming to my clinic have to - by shaft skin stretching as in the early stages of restoration.  But the real problem is that once you bugger it about, you're stuck with any undesireable results.<P>
Any one else in that position should make it totally  clear to the surgeon what he can and cannot do - it's your dick, not his, at the end of the day!

I believe I have seconday relative phimosis.  Most likeley a <BR>
fibrous type. The foreskin retracts wihtout problems when the <BR>
penis is in the flaccid state, however I have problems with <BR>
the retraction when I am erect.  <P>
Intercourse is painful, and it's something I need to get resolved.<BR>
I do not wish to be circumcised -- at least not all the way.  I<BR>
reside in San Francisco (Bay Area), and would love to hear of <BR>
any Urologist or practitioner I can go to that will diagnose the <BR>
condition himself, and help me find minimal treatment.<P>
I've allready been to a Urologist who told me to put hand-lotion <BR>
on the area, and return in 3 months.  He said the only other <BR>
alternative was circumcision (which I know is not true).<P>
History:<BR>
I didn't have this problem until later in life.  I remember <BR>
masturbating quite happily when I was 23.  I had no idea that <BR>
this type of thing could happen, so I was a bit rough with it<BR>
at times.  I clearly remember chaffing it becuase I wanted <BR>
that orgasm so bad that I just kept on going -- even when the<BR>
penis / foreskin was dry.  <P>
I just thought it will heal over time.  I guess I didn't wait<BR>
long enough for it to heal all the way, and kept on misstreating<BR>
it.  I wish someone would have told me that this was a danger,<BR>
and that I should be very carefull to stay lubricated when <BR>
masturbating.  Grrrr!<P>
I'm 28 now, and have problems with intercourse.  I'm applying<BR>
skin lotion on it... it's getting a bit better I think, but it's<BR>
definately still a problem.<P>
Question:<BR>
Has anyone every tried some type of steroid skin cream, or some<BR>
other topical chemicals that can be used to restore skin?

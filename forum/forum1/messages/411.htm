My girlfriend feels that we are ready to have sexual intercourse with each other, which I feel is right as we are now both 16.  The problem around this matter is that I have been a sufferer of phimosis for as long as I can remember and have not had intercourse yet.  As a result of phimosis my glans is also hypersensitive making it impossible to touch.  Is it still possible for me to have penetrative sex?  My girlfriend does not know that I have this problem.

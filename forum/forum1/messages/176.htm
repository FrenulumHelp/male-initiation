Hi!  Got wind of your concerns.  There are a few things you can consider doing prior to surgery (I figure if you were born with somthing, perhaps it would be a good idea to hang on to it....)  Anyways - Had much the same problem a while ago until I came across Robin's site - the information here has helped me to put things in perspective (gave me an understanding what this is all about) but also opened my eyes to different options available to you.  
  
 <P> There are two links here you might consider looking at - the first 
  one talks about stretching in general <A HREF="../../../phimosis/stretching_lsa.html#start">http://www.male-initiation.net/ltr_stretching.html</A>)- 
  helps to understand when and how stretching (although a little uncomfortable 
  at first) will work (it's the kind of thing you have to do on a regular 
  basis - it gets easier as it goes along). The second link <A HREF="../../../library.html#start">http://www.male-initiation.net/library.html</A>) 
  deals with other treatments available to you. Hope it helps! 
 <P> Paul

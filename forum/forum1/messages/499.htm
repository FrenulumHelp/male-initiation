Written by PS at 16 Jul 2000 14:47:37:<P>
I had a normal (not too short/breve) intact frenulum; I injured it by mistake because of a "tear with the fingernails" a delirious night. I made sex before and I felt a very sensitive enjoyment in the area on the top or/and the underside of the glans. After the frenectomy it seems to me I never felt this enjoyment anymore: I would like to know if it is only a psychological feeling or this very sensitive area is on the ventral glans and the frenulum is like the inner layer tissue and anything else more.<BR>
The CIRP (circumcision information resources pages) explain the normal frenulum is important for the male orgasm because of the many nerves endings important triggers of the orgasm / contains blood vessels to erogate the glans / the stretch receptors contribute to the enjoyment and maybe to the ejaculation system/reflex.<BR>
My question to You is:<BR>
What do you thing about?<BR>
Do you know any experiences about this subject (private testimonials)?<BR>
Where can a find a proven answer?<BR>
I thank Robin Stuart or some experts to reply.

As an answer to: <A HREF="668.htm"> dorsal slit 12 weeks ago - still my head is too sensitive to touch</A> written by Bernt at 19 Sep 2000 01:03:58:<P>
i don't have the same problem yet, as i am just at the stage of starting to do something about my phimosis.  but i have heard people talk about using a mild topical anaesthetic on the skin so it gets used to being touched without the pain.  some of these are oil of cloves, or various toothache or children's teething lotions, i spose you get this stuff from a chemist - have a look around.  after a while the sensitivity will be reduced no matter what you do, it just takes time, keep trying (gently) and it will recover without a doubt, it's like people wearing contacts - they can't bring themselves to touch their eye at first, but before they know it they are pushing and pulling the lens all over it!  best of luck.<P>

  <P> >I had pinhole phimosis all my life and never been able to touch the head 
    of penis until after I had my surgery 12 weeks ago. Im 30 years old. I have 
    been told that gradually the feeling in the head will be less sensitive. But 
    its very hard for me to touch the head. Theres no problems to masturbate when 
    the foreskin covers the glans but its impossible to touch the head with my 
    hands, and if I try Its very painful and I lose the erection. Also when not 
    erected it hurts when the tip of my head is touching my underwear. <BR>
    >Any other with similar problems? I appreciate your answers.<BR>

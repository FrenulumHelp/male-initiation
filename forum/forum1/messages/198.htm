I'm new here and I don't want to step on any toes or offend anyone by plastering my name all over this board, but I just read an account of an adult circ and I<BR>
found it very disturbing. I know that sometimes circumcission is the only option, but Topical Steroid Cream (Kenalog 0.1%) is successful in loosening the foreskin more than 90% of the time, making circumcission unnecessary.<BR>
This info was difficult for me to find when all the doctors we were pushing for my son to have a circumcission and I would hate to think of anyone going through painfull surgery just because I was remiss in sharing this info.<BR>
I know now, after hearing from men on this forum that it is possible to live with phimosis comfortably and happily, but for those men who need to resolve it<BR>
here is a far less painfull alternative to circumcission. </BLOCKQUOTE> <HR ALIGN="CENTER" WIDTH="600" SIZE="1" NOSHADE>  <CENTER>

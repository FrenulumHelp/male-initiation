>Ok, well, I'll visit a doctor next week, as said. But the thing is that I need this done very soon. How well known is this so called 'frenulum trim' ? Is it a standard procedure? Do you think there's any possibility for me to get it done on the day I visit the hospital or is there generally a need for making an appointment?<BR>
Pete-<BR>
When I had mine done- I specifically asked if he could trim or clip my frenulum on the visit and was told Yes. Therefore when I went in - the nurse immediately prepared me by rubbing some numbing lotion on the area. The doctor then gave me a pain killer right into the frenulum area with a very tiny needle which I did not feel. He then carefully trimmed it away from my glans. Mine had attached all the way to the opening of the pee slit. He then told me I should try to keep it "skinned back" while it was healing or to at least retract it often enough to keep it from reattaching. The whole thing was over in about 10 minutes and I went on my way. <BR>
I lived with mine for 24 years before I had it done- there is no need to be in such a rush that you do something that would damage your penis- <BR>
take care - let me know if I can offer any more<BR>

>I've been reading some on the net the last couple of days and have heard about several who ripped it during sexual intercourse. I find the frenulum disturbing and would gladly remove it entirely. It's seams, from what I've read, (I have not spoken to a doctor)  as if the loss of the frenulum doesn't cause any significant damage. It seams as if it's serving no real purpose.  Anyway, thanks again.<BR>

>>>Thanks!<BR>
>>>It doesn't seem that hard to "clip" it though. I will most likely see a doctor next week but if I can't get it done professionally, I think I will personally try again since I must get this done in the very near future. What scares me though is that I'll "clip" away something important. Does the frenulum serve any purpose other than holding on to the foreskin? Does it contain any vital blood veins? If I decide to do it myself, can I clip the entire frenulum off or does it have to be attached somewhere? I find it rather disturbing and would preferably loose the entire thing. Is that possible?<BR>

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Thanks!
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It doesn't seem that hard to &quot;clip&quot; it though. I will most likely see a doctor next week but if I can't get it done professionally, I think I will personally try again since I must get this done in the very near future.

&gt;&gt;&gt;There is quite a bundle of nerves in the frenulum- some contend these are very important. I would urge you to not try to sever the frenulum yourself. The doctor will likely carefully trim away from the underside of the glans or head and the frenulum trimmed away will retreat into the inner foreskin leaving the nerves intact- if you cut the frenulum - or it is torn during sexual activity- it might also sever some important nerves and you could find a bloody mess!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I had this done- I too had tried unsuccessfully to &quot;clip&quot; mine but just with 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;my fingernails rather than a razor blade.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I am glad I was unsuccessful since I had it done by a urologist. He trimmed 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;it completely away from the head and it healed with no scar. My foreskin now 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;moves back all the way as it should.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Don't try to do it yourself- get to a professional and it will be simple and 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;practically painless and will heal quickly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If you are in the US, I can almost assure you, your doctor will tell you that you need to be circumcised- just hold firm and say &quot;NO&quot;- all you need is the frenulum trimmed!

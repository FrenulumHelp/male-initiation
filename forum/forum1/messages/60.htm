Hello Todd,<P>
Sorry in Brisbane no ideas. (Hey you speak English almost as good as we can :-)<BR>
Yes .. It is very common just very embarrassing -I`ll bet some of your best friends have had problems and just never told you <P>
<BR>
> The foreskin was bleeding cause the skin ripped if i remember right, that way i could pull it back but then it would seal back up again and i don't really want to do that ever again.<P>
Thanks for confirmation of this ... so the ripping was happening when you were 12 13 yrs. old, ... must gave been pretty scary, ... care to tell us .. ?<P>
> Dorsal slit sounds the better alternative<P>
should be relatively easy to find a doc to do this, but keep an open mind on the partial circ. dorsal slit should work well for relative phimosis , a small slit to create a little more space, a longer slit would create more space ... anyway your phimosis may be too tight so I advise you keep an open mind ... find a doctor you like (also with an open mind) and see what he suggests.<P>
Good Luck<BR>

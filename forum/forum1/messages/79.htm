Hello Miguel<BR>
You`ve got a tricky one there - I can answer questions about anatomy with competence, but with questions about infections and in a case where maybe the diabetes would have some special effect - all I can really do is send you a lot of varied info and let you evaluate it ... <P>
Diabetes and phimosis have certain connections, but it seems if you`ve already got diabetes, then it wont lead to phimosis - see Chopra.<P>
And I have copied out a previous answer on balanitis, <P>
-----<BR>
I was trying to learn about diabetes because at sometime someone with phimosis will want to know a few simple symptoms, ... I believe it works like this: could you confirm or add<P>
The pancreas goes kaput, doesn't produce insulin, - insulin balances out the blood sugar - so excess sugar gets into the blood stream causing the kidneys to work overtime to clean up the system - dry mouth and dizzy spells are apparently the first symptoms - because of the dry mouth the afflicted person must drink lots and lots and then they urinate a lot and then often go to the doctor complaining of constant visits to the toilet. At which point diabetes is diagnosed ... and maybe also phimosis<BR>
------<P>
<BR>
anyway good luck with all<BR>

OK so BXO Balanitis xerotica obliterans, is just one of a row of balanitis variations, and balanitis and LSA are much the same thing, one medical text I found discussed whether to call it balanitis or LSA and so etc. <P>
so for a collection of ideas please read<BR>

  <P>
Full circumcision is the SAFEST method of treating infections ... Do you understand the principle?: the area must dry out - infections love the dark humid conditions presented by the enclosed area under the foreskin. <P>
To my mind alternative treatment depends very much on individual case, what degree of infection (are there merely white spots on the glans or is there a festering mass of goo?), do you have an experimental attitude to life, ... or would prefer the tried and tested solution, ... want to keep the foreskin at all costs, ... age?<P>
To what extent has the general deterioration of skin tissue led to phimosis (a phimotic ring)? <P>
----------------<P>
By wearing the foreskin retracted, one could also dry out the area, ... (this would depend, is the infection on foreskin glans or both?)<P>
What I found very interesting is the homeopathic cure, but the guy started this treatment early before any ring had developed, and he has an attitude to life which suits the whole body approach of homeopathy ... <P>
Geoffrey T. Falk (anti-circ) also has a page about balanitis on line linked with <BR>

Phimosis and Diabetes Mellitus.<P>
J Urol 1982 Jun;127(6):1101-2<P>
Abstract: The incidence of diabetes mellitus is<BR>
significantly higher in men with phimosis of<BR>
recent onset. All patients with phimosis of<BR>
recent onset should be screened for diabetes<BR>
mellitus.<P>
Materials and Methods<BR>
... There were 110 patients who had undergone<BR>
circumcision for phimosis, which was defined as<BR>
the inability to retract the foreskin behind the<BR>
corona of the glans penis. The phimosis was<BR>
classified as of recent onset (<2 years) or of<BR>
known long duration (>2 years). ....<P>
Results<BR>
There were 72 patients with phimosis of recent<BR>
onset, 26 of whom were diabetic, for an<BR>
incidence of 36.1 per cent. Of the 26 patients<BR>
with diabetes 7 had not been diagnosed<BR>
previously. All 7 patients were <60 years old,<BR>
which appears to be the most likely age at<BR>
presentation ...<P>
Discussion<BR>
... until 1973 no case of phimosis and diabetes<BR>
was reported in the urologic literature. ... Cates<BR>
and associates ... reported a 31.8 per cent<BR>
incidence of diabetes mellitus in patients<BR>
presenting with phimosis of recent onset, ...<P>
With few exceptions, the histological study of<BR>
tissues removed at circumcision were either<BR>
unremarkable, or showed mild, chronic,<BR>
inflammatory changes with or without<BR>
lymphotic infiltration. No description of the<BR>
histologic examinations of phimotic foreskins<BR>
was found in the literature.<P>
From our study it appears that there is a 36.1<BR>
per cent chance of diabetes mellitus in patients<BR>
between 17 and 59 years old who have phimosis<BR>
of recent onset. It is suggested that all men<BR>
presenting with phimosis of recent onset should<BR>
be evaluated for diabetes mellitus.<P>

Hello Sue<P>
you seem to be describing either a skin bridge or maybe frenulum breve<P>
>my son is 4 years old he was circumcised when he was a baby his <BR>
>foreskin is stuck to the head of his penis .. it has been this way <BR>
>for as long as i can remember i have worried about it but i have ask <BR>
>other people in my family about it and if i should take him to the <BR>
>doctor about it but they all tell me it will take care of its self <P>
Without an examination I can only guess but both a skin bridge or frenulum breve will most certainly not resolve by itself and will, as you suspect, cause problems later on<P>
>im afraid if i do take him to the doctor the will want to recircumcise him <P>
If you get to know the subject it will help <BR>
I expect its a skinbridge - not a complicated condition,<BR>
    <A HREF="../../../skinbridges.html#start">http://www.male-initiation.net/skinbridges.html</A><BR>
otherwise (where is the foreskin stuck? -please read)<BR>
    <A HREF="../../../frenulum_breve.html#start">http://www.male-initiation.net/frenulum_breve.html 
    </A>
  <P>
both these conditions dont require circumcision - but you might well need to know your subject better to be able to talk with some doctors ...<P>
good luck<P>
Robin<BR>
actually you should go to the welcome page, the short summarries there might save a lot of reading<BR>

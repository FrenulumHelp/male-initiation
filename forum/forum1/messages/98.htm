I am now 67 and was born at a time when I believe that routine circumcision was very common.  I often wonder why I was not routinely circumcised shortly after birth.  Shortly after our son was born the Doctor asked my wife if she wished to have him circumcised.  No information was given to guide us in our decision and we decided against it.  Some years ago I considered having circumcision done with a private operation but the cost of the operation decided me against it.  I have recently have had tests for diabetes with negative results and there is no obvious medical reason for having it done but I have often wondered what the effects would have been on sexual intercourse if I had had the operation done.

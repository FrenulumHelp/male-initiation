Hi,<BR>
I recently had a frenuloplasy surgery. Everything looks fine except for the fact that it is not healing well. <BR>
The doctor did some stiches, but there are the following problems <P>
1) Since the area is under constant touch with the undergarments it does heal properly. <BR>
2) I am unable to apply any dressing because of the very elastic nature of the penis. <BR>
3) My foreskin does not remain retracted for very long, because of which the wound does not remain dry.<P>
It has been a week since I had the surgery. Please advice what would be the best way to handle this situation. Is there some kind of penis guard that is available that I can buy?
  <P> TIA<BR>

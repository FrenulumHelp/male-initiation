Raymond: I had the same situation when I was a teen (I'm almost 50 now).  I think it was the briefs that mother bought for me.  My penis would always 'fall down' and then I would get hard and I would be forced into a very uncomfortable situation, forcing a strong curve down between my legs.  In college I switched to boxers.  Now there is no forcing from erections.  It took awhile, but I no longer bend down when erect.  Maybe it's just because I'm 50, but I think it has to do with the briefs.  If you can't stand boxers, try to find some briefs that will point you upwards and keep you that way so that erections don't 'fold' your penis downward.<P>

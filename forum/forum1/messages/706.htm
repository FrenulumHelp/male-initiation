As an answer to: <A HREF="696.htm">to cut or not to cut, that is once again the question.</A> written by a really confused uncut guy. at 06 Oct 2000 11:30:43:<P>
I have bookmarked it though.<P>
I have been restoring my foreskin for almost two years and am part of the the largest FS restoration club on the internet.<P>
I am forunate to have had it both ways so I and many cyber friends can speak from some experience.  I have a lot of FS now (not completely covered yet) and enjoy it very much as does my wife.<P>
The sensation during intercourse is phonominal for both partners.  My wife feels a big difference in the lack of friction and the over all feeling of my penis.  Because of that lack of friction I last a lot longer which gives her the opportunity to reach her plateaus more often and more than once during intercourse.
  <P> Before you cut off the extra skin under stand that it does serve a purpose, 
    if it didn't we wouldn't be born with it.

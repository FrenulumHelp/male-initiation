As an answer to: <A HREF="178.htm">Re: Retracting Foreskin</A> written by R J Knight at 23 Dec 1999 01:23:59:<P>
Having had a near lifetime of existence with the foreskin retracted, I believe this is a worthwhile objective for those who can achieve it. The ease of cleanliness, disease rejection, and sexier appearance are worth trying to achieve for those not circumcised. This state as well as any properly performed circumcision are the best. <P>
There is not a loss of the sensitivity that conveys sexual pleasure. On contnued exposure the glans looses the ouch response but retains the ability to respond at least as well for orgasm. There actually can be some gain from the exposed corona becoming more prominent and less wimpy thus responding with better sensations. A century ago there were some MD's suggesting training the foreskin back, for thje cleanliness and disease rejection it affords.<P>
I've ready that among the Japanese it is expected that the mature male would wash up before the community baths, leaving the glans exposed, and this was considered mature and manly. In some parts of europe, those who can will wear the foreskin ineither position.<P>
It is my feeling that fir the uncircumcised this "skinning back" should become a rite of passage.  I also feel that for those having trouble attaining this, or having foreskin problems surgerey is entirely appropriate, but should not be limited to only the full circ procedure resulting in a tight "neat" circ. The intacters are not all wrong that a little hide can enhance the tickle. The fact stops there- foreskin = tickle. Orgasm best attained by deeper rubbing.<P>
I do wish there would be less traumatic thoughts and self doubt foisted on the circumcised by the intacters. This is unwarranted. The glans does well exposed to air- why hide it!

    >>>Since a lot of years I try to keep my foreskin back. We are very often 
    at a nudist beach in Europe an my wife wants me to pull the foreskin back. 
    That works only for two days. After this time my foreskin starts to swallow 
    and it slips over the glans. Does anybody knows if it is dangerous, to retract 
    the foreskin, what can happen. My wife an me enjay ist, but we don*t want 
    to circumzise. (sorry for the mistakes, I'm from germany)<BR>
    >>I must admit I wonder how common this situation is. My foreskin is naturally 
    retracted yet most <BR>
    >>information seems to assume that either you're cut, or if uncut, always

    >Nick, this situation is fairly common, or has been in the past in the USA. 
    I personally think you're to be envied since you have the advantages (such 
    as they are) of circumcision without having had to undergo surgery to get 
    them. When I was in the army I knew a guy whose foreskin stayed retracted, 
    and also in a movie theater line at Ft Campbell, KY, I once heard a guy tell 
    another one, "Mine looks circumcised but it's not, it just stays skinned-back 
    all the time!" A good many American men born before World War II kept their 
    foreskins retracted. Of course most men born in the US since WWII were circumcised 
    at birth, so haven't had the opportunity to practice retraction. This condition 
    has shown upon occasion in literature, of course. Moll Flanders, Fielding's 
    whore (or one of them) had a client whose penis was, as she put it, "half-capt." 
    In the Italian movie "1900", a 3-hour-long epic that came out about 20 years 
    ago, the kid who plays the protagonist as a boy goes into some high grass 
    with another boy <BR>
    >boy and tells him, "See, mine looks like yours now. I yanked it back!" Don't 
    know how common this was in Italy, but not very, I'd guess. Somewhere I saw 
    the statement that about half of all uncircumcised British males have the 
    glans at least halfway (and sometimes fully) exposed, apparently because the 
    foreskin through time tends to become permanently retracted as a result of 
    sexual activity. (I haven't peeked at the penises of British males--nor do 
    I want to!--& so can't agree or disagree with the truth of the statement.) 
    I have seen an article by a Michigan doctor writing in a medical journal in 
    1951 who stated that about 15% of all men living in the Saginaw area who had 
    been born in 1900 (thus were about 50 years old at that time) kept their foreskins 
    permanently retracted. Most of them had done this to themselves, he said, 
    either for purposes of health & cleanliness or because they preferred the 
    appearance of a penis with the foreskin retracted. The doctor coined the term 
    "autocircumcision" to describe the condition where the penis appears to be 
    circumcised but has no history of such surgery. I haven't seen the term in 
    print anywhere else, so it evidently didn't catch on. Anyway, at the time, 
    so many newborns were being circumcised that "autocircumcision" was doomed 
    to become a lot less common in the future in this country. Historically among 
    native Americans at least one branch of the Sioux nation, the Lakotah, kept 
    their foreskins retracted: their word for the adult penis, "sluka," (pronounced 
    sloo-KAH [?]) translates literally as "foreskin pushed back." Ruth Beebe Hill 
    lets us in on this bit of information in her 1979 novel, "Hanta Yo." There 
    would seem to be a perceived survival advantage in this practice for a tribe 
    whose men often needed to mount their horses in a hurry and ride off across 
    the plains: an infected penis would be a definite liability to a warrior trying 
    to keep up with his fellows. Whether the rest of the Sioux kept their foreskins 
    retracted I don't know. A linguist or anthropologist with access to a dictionary 
    of dialects of the tribe as a whole no doubt could determine this. The penis 
    like other parts of the human anatomy is pretty variable, as is the foreskin, 
    so it's not too surprising that some men have short foreskins (just as others 
    have quite long ones). If the anti-circumcisionists in time have their way 
    and persuade most Americans to give up their present devotion to circumcision 
    of the newborn, your retracted condition may assume more importance in the 
    future as more boys grow up with foreskins of their own to experiment with, 
    since most of this generation, at least, of American women express a preference 
    for the appearance of the circumcised penis, judging from their responses 
    to questionnaires. Who knows? Only a fool (or a sociologist, which I'm not) 
    would try to predict which way this vibrant nation will jump next. If you 
    collect any further information on this somewhat specialized subject, I'd 
    appreciate your sharing it. Cheers, Bob.

I just saw my doctor about this condition.  I've had it for about a year and decided to get it checked.  I did some research and found a prescription called "betamethasone .05%".  I asked my doctor about it and he said to give it a try.  In just 4 days I've noticed my foreskin is more elastic.  I've talked with other men and they said in from 1 to 2 months their foreskin was back to being fully elastic.  I'm 44 and I did not want to be circumcised.  I've been just fine with my foreskin all these years.

  <P> >> I have some serious concerns! I know there are a lot of foreskin comments 
    here, and I have a concern about my tight foreskin. Well at first it was very 
    tight, but over the years I have been stretching it out and I used a cream 
    for a while. Now I can pull it all the way back when limp, but when erect 
    I can only pull it back partially and it is painful. My concern is that somewhere 
    i read that there are thousands of very sensitive nerve endings on the foreskin 
    which <BR>
    >>enhance sex (making it much better for the uncircumcised man versus the 
    circumcised). I am worried that by continually stretching it when it hurts 
    I might damage these nerve endings (there are little tiny white spots (not 
    smegma)that look like they might be nerve endings) and decrease my future 
    sexual pleasure.<BR>
    >> This is related to my other concerns. I am 19 year old virgin, itching 
    to have sex. A few months ago I got involved with a girl who offered me sex 
    on 4 occassions, but alas, I could not get an erection! Granted, 3 of these 
    times i was either drunk or stoned, but the 4th time i was totally sober and 
    I still couldn't get an erection, even after looking at porno! I wanted to 
    crawl in a hole and die, cuz i'm 19 and couldn't get it up. But I talked to 
    a doctor who said that since i regularly masturbate there can be nothing wrong 
    with my penis, and I am not gay. Could it just be nervousness about losing 
    my virginity???? <BR>
    >> Anyways, I thought maybe it was related to my foreskin, because the fact 
    that I can't pull it back all the way means that maybe i can't get an erection 
    without lots of direct pressure (i.e. masturbation) because the sensitive 
    glans is covered. I mean, can I even have sex or get a decent blowjob when 
    I can't pull my foreskin all the way back??? Last time I tried to pull it 
    back for a blowjob, the blowjob hurt like hell!!! Will sex hurt? Should I 
    keep forcing the skin back? will I damage nerves???? <BR>
    >> I need advice urgently because in a week this girl is coming to visit me 
    and going to give me another opportunity to have sex. If I fail to get an 
    erection this time i will need to crawl in a hole and die. What should I do??? 
    I am so worried. If u reply, any medical studies or medical sites which can 
    back up what u say would be greatly appreciated. Thank u my fellow men!<BR>

    >I'm 19 too and not circd. I had phimosis but I used betamethasone .05% cream 
    to cure it. I started having sex while I still had phimosis. Just keep your 
    head calm and you'll be fine. <BR>
    >Ask your doctor for a prescription for the cream. Heres the study I found 
    about it: http://www.cirp.org/library/treatment/phimosis/wright/<BR>
    >Print it out and show him. He'll give you a script then.<BR>
    >Apply it once per day to the outside of your foreskin from the opening tip 
    to about mid glans (mid head). YOu'll see results within the first week but 
    it may take as long as 6-8 weeks. Its well worth it though. Sex feels a lot 
    better when your skin goes back and slides up and down the head.<BR>

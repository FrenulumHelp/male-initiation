<INPUT type=hidden NAME="body" VALUE="&gt;&gt;    Dear friends... I am a man who is 32 years old, I am spanish and I have
&gt;a
&gt;&gt; very tigh foreskin.
&gt;&gt;    I have phimosis, here the doctors says that solution is cut it but I
&gt;&gt; don´t want it and I am very afraid.
&gt;&gt;    By one side, I can retract the foreskin over the heat when my penis is
&gt;&gt; solf, but I can´t touch the hear or gland, it hurts and pains a lot, I
&gt;think
&gt;&gt; it must be about the sensitive but I am not sure. and I have thought that
&gt;if
&gt;&gt; I cut the foreskin (not me of course) and the gland is in touch with the
&gt;&gt; underwear and everything that touch it, must be very painful, even when
&gt;you
&gt;&gt; are walking...
&gt;&gt;    Is is any method to make the gland less sensitive? is it possible to
&gt;&gt; treat the phimosis just making a little slide in a dorsal side of the
&gt;penis
&gt;&gt; just to liberated the tension between it and the gland when you are
&gt;&gt; erect?...
&gt;&gt;    I am very worry about it and at my age, it is impossible and difficult
&gt;to
&gt;&gt; talk to this term with my doctor,,, embarazing with me... you know what I
&gt;&gt; mean?
&gt;&gt;    I have never had any sexual experience with a woman ´cause I am gay and
&gt;&gt; in that kind of sex experience I am botton ´cause to try to penetrate
&gt;cause
&gt;&gt; me very painful...
&gt;&gt;    Can you help me?
&gt;&gt;    Please,
&gt;&gt;    I will be waiting to hear from you soon
&gt;&gt;    Best regards

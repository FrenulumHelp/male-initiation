I recently had a circumcision for phimosis, after a rough and long healing process, it appears that the doctor took too much foreskin.....the result is that have a hard time getting a full erection.  The skin is so tight that it pulls on the skin at the base of my penis resulting in what appears to be a taper or almost cone-shape to my penis.  Has anyone ever heard of this?  Iv'e actually talked with a plastic surgeon about adding skin to my penis....any ideas?

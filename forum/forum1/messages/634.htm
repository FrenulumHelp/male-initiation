As an answer to: <A HREF="434.htm">Triamcinolone</A> written by Ned at 29 May 2000 10:58:35:
  <P> >Another possibility, perhaps, is triamcinolone cream (another corticosteroid 
    agent), but again you would need to consult your GP.<BR>
    >>Try betamethasone instead. Both hydrocortisone and betamethasone are corticosteroid 
    drugs (so you will probably need to get a prescription from your doctor for 
    either of them) but beta is the more usual application for phimosis. Incidentally, 
    it may also be used as a treatment for eczema, psoriasis, allergic rhinitis 
    (hay fever) and arthritis!<BR>
    >>Beta should only be used sparingly, as it can cause thinning of the skin 
    and may also aggravate pre-existing skin infections.<BR>
    >>Swallow your pride, and make an appointment to see your doctor to chat things 
    over with him/her.<BR>
    >>=====<BR>
    >>>I read a while back that Hydrocortsion cream can help to aid a tight foreskin 
    because of its skin thinning effect. Has anyone tried of heard of this before?

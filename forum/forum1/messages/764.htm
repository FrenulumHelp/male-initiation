What you need to do is go to a doctor ASAP and have him/her diagnose your problem and advise you, with some knowledge of what is practical to be done.  There's no point whatever in letting your embarrasment keep you from getting the help you need.  Most doctors will already have seen a penis, and you are not likely to have something totally new to show them.  Also, the condition of your penis is not your fault (you obviously didn't choose to have it this way!), so there is no reason whatever for you to be ashamed to show it to the doctor, and move on from there.  After all, treating this kind of thing is their job.  Now go on, get moving!  Best wishes, RJK.

Hi Dave.<P>
Guess only a consultant could tell you that one.  I was circ'd 10 years ago on the NHS, but was shocked when my surgeon told me I could have it in 5 weeks.  I was hoping for more time to adjust to the idea, and expected huge waiting lists.<P>
If you can get past the GP, then you should get more help.<P>
Good Luck,<P>
Dave.

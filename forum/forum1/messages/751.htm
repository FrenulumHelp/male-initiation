>for anyone who has been cut - do you regret it?  at all?<BR>
>>help! i thought i knew what i wanted to do about my phimosis and had decided not to get a circumcision.  but now i have done more research in the pro-circumcision side of things and i don't know!  i am really lost now, and i thought i knew.  i am now tempted to get a circ. but but arrrrrrrrrrrggggh HELP! where could i find UNbiased info on this i.e. somewhere that is not pro one or the other?  please could someone help me out i am going mental!!!!!!!!!!<P>
Yes after the operation my wife became sexually displeased and we have since seperated. It was the stupidest choice I have ever made. <BR>
The idea that a circimcised penis is '100% clean' is really dumb, no part of our bodies are completly clean it is impossiable. It is more of a mind set than a medical question. Question: Would you cut your ear lobe off because it collects wax? or rip your finger nails out because dirt collects undeer them?  <BR>
I will never be the same again Take my advise <BR>
PLEASE *DONT* MAKE THE MISTAKE I DID!

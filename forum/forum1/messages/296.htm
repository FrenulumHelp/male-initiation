It sounds like a phimotic ring, but you would have to see a doctor to be certain.<BR>
A topical steroid cream may resolve the problem, but it can't be purchased<BR>
without a prescription.<BR>
Not all doctors know about the treatment of phimosis with Kenalog and Betamethasone, so I suggest you take some literature off the web with you.<BR>

  <P> >i'm 29 and not able to retract back my foreskin. My outer foreskin is very 
    flexible and have no problem at all masterbating. But on the inner side of 
    my foreskin the opening is very small 1/4 inch which just exposes the tip 
    of my gland. Is this a phimosis ring?? And can it be cured using steroid?? 
    Can i get the steroid creame without subscription from a drug store. Thanks 
    in advance.

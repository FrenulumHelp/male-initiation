As an answer to: <A HREF="551.htm">I like my tight foreskin, but will it all go wrong?</A> written by Aldo at 03 Aug 2000 04:25:10:
  <P> It's fairly normal in uncircumcised men for the foreskin to stretch through 
    normal sexualy activity, in time. I saw something somewhere that said about 
    half the adult male British population has the glans at least half exposed 
    as a result of normal sexual activity. Viewed from another angle, I'd be apprehensive 
    about the possibility of cancer eveentually showing up because of prolonged 
    failure to clean the penis. Of course, it may be that your penis has retained 
    the natural infantile condition in which the inner foreskin (mucosa) is firmly 
    fused to the surface of the glans. If this is the case, there may be no problem 
    of dirt accumulating beneath the foreskin because there is no cavity between 
    foreskin and glans. It would probably be a good idea to have a physician check 
    your penis and find whether in fact there is a fusion of internal foreskin 
    and glans. This he/she could do by GENTLY trying to pass a probe between foreskin 
    and glans. If a fusion is actually found to exist, you may be urged to have 
    a circumcision, but you don't of course have to agree to this or any other 
    procedure. You may be needlessly apprehensive; if the foreskin did loosen 
    up & you were able to use your bare glans in sexual activity (and also to 
    clean the penis regularly with soap & water), you might find that you enjoy 
    having things that way! Cheers, RJK. <BR>
    >Hi.<BR>
    >I am 19 and have never seen my foreskin retracted. I have a very tight foreskin 
    wich cannot be retracted at all even when not erect. This however has not 
    stopped me having sex, infact Because I am less sensitive I can outlast most 
    of the girls I'm Fucking. because of this and other reasons I do not not wish 
    for my foreskin to be made 'normal'. My only fear is that my tight foreskin 
    will through sex eventually stretch to a point where it can be only partially 
    retracted, thus risking pain. I have read about men who have learned to live 
    and do infact prefer their non-retractable foreskins. I would like too talk 
    with these men, as I live in a country which can only be described as living 
    ion the medical dark ages. Thanks for any help.<BR>

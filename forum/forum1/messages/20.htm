>hello, I recieved a dorsal slit as a child. I believe it was an obliqe dorsal slit. It was done without my permission and I want it reversed. I have finally gotten the nerve to consult a couple of doctors and have been met with total disregard for my feelings. they cannot comprehend why I would want to do this. I want to have the original scar re-opened and put back to its original position and stitched. Does anyone out there have a dorsal slit- has anyone tried to have it repaired- how did you find a doctor that isnt arrogant as hell- does anyone have before and after pictures? I havent been able to get any information about this in 5 or 6 years. am I totally alone on this????? If you can help me I would greatly appreciate it. Thank You Very Much! Steve
  <P> Steve, I wouldn't get too upset that somebody else gave you a d.s. without 
    your permission. I got diphtheria and other shots, dentistry & x-rays (among 
    other procedures) as a kid without giving my permission, but never thought 
    too much about it. A definite possibility is that you may have had a phimosis 
    or some other problem that needed help and your parents opted for d.s. as 
    less traumatic that circumcision, which it definitely was. The fact that you 
    didn't get a "routine circ" suggests the possibility of something like this. 
    You ask if anyone out here has a dorsal slit & has tried to get it repaired: 
    well, I had one for years and then traded it in for a circumcision, which 
    I have never regretted. The d.s. didn't bother me, was easy to keep clean, 
    and there was no great need for circumcision on my part, I just felt it would 
    be neater & easier to keep clean, which it is -- no smegma ever, & no dirt 
    collecting because there's not much skin for it to collect under. An interesting 
    sidelight: lady friends have commented favorably on the appearance of my circumcised 
    penis, and a urologist (who didn't do the circ) referred to it as a "super 
    job." So if the appearance of your dorsal slit is one of the things that bothers 
    you, you might seriously consider circumcision by a competent surgeon. (Ironically, 
    you probably won't have a problem finding a doctor to take your request for 
    this procedure seriously.) Oh yes, sex feels great with my circumcised penis, 
    not to speak for anyone else. The doctors you've consulted probably tend to 
    disregard your feelings because their bias is toward improved hygiene, not 
    aesthetics, and they consider that you've had a minimal invasion of your anatomy. 
    One point to consider if aesthetics are involved in your scheme is the likelihood 
    that if you could find a doctor in sympathy with you (& you might in France, 
    Denmark or California), the slit could be stitched up so the foreskin would 
    more or less surround the glans, but I believe it would be quite impossible 
    to stitch it in such a way that there would not be a prominent scar running 
    the length of the original slit. A question: have you shared your thoughts 
    with any friends close to home? Do they agree with you in down-grading your 
    dorsally-slit penis? I've known a good many boys & men with d.s. in my time, 
    & none of them had a problem (physically or emotionally) with their condition. 
    Some soldiers in combat who could not wash properly had themselves given a 
    dorsal slit in preference to a circumcision, and seemed to be totallly happy 
    with the result (maybe because they'd kept their foreskins!). Something that's 
    important to you, namely what you consider to be the intervention into your 
    bodily integrity, is probably considered to be trivial by the arrogant physicians 
    you've encountered, and I think that's too bad; you deserve the consideration 
    of being taken seriously, because if it's serious to you, it is in fact serious. 
    Have you discussed the matter with either of your parents to get an idea of 
    what they were thinking when they had the d.s. done? This won't restore your 
    penis to an uncut condition, but it may give you some insights that haven't 
    occurred to you. (If you've seen Rosalind's letter in this same forum, you 
    can see that parents are sometimes confronted with unpleasant problems that 
    demand treatment of one kind or another.) What I've laid out here may not 
    be much comfort or help to you. I know some men who'd be happy to have nothing 
    more serious than what confronts you, but again that may be small comfort 
    to you. A thought that occurs to me in this wandering monologue is that you 
    might get more satisfactory treatment from the medical profession if you'd 
    go to a plastic surgeon & ask him (or her???!)for a recommendation. Any treatment 
    you got would probably be expensive, but if the doctor gave you the courtesy 
    of a serious view of your problem and an approach to achieving a better-looking 
    penis, with more eye appeal to sexual partners, this might be of real help 
    to you. Good luck, & best wishes. Bob. </BLOCKQUOTE>

Hello Gerard,<P>
As it says at the top of the main page - Please write any new questions on Forum2<P>
this sounds like secondary phimosis due to LSA - recent research suggests new cures for LSA which I`ll post soon on forum 2 <BR>

  <P> >Hello,<BR>
    >I'm wondering about wether I have got phimisos or another problem.<BR>
    >About a year ago my foreskin became a lot tighter, before it was no problem 
    to get it back over the head when erect. But at that time it became more and 
    more difficult to do that. A couple of months before I spotted a lightish 
    spot on the gland, about 2-3mm wide. The docter had a look and we had some 
    tests done (a smear taken and sent to the hospital-lab), nothing to be found. 
    The spot went more or less away, but as mentioned my foreskin became tighter. 
    It became impossible to retract it when erect.<BR>
    >At the moment it feels like the very 'front'-edge of the skin has gone hard 
    and unstrechable, it looks quite white. The rest seems to be unaffected. I 
    can retract the skin when cleaning, but only with some difficulty (not a lot 
    of pain), the unstreched opening is about 10mm in diameter. I can 'pull' the 
    gland from underneath while stretching the skin back to clean. Pulling it 
    back is not too difficult.<BR>
    >My question: what could this be, phimosis or a skin infection, or other and 
    secondly of course what to do about it?<BR>
    >Thanks for any reply's<BR>

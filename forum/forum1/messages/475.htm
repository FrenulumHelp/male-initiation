>>>>>Hey im 17 years old and I have Frenulum Breve. The pain is unbare-able when masterbating... Well its not that bad but it hurts! Anyways, I know im going to have sex soon but I do not want my Frenulum to rip. I have been on many sites and I found one that quotes a man that has gotten incision of the Frenulum done. He described the pain as the worst he has ever had, that it felt like he was hit with electricty because of the senstivity and felt like he was dead.... now this sounds like it sucks and I do want it done, but does it really hurt so much? How long is the *Procedure* ?And also how long does it take to heal completely? Thank you very much.<BR>

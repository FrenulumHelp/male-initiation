  <P> You don't have to get a circumcision. But you may have to be firm with the 
    doctor. If he insists that only a circumcision will work for you -- go find 
    another doctor. You don't have to do what the doctor says. Even insurance 
    companies ask for second opinions! You are entitled to a second or a third 
    or more if you don't like the options that the first doctor gives you.</BLOCKQUOTE>

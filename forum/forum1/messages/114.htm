I understand 3 years old is young! BUT I want to be aware and informed.My family GP has stated that my son has Phimosis. From what I have read I understand that this may not be, because he is still so young.  His foreskin has never retracted, his stream is good,  (according to my husband) my son never complains of pain or discomfort. When he was born the Doctor wanted to circumsize him, I asked the Doctor if there was something medically wrong with his penis (We are from the U.K. this proceedure is not performed as readily in the UK as it appears to be in North America)The Doctor advised NO but possibly later! I am now worried we made the wrong choice. I have recently read that streching can help -I know nothing about how to do this can anyone advise, or pass on any information that may be of help?  <BR>
Thank you!<BR>

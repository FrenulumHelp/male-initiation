>>I've had problems with my frenulum for as long as I can remember!  ... it is restricted by my frenulum and is a bit of a bugger to get right back while erect - although possible - its a bit tight! <P>
Craig needs a frenoplasty (frenuloplasty) - crazy that you have to wait till May for an appointment to get an op. that ideally takes 5 mins. and should have been done before puberty ---<P>
WB: >Well my frenulum adhered... and as a teenager this became very painful during erections... <P>
luckily with frenoplasty the docs usually bandage the foreskin back so theres no chance of skinbridges. (and actually there`s not much soreness from frenoplasty - its circ. which usually leaves you sore)<P>
>man it's not bad... and it surely releases your penis to function properly... Good luck.... I know you'll be fine.... It sure helped me<P>
It sure does,-  if only the op. is done properly, and it is amazing how often the modren doctor can bodge a circ.- the oldest op. of all - there`s probably less danger by heart by-pass ! AND what annoys me is that the Institute for Sexual Research in Hamburg are convinced that after an op. there is no change in the sexual disturbances - (and I have tapes to prove this) - 
  <P> Thanks for your contributions maybe we can help get kids in future a better 
    start than we had <BR>

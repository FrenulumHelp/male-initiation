We were prescribed Kenalog cream for our son a couple of years ago. It is similar to the betamethasone so I imagine the price would be comparable.<BR>
I don't remember the exact cost, but I do remember that it was quite reasonable.<BR>
In my son's case the results haven't lasted, but that is because he was only about 7 when we used the cream and we could not get him to continue to retract his foreskin regularly to keep it loose.<BR>
I believe Nick (Yes, Nick. I'm throwing your name all over the place again) used the cream over a year ago and he has had no recurrence.<BR>

>I'm so happy to hear that you don't need to be circ'd but i'm wondering how much does the cream cost - and do the results last ?

As an answer to: <A HREF="831.htm">Re: Solution to Stinky Penis</A> written by R J Knight at 15 Dec 2000 18:22:52:<P>
I never really knew my hood was so long, because everyone in my family has been blessed with long, rubbery foreskin.  I prefer the odor to circumcision...and as a matter of fact, rather enjoy my musky scent.  I'm also not sure I'm all that interested in a dorsal slit either.  Did you have this same problem before you were cut?  How much foreskin did you have?
  <P> >I think the guys who suggest permanent retraction have a good idea, if 
    you don't want to go for circumcision. Retraction is less traumatic and kicks 
    in right away; you don't have to go through a long healing process & have 
    a month or so when you're out of action. I knew several guys in the service 
    who kept their foreskins retracted & they seemed to have no problems, & to 
    be totally satisfied with their condition. On the other hand, if you have 
    a 1.5 inch overhang when erect, you are more blessed with foreskin than the 
    average man, & it sounds as if it can be a real problem to keep clean. Circumcision, 
    after it healed, would probably be a great relief to you (unlike the average 
    uncut guy who can settle quite nicely with retraction), but if you don't want 
    to go through with it you might try a dorsal slit that exposes enough of the 
    glans to permit air to reach it & keep it dry so bacteria don't grow on it 
    to cause odors & irritation. (I have a theory that circumcision was invented 
    originally not out of human perversity but to solve a real problem that confronts 
    men with foreskins like yours, but of course you represent a small segment 
    of the total population. And dorsal slit may not be necessary for you -- you 
    may want to try retraction first to see whether it can help you. It may be 
    hard to get a full retraction with such a large amount of foreskin, but you 
    may be able to dry things out enough with a partial exposure, achieved by 
    rolling the foreskin inward on itself & keeping about half the glans bare, 
    so that urine is not trapped under it to promote bacterial growth. You may 
    want to take things slow & easy to see if you can't remedy the problem without 
    resorting to surgery. To repeat a cliche, all penises (& penile problems) 
    are not alike, so there's no one solution that can cover every problem. If 
    you try several approaches & nothing works, you can always go to a urologist 
    & talk about d.s. or even circumcision, which many men (including myself!) 
    have found a comfortable way to go. Hope you can work things out well with 
    minimal trauma. RJK.<BR>
    >>>>>Why is it that no matter how much time and effort I put into washing 
    my penis in the shower,(keeping the foreskin pulled back) I still get that 
    awful whiff of a rancid smell whenever I pull my foreskin back throughout 
    the day, or even right after a shower. This problem isn't great for my love 
    life. Have any of you fellow uncut guys found a way to really keep yourselves 
    clean and smelling good without having to resort to circumcision?<BR>
    >>>>* * *<BR>
    >>>>Yes! Here is THE solution, and I can personally say that it works. Permanent 
    foreskin retraction achieves ALL of the benefits of circumcision with NONE 
    of the other effects. Depending upon how tight or loose your foreskin is and 
    how sensitive the head, you may find this to be easy or difficult. Mine was 
    loose and would not stay, and took considerable effort on my part until penis 
    growth, especially the size of the head, kept it back more often and finally 
    all the time. Fortunately I hadn't finished puberty and growth yet. In adults, 
    Im sure it would be more difficult. Take a look at circlist.org/cfeelcut.html 
    for help. Bacteria that breed in the swamp under the unretracted foreskin 
    multiply so quickly that it becomes a full time job keeping it clean if you 
    don't get the penis out in the open so it can breathe and dry out. I did read 
    a comment from one guy about using baby powder under there, but that can interfere 
    with some kinds of sex and would still require constant application for the 
    rest of your life. Go for the retraction. It is harmless, painless, costless 
    and reversable, as another guy like me likes to say. At the very worst, it 
    only makes circumcision easier if that becomes your last resort. At best, 
    you will be forever clean and ready for any impromptu encounter, and may even 
    come to prefer the look and feel. I do.<BR>
    >>>I totally agree with the above remarks. Permanent retraction does the job, 
    with no disadvantages such as removal of the foreskin, which some people prize 
    highly. (It does have a lot of nerve endings that must contribute to sexual 
    pleasure, although some folks debate this.) Retraction has a long history. 
    Millions of American men born before circumcision became common here after 
    1945 kept their foreskins retracted, according to some published reports in 
    medical journals of the early 1950s.<BR>
    >>>The best results come from total retraction, as the letter above points 
    out,<BR>
    >>>but if you have a long, loose foreskin that won't cooperate, you can definitely 
    train it to stay rolled up behind the glans so it keeps the glans bare and 
    dry at all times. It may not want to stay rolled up at first, but you can 
    keep it in the position you want with adhesive tape; after a couple of days 
    it should stay neatly rolled up behind the bare glans. This makes for a much 
    cleaner penis than one with a long foreskin, but of course you still have 
    to clean under the rolled-up skin every time you shower. Because you have 
    had a lot of trouble with bacteria, you may still have some problems under 
    the rolled-up skin, although most guys who've done this don't seem to, possibly 
    because no urine passes under the roll of skin to keep that area wet & friendly 
    to bacteria. If neither of these approaches work you can always try circumcision 
    or dorsal slit, & either of these should dry out the bacteria and stop the 
    stink, but because of the ease and minimal trauma of retraction, you may want 
    to try it before anything else. Good luck! RJK.<BR>

    >>Any suggestions, my foreskins hangs over about 1.5" when I'm erect...it's 
    very loose (from stretching it when I was going through puberty), and no matter 
    how often I wash, I always seem to have that musky odor. It is especially 
    bad after I've had sex with my girlfriend (I don't use a condom...it never 
    stays on...too much foreskin). I do try to keep myself clean, when ever I 
    shower, I always take great care to skin myself back and forth and use lots 
    of soap. I always end up getting erect too.

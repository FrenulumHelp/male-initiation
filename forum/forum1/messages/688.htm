After seeing my GP I had to wait nearly 3 months to get an appointment with the urologist (obviously they didn't think it was urgent!), but after that I only had to wait 3 weeks before the operation.  This was because they did it as day surgery (i.e. spent only a couple of hours in hospital).  If for some reason you have to be admitted for over a day I was told the waiting list would mean about an 18 month wait.

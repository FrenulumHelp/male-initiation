You didn't say if you are circumcised or not? I know that some of us who still have our foreskins have a very large vien in the foreskin on the upper side of the glans. I know mine gets rather large during erection and is quite firm. as it is retracted- it then is behind the glans on top. When I was younger, it would stay erect much longer after an ejaculation and sometimes took twice to go down- it may just be that you are keeping an erection quite a while after you finish.<BR>

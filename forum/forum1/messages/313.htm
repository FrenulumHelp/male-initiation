Hi Robin (and anyone else who is listening :)<P>
Thanks for your compliments, they made me feel nice, but I'm afraid I don't deserve them.<P>
It seems we both had too much fun with "research" to really *look* before - but now we have, I can give real specifics.<P>
His foreskin reteacts easily and naturally until it is totally off the front and sides of his glans, but the back (closest to body, furthest from frenulum) stops about 5mm from the edge (does the edge of the glans have a name? Not the join, but the widest part, at the base of it.)<P>
His glans is very much wider than his shaft, almost 1cm wider, and until the movement actually stops, there is no problem.<P>
Until last time (and we only see each other weekly) I had not realised that I was not fully uncovering his glans, probably because of its size... This time, however I did gently and slowly retract it past the widest part, which was slightly uncomfy, but not actually painful - although he did say that oral sex on the fully exposed glans "prickled" and asked me to stop. I assume this is a sensativity problem due to under exposure of the part though.<P>
Once his foreskin is totally retracted, there is a sort of jerk as it slips in behind the glans...almost a paraphimosis, although it does not get "stuck" as such, or cause the glans to swell.<P>
What *does* happen is that there is no movement of the foreskin whatsoever during any sort of thrusting, once it has passed this bumping into position stage. There is no evidence of a tight ring or band of skin, just... not enough actual flesh to go right around the widest point. Will stretching excercises and cortisone creams help with this, or only with phimotic rings?<P>
It is a simple matter to urge the forekin back over the crest of his glans, and in fact this happens naturally once his errection starts to go down.<P>
I'm pretty certain that it is the moveing back over the bump into a fully retracted position that gives him pain, and not just a small part of his glans being over sensative due to lack of previous stimulation, as only first entry hurts, and once that is acomplished he can get out and change positions without trouble.<P>
I'm sorry for being so long winded, but I couldn't really explain clearly enough with fewer words. I'll also be posting most this letter on the ARClist, because the more ideas I get, the more pleased I will be.<P>
So - to reiterate: will cortisone creams and stretching help with a foreskin wich is not affected by a phimotic ring, but just naturally too small? And has any one any other sugestions?<P>
Thanks, <BR>
Trina

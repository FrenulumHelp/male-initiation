The frenulum is already situated pretty low on the head, but it's so short that it causes real problems. Is there any possibility to snip the frenulum and stich it even further down to get an entirely free head? Do I really have to keep frenulum?
  <P> Thanks a lot!<BR>
    I will see a doctor next week, I am going to get this done. I just want to 
    increase my knowlegde of my situation and possibilities beforehand.<BR>

There is no non-surgical way to increase penis size, and there are many risks with surgery. Also, smoking has nothing to do with it (though there are other good reasons to give up smoking). But why worry ?? Five inches is well within the normal range.<P>
For a good discussion of penis size, try:<P>

The pleasure you give (to yourself and your partners) has little to with size. So enjoy :-)<P>

>I am 18 years old. My erect penile size is close to 5 inches. I'm kina depressed here. Is there any non-surgical way to induce growth? Also how much (if at all) can I expect it to grow? Last question: Does smoking affect size and growth of the penis, wil it help to quit now? I appreciate all info I can get. Thanks

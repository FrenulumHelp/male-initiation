No.  Not for one moment have I regretted being circumcised. <P>
I may regret or have a sadness sometimes that I had phimosis at all, because it affected my whole life, but I am happy that I did it, at my request, for me.<BR>
Sex is great, but then I ever had sex with phimosis or with a working foreskin, but 10 years on I am still wonderfully sensitive. <P>
From the men in this group there are different ways of curing, and variants of circumcison, so consider carefully - writing down on paper is always a good way, the pros and cons of each cure.<P>
It is always a very personal decision.  It may be reached quickly or at length, but sometimes all the information in the world can't make that decision for you.<BR>
It will come down to what you want and why you want it.  Good luck.<P>

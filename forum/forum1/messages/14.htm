Dean,<BR>
hello Robin here again, your private e.mail address does not work through my server (???)<P>
I felt concerned about your situation and have been wondering if we can get you operated and healed in a month ... with a simple dorsal slit ...<P>
Also where abouts do you live in England, I have a fair amount of contacts in the UK and could maybe find you someone to talk with
  <P> Robin

  <P>
[I DO NOT WANT TO BE CIRCUMCISED] please tell me there is something I can do<BR>
>>I am very worried and I am scared.  When I was younger I never retracted my foreskin like I was supposed to and now I wish I could go back in time and fix that...Anyhoo please tell me there is something that can be done other than circumcision.  I'd kill myself if I had to be circumcised!<P>
ONE RUDE ANSWER: <BR>
>Haahahaha that'll teach ya.<P>
MY ANSWER:  Well, it -is- your fault because you knew what you were supposed to do.  One guy had an interesting thought, that you have the right at 14 to refuse any treatment you don't want.  I wouldn't be so sure.  Many boys -want- circucmcision at your age and cannot get it without parental or guardian approval.  But since you don't, there is only one other solution.  You -MUST- get the phimosis fixed.  Then you must learn to keep it retracted if you don't want to lose it.  See this:

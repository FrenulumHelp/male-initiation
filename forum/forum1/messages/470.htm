Hi Wrae<P>
I can 100% confirm that BXO is NOT a STD!  Although it hurts me to say it, I have not had intercourse or any sexual activity with my genitals (except for masturbation) in 17 years and I have just recently undergone surgery (in last 6 weeks) for such a diagnosis (see my posting dated 6/19/2000).
  <P> >>I run the only support group in the UK (and possibly in the world) for 
    lichen sclerosus (BXO in men, although the medical profession are now calling 
    BXO in men lichen sclerosus now). My information on LS is predominantly female 
    and I feel that I should have information available which would help men with 
    this condition. Is there anyone who could contribute towards this information 
    - from the point of view of being a sufferer what would be helpful to you 
    to know about?<BR>
    > My name is Wrae and about 15 years ago I had symptoms of BXO although I 
    was never diagnosed, I found complete remission by soaking my penis in standard 
    strength Hydrogen Peroxide for 5-15 minutes two or three times per day for 
    several weeks. The condition has not re-occurred. I am not a doctor but do 
    have an opinion about BXO...I think it to be a STD cosnsisting of some sort 
    of microbe of a viral, bacterial, fungal or similar origin and pathology and 
    the Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2) has a strong Oxidation Effect. I have also found 
    H2O2 to be a quick healer of most any external infection.<BR>
    >Thanks for your concern!<BR>

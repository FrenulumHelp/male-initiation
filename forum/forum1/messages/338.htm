As an answer to: <A HREF="337.htm">Frenuloplasty</A> written by callum Elliot at 30 Mar 2000 18:43:49:<P>
If the physician doing the job (I hesitate to say "op"!) is experienced and competent, the entire episode should be a total non-event.  Unless the frenulum itself (or parts of it) is removed, you are highly unlikely to lose any sensation.  I suppose it's natural to feel some apprehension before any experience of this kind,  but staying calm, cool and collected woould seem to be entirely in order.  Good luck!  Cheers, Bob.

    >I'm due for a Frenuloplasty soon and I'm v.anxious. I'm 35 and I've enjoyed 
    a pain free sex life uptill now. Recently my frenulun ripped and the urolgist 
    recommended the above. I accepted as now I experience pain.<BR>
    >I'm afraid that I will lose sensation, will be unpleasantly scarres and that 
    if the op is a flop may have to face the terror of a circ (not an option)!<BR>

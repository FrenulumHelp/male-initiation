  <P> Hey Guys! I have been holding off writing until I waas sure soemthing I 
    tried worked. About 5 weeks ago, after a couple years of my foreskin getting 
    tighter to the point I had trouble getting it past tthe gland for cleaning. 
    Well i experienced a tear, ouch!. Now how do I heal this. "Neosporin Plus" 
    I know it healing power and I used it. The tear healed in (2) days Wow! Guess 
    what I waas experiencing something else, I could get the foreskin back pass 
    the Gland with some ease. Now after 5 weeks I don't think about the Tight 
    foreskin I had before. Of course it is not like I was when I was 20, now I'm 
    55, but let me tell you it worked. I clean myself and dry after urinating 
    then apply the Neosporin Plus, that's all there is to it. No more tears or 
    trouble cleaning the Gland. </BLOCKQUOTE>

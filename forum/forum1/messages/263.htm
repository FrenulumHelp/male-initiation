It looks like I can get a lot of help here - finally I can find someone to relate to..<BR>
Here's my problem - I've never been able to fully retract my foreskin; The best<BR>
I can do is stretch it to the point that the meatus - the slit part - is showing. I've read about the creams but do they only work for "acquired phimosis" ? - i've had this problem all my life and I'm 20 now.<P>
I also have a question for those people that don't have a problem with their phimosis and aren't planning on doing anything about it.  When I urinate, some urine is left under the foreskin and I have to do quite a bit of work to totally get rid of it which is sometimes not possible especially when I'm outside of the house .. this leaves small, but embarassing stains on my underpants - does anyone else have this problem ?

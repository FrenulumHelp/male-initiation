  <P> Hi, I have an uncircumcised penis and I retracted my foreskin when I was 
    11 to clean it out. From then on, whenever my foreskin would cover my glans, 
    I would pull it back because I thought my foreskin would go back around my 
    glans and therefore be painful to retract. I'm 15 now and sometimes my foreskin 
    appears very loose and wrinkly when flaccid but other times it is tight when 
    my penis is flaccid. When I am starting to have an erection sometimes, my 
    penis wrinkles a little bit. After I urinate, I always make sure to pull my 
    foreskin over the glans. I was wondering if it is normal to have a wrinkly 
    appearance sometimes when my penis is flaccid. Do uncircumcised penises just 
    naturally look wrinkled sometimes? Are there any other ways to make my penis 
    look smoother or to make my foreskin always cover my glans when flaccid? Thanks.

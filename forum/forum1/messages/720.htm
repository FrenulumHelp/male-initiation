As an answer to: <A HREF="719.htm">Re: my foreskin is attached on the underside of my penis, pooblem? Bobby dmy</A> written by R J Knight at 13 Oct 2000 02:18:00:<P>
Q:  On the under side of my penis, my foreskin is attached to the actuall penis, but I can pull my foreskin fully back, should I worry?
  <P> A: The connection is called the frenum. Normally, when the foreskin is retracted 
    tightly, and is often kept that way if circumcised, that string of skin on 
    the bottom, the frenum, pulls the slit downward near or at the bottom of the 
    tip of the glans which causes the top ridge of the glans to flare out for 
    increased sexual stimulation during intercourse. In South America, it is supposedly 
    popular to cut the frenum rather than to circumcise the foreskin, and this 
    makes it easy to keep the foreskin held in either position forward or back.

Don't be scared of going to the doctor - he's seen it all before!<P>
I have just had a partial dorsal slit and frenuloplasty to cure the same problem.  The Urologist was fairly pushy about having a full circumcision but I am 27 and did not like the idea at all.<P>
I have only ever been able to have sex with a condom before as without caused the foreskin to go back making ejaculation impossible.  As I've just got married and will be trying for kids I've had to have this operation.  It was only five days ago and is quite sore but I'm hoping I'll be a lot happier with it than with full circumcision.<P>
Just don't be embarrassed to tell the doctor what you want.

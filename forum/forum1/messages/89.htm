It is difficult to determine -- but I think a lot of men have tight foreskins- being a "stretcher"- I would recommend you try careful stretching by retracting as far as it will comfortably go while erect- I think a lot can be gained  by not trying to go too far at any one time. You could possibly have frenulum breve but you didn't mention if it pulls the glans downward when retracted when flaccid. good luck

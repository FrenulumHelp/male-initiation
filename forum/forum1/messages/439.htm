As an answer to: <A HREF="438.htm">Tight Foreskin and Frenuloplasty</A> written by Andy at 01 Jun 2000 12:22:35:
  <P> Wait a couple of weeks, until things have healed properly, and see if the 
    foreskin problem is solved. If not, go to a trusted urologist and get a short 
    dorsal slit, just long enough to relieve the problem for good. About 5 minutes 
    of very minor surgery could relieve most of the foreskin problems that confront 
    uncircumcised young men. Best wishes, RJK.<BR>
    >I yesterday had a frenuloplasty to relieve a tight foreskin. On searching 
    through the messages on this board and other Internet sites I cannot find 
    any link between this operation and the relief from a tight foreskin. Can 
    anyone advise whether they have had this operation as a relief or have I been 
    badly advised by the physician.?

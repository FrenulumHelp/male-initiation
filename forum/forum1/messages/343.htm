  <P> >I was thinking of having frenuloplasty done on me, but I'm kinda worried 
    about what it's going to look like. Would anyone have a site with pictures 
    of before and after the surgery?<BR>
    >Thanks<BR>
    You shouldn't be concerned about how it looks- except for when you are erect 
    and retracted- you will not even be able to tell- I do not even have a scar 
    from it- write directly if you want to<BR>

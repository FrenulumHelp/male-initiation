>I have concluded that part of my problem is called "smegma"....a lubricant that the foreskin produces. In 32 years, I have never produced this smegma, or at least it was such a miniscule amount that I have never noticed it. I have always been confused about the discussions of keeping an uncircumsised penis clean, because I have never had to worry about it....it has always been clean, which I thought was due to being sanitary and taking a shower every day. Well, in the last 2 weeks or so, I have had to clean myself 3 or 4 times a day.<BR>
>This is my first concern.....why is it surfacing now, and is there something I can do to get my old self back?<P>
The same thing happened to me.  You've got balanitis, an infection.  The doctor can give you some antibiotics that will cure it in a few days.  "Nizoral" is what he had me take.  Mine was caused by soap getting under the foreskin and irritating the head.

Hi Dave from Northampton<P>
glad you`re seeing your GP, and naturally I`m late, ... but to your first letter - a very interesting observation, not being fully hard is reported, but seldom together with sex lasting longer ... thanks<P>
>2) Although the ring feels sore all the way around, its most sore where its attached on the underside. I regularly get broken blood vessels, sometimes large.
  <P> you say its sore where its attached on the underside, you haven`t got frenulum 
    breve as well have you? please see <A HREF="../../../frenulum_breve.html#start">http://www.male-initiation.net/frenulum_breve.html</A>
  <P>
>Also, I masturbate very gently - no choice - and it seems to be getting worse not better.<BR>
>I think its just Phimosis, but as it gets tighter the soreness is most apparent where it joins the head <P>
what does the GP say, at a guess Id say the frenulum started irritating as the phimosis developed, ... if you can still get your foreskin back when flaccid ... , can you tell me: does it looks as though the ring curves back and joins into the frenulum, ??????<P>
you might need the frenulum cutting, and then I suggest you join in with the betamethasone trend which has invaded this list recently. ... as yet no known bad effects, ... <P>

I have noticed I have a lot of crap (smegma I believe) under my foreskin,<BR>
its nasty but it is also what allows me to help pull down my foreskin.<BR>
this is because it makes it a little slippery which aids in the foreskin going<BR>
down - nevertheless its still tight and while I think I can pull the foreskin<BR>
totally down past the glans when not hard I fear its going to get stuck -<BR>
I need advice, should I attempt to pull it past the glans even though its so<BR>
tight (I don't feel that much pain)

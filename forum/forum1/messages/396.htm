>I 'm 19 yrs old, when my penis is flaccid I can retract my foreskin near the glandes, when erect i cannot.I saw an urologist, he visited me and said I am perfectly healty.I told him I cannot retract while in erection but he said it was normal...<BR>
>Is he Jokin'???<BR>
>Am I "normal"???<BR>
>Can i have sex???How??
  <P> I am 15 and my foreskin comes to a long point that is very narrow at the 
    tip. I can pull my skin down when my dick is soft but it kinda hurts and it's 
    hard to do. When I have a stiffie, there's no way that I can pull it back 
    over the knob. I don't have any problems with a wank, it feels great. In sex-ed 
    they also said that the foreskin needs to come back but I know that my brother's 
    foreskin is tighter than mine and he has sex with his girl friend all the 
    time, so I know that it's possible. I know he has some lube he buys at the 
    sex shoppe. I don't have any problems, so I'm not too worried except I make 
    sure my mum or dad don't see me naked in case they think my dick needs to 
    be circumcised. Yuk, I don't like that.

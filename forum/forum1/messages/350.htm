I have had phimosis all my life (16 years) and until now it has not affected me in any way. I have found that most men can retract there foreskin back over their glans, but I can just go over half of it.  My glans is also very sensitive and I hate touching it. I have not started a sexual relationship because of this matter, but it has had no drawbacks on masturbation. What can I do to stop this from happening?

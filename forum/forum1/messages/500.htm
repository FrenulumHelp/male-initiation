As an answer to: <A HREF="497.htm">reply</A> written by joe at 16 Jul 2000 09:28:29:
  <P> Joe, don't worry about the size of it. Just go ahead and enjoy it. Chances 
    you're more concerned with size than is your lady friend, & if she is, chances 
    are you should find another lady friend. You could go to someone who specializes 
    in such things & have it surgically augmented, but as somebody else indicated, 
    you're really not going to be better off after the cutting. Good luck, Bob.<BR>
    >>There is no non-surgical way to increase penis size, and there are many 
    risks with surgery. Also, smoking has nothing to do with it (though there 
    are other good reasons to give up smoking). But why worry ?? Five inches is 
    well within the normal range.<BR>
    >>For a good discussion of penis size, try:<BR>
    >>http://www.the-penis.com/size.html<BR>
    >>The pleasure you give (to yourself and your partners) has little to with 
    size. So enjoy :-)<BR>
    >><BR>
    >>>I am 18 years old. My erect penile size is close to 5 inches. I'm kina 
    depressed here. Is there any non-surgical way to induce growth? Also how much 
    (if at all) can I expect it to grow? Last question: Does smoking affect size 
    and growth of the penis, wil it help to quit now? I appreciate all info I 
    can get. Thanks<BR>
    >There is a procedure where you cut a ligament or something, which adds about 
    an inch to your size, but the penis cant point up when erect, it stays at 
    a 90 degree angle. Another way is to take fat from your leg and add it, but 
    thats risky. Best bet is to ask your doctor.</BLOCKQUOTE>

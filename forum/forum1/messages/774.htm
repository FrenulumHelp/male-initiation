  <P> Raymond: Look, don't worry about it! It's really not a problem. Penises 
    come in many sizes and shapes, and most of them work reasonably well. However 
    if, on starting an active sex life, you find that the shape of your penis 
    prevents you from engaging in lovemaking to the satisfaction of your significant 
    other, that will be the time when it's a problem & needs to be shown to a 
    doctor for advice and remediation. In the meantime, keep your cool & don't 
    be overly concerned about where it's aimed. (Have you heard the country & 
    western song, "Dear Penis" on the Internet? It's concerned to some extent 
    with this condition which the penis's owner, Rodney, perceives as a problem. 
    If you haven't heard it, again don't worry: it's not worth making much effort 
    to find it.) Cheers and, again, keep your cool! RJK.<BR>
    >Raymond: I had the same situation when I was a teen (I'm almost 50 now). 
    I think it was the briefs that mother bought for me. My penis would always 
    'fall down' and then I would get hard and I would be forced into a very uncomfortable 
    situation, forcing a strong curve down between my legs. In college I switched 
    to boxers. Now there is no forcing from erections. It took awhile, but I no 
    longer bend down when erect. Maybe it's just because I'm 50, but I think it 
    has to do with the briefs. If you can't stand boxers, try to find some briefs 
    that will point you upwards and keep you that way so that erections don't 
    'fold' your penis downward.

>I am 27 years old and as far back as I can remember my foreskin has stayed fully retracted, I can pull it forward without any problems but it rolls right the way back leaving my glans fully exposed.  Is there anything I can do to keep it pulled forward?<BR>
The same as you - my foreskin is also permanently back and have experienced no ill effects - the odd look aside when changing etc.<BR>
Most people I have shared this with have said that it seems to be the best of both worlds - cleanness plus enlarged glans

As an answer to: <A HREF="602.htm">Urologist in Raleigh,NC for Frenuloplasty</A> written by helpme at 24 Aug 2000 00:43:01:
  <P> Suggest you contact the Duke University School of Medicine at Durham. They're 
    recognized internationally as a reputable outfit and are likely to refer you 
    to a competent, helpful physician. More than likely you won't be the first 
    one he/she's seen with a problem like yours. Good luck! RJK.<BR>

    to help me in this matter. I wanted to know if there is somebody nearby Raleigh\Chapel 
    Hill\Durham who has had this kind of operation and can suggest some very good 
    Urologist Surgeons whom I can consult.<BR>

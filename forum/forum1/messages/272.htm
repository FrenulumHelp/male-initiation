    >Hey Dean (or anyone else who has had this),<BR>
    > I was just wondering what the operation to correct frenulum breve is like. 
    Is it painfull afterwards? Is it weird being under only local anesthetic? 
    How long until it was fully funtioning again? Were there any signs that you 
    had an operation? (ie. scars, etc.) Thanks...<BR>
    Ken--<BR>
    Really this barely "qualifies" as an operation!! the local anes- is put in 
    with a very tiny thin needle after some 'numbing cream' is put on so you really 
    don't feel it- In my case- it was trimmed away from the glans so that when 
    it healed- there is no sign it was ever connected there as I can not see a 
    scar and I suspect there were few nerves that went into the underside of the 
    glans at that connection because I don't think I lost any of the feeling in 
    the frenulum- it merely retreated into the inner foreskin and forms a little 
    bit of a ridge there now. On healing- everyone heals at different speeds and 
    I drove 500 miles in sub-zero weather and was in and out of the car because 
    I had a horse trailer and this was on the same day mine was done. I took about 
    three weeks before it was completely healed even tho it was 'usable' in about 
    a week!<BR>
    You may get another bonus-- as I did with an extra bit of length! Hope this 
    is helpful- if you need more info- email me<BR>

    >>>Ok. This is the problem. Ever since I was I child I relised that my foreskin 
    didn't retract fully when erect (no problem when soft), but I thought it was 
    normal. Masterbation was no problem, but when I become sexually active I noticed 
    that something was wrong. I can now retract it when erect so that it is just 
    no longer covering the head , but it is still painfull. I also noticed that 
    my frenulum was very tight and was being pulled by the foreskin. My GP <BR>
    >><BR>
    >>said I should stretch it in the bath, but I was the last patient on a Sunday 
    and it didn't really seem like he gave a damn. After being with my girlfriend 
    one day I noticed a tiny rip on my frenulum, so I believe I have frenulum 
    breve. When soft, and I retract my foreskin fully (ie. not just past the head, 
    but fully stretching the skin out), it pulls the head of my penis so that 
    it is almost at a 90 degree angle... Is Frenulum Breve my problem? Does anyone 
    else know what I mean? Do I need an operation? Please help...<BR>
    >>You certainly described what I had! it was a very simple operation in the 
    Urologists office- deadened the area underneath and trimmed the frenulum away 
    from the underside of the glans or head. absolutely changed everything! has 
    been wonderful- can retract fully even when erect and it doesn't bunch up 
    or form a tight ring behind the head when erect- of course some continued 
    stretching is necessary- again -- yes it sure sounds like frenulum breve - 
    email me if you want to discuss more<BR>

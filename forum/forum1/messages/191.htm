God I didn't realise problems like these were so common!!!!  I don't know if I've got a problem or not or maybe I don't want to admit it because the thought of having surgery scares me big time!!  I've got a phobia of it!!  The bit the attatches my foreskin to my helmet (glands??)  seems tight and It seems like it either needs snipping off or making longer!  Its alright when its floppy but when its erect its tight!  I can get my foreskin over my tip and all that and pull it back but it just seems a bit uncomfortable!  Is this normal??  Is there anything I can do without having surgery?  I think I could bare being awake and having it done (as long as its numb obviously!!!)  If anyone can help me I'd really appreciate it as things like this tend to worry me until I think about them all the time!<P>
Thanks<BR>
Craig

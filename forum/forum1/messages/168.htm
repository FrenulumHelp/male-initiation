Hello everybody, i'mreally glad there is a sit strictlyon uncircumsized males and problems. Anyways i was wondering if anyone could help me, lately i've been really horny and have been masturbating quite a bit and for a while there was this pain right near the top of my skin, kinda where the skin starts to roll inside your penis, near the top, well anyway the more and more i played with myself the more it hurt, it looked like little rips in my skin, my father sid it was from my skin being dry and me playing wtih myself. Well no the problem has gotten worse,at the skin at the top of my penis, it is really tight and it hurts to roll my skin back when i'm erect, it feels like its riping, also when i'm not hard and pull the skin back the tightness feels the a tight band around the bottom of my head? I really hope someone can help me. If anyone has any advise PLEASE LET ME KNOW Email me at Echo-007 at excite.com PLEASE.

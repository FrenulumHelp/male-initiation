Hi Roxane...<P>
Thank you for sharing your story with me, I truly appreciate the support...what was the outcome with your little boy?  Did the problem correct itself?  <P>
Hope all is well now...<P>

>>Hi...I need help...<BR>
>>My baby boy was cir'd at a day old.  Now he's 10 months old and it appears that the skin has grown back where the "ridge" should be. <BR>
>>I consulted with two different doctors and got two different answers.  One says "leave it alone, the skin will detach by itself"..another says "you gotta rip the skin apart otherwise it will get worse."<BR>
>>What should I do?  I dread the thought of putting my son through this "ripping" procedure since I understand they do not use anesthesia.  Is there anyone out there who has been through this. I really need help cuz I've been crying over this for days....<BR>
>>Thanks...<BR>

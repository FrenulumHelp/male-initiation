Tony- <BR>
No reason to feel "stupid" about this. Many men spend their whole lives without ever 'digging' in to learn about their own bodies-- especially their penis!!At least you are in the process of learning.<BR>
From your description, I would guess the 'skin' you describe underneath is your frenulum- or it could be a skin bridge.<BR>
In terms of what is "normal"- I dont' think you could really say what "normal" is. I think we all have a penis that is a little different than someone elses- but then there are some things that probably fit as "normal"<BR>
There are pictures of intact males located at http:/www.circumstitions.com/gallery1.html<BR>
good luck<BR>

As an answer to: <A HREF="443.htm">pulling foreskin down</A> written by Rich at 05 Jun 2000 01:17:33:
  <P> Yes Rich, you definitely should pull the foreskin back as far as you can 
    regularly (every day when showering if possible), because that is what is 
    needed to loosen the foreskin to the degree that it can be pulled back at 
    any time for cleaning (or any other activity). When you pull it back, the 
    glans and foreskin area should be carefully washed with mild soap and warm 
    water to clean out any old smegma and dirt that may be present. This keeps 
    unpleasant smells from developing (also possible infections), and this is 
    a plus since nobody (definitely including girls) appreciates them. Don't worry 
    about the foreskin becoming trapped behind the glans; as your stretching progresses 
    this will become less and less likely. If it should get stuck behind the glans, 
    all you need to do is compress the glans between a thumb and forefinger until 
    you press enough blood out of the glans to reduce its size, so the foreskin 
    can then slip forward past it. Looks like you're well on the way to ending 
    any remaining foreskin problems and joining the majority of normal men. Congratulations! 
    Bob. <BR>

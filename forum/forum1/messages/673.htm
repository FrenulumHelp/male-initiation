>Does anybody have experience with a topical steroid treatment of phimosis?  I have a mild case of phimosis and have just been prescribed a 0.5% betamethasone cream.  Now I am a little confused as to how to apply the cream.  Most resources on the internet say you have to apply it "externally" -- it sounds as though they mean on the "very outside" of the prepuce.  When I mentioned this to my doctor he chuckled and said that I would have to unroll it completely before applying the cream, otherwise it is totally uneffective.  However, this seems a little odd to me.  The part of my foreskin that is the most tight (sort of a narrow ring) is always on the outside, even if I pull the foreskin all the way down.  Pulling it down does not expose it any more or less.  Does anybody have some advice for me? <BR>
>Also, to those who have undergone a topical steroid treatment -- did you find it worked?  How long did you use it?  Where the effects lasting?<BR>
>I really appreciate any bit of information that could help me become unconfused!  Thanks guys!<P>
Person a bit further down recommended the cream to me, and gave me these instructions for applying it...<P>
"Apply it once per day to the **outside** of your foreskin from the opening tip to about mid glans (mid head). You should be retractable while soft in a few weeks but to get retractable while erect should take about 7-8 weeks"<P>
Hope that helps ;-)

As an answer to: <A HREF="527.htm">Bared Glans</A> written by John at 27 Jul 2000 13:18:41:<P>
I also have a naturally bard glans.  I for one wish that I did not.  It is really uncomfortable to wear boxers, but at the same time, I do not like tight underwear.  I wonder if this is as a result of medical advice I got as a kid.  My foreskin was attached to the ridge around the glans and when I urinated, I'd spray who knows where.  The doc said every night I ought to pull the foresjin back--it did result in the foreskin slowly tearing away from the ridge on the glans, and I could aim.  But the foreskin is loose and does not cover the glans now.  I wonder if the muscle in the frenar band (the "ridge" of skin aroung the tip of the foreskin when "closed") was not overstretched?  Is there any way to correct this?  I want to be covered.

  <P> Tony, you are not alone, because lots of people have this problem, myself 
    included in days gone by, and I guess it is one of the things that inspired 
    the creation of this forum. You are developing secondary phimosis, and it 
    sounds as if you need treatment to stop it getting worse. I suggest you look 
    at all the items called "Phimosis" in the site http://members.tripod.co.uk/origins 
    <A HREF="../../../welcome.html#start">now: Male Initiation.net</A>), where it's 
    all discussed, and the various cures are given. It's unlikely to be a serious 
    matter, if only for the reason that it can always cured by circumcision if 
    it has to be, but if you dont want to be circumcised, you need to do something 
    about it now, or otherwise it will get so bad that there will be no choice 
    but circumcision. Gentle stretching together with healing creams may work, 
    but also, they may not, and if so dont hesitate to get medical help. Other 
    cures are dorsal slits, partial circs, and so on, all written up in the reference. 
  <P> Peter. </BLOCKQUOTE>

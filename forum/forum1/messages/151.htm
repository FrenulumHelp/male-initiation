  <P> Andrew, I'm sure your girlfriend is right when she says you ought to do something 
    about it, because the trouble is that if you keep getting little cuts, each 
    time they heal they leave a bit of scar tissue, and this is less elastic that 
    the rest of your foreskin, and the result will be that it gets tighter and 
    not looser. This is widely recognised, there's several comments saying so 
    in this forum, and also in the website <A HREF="../../../index.html#start">http://www.male-initiation.net/</A>, 
    and I can confirm it from my own experience. There's various things to do 
    about it, like gentle stretching with creams, or dorsal slits, or partial 
    circumcisions in which just the end of the foreskin is cut off, and these 
    are all talked about in the website, mainly under "phimosis". If your foreskin 
    is not too tight, which seems to be the case, one or other of these solutions 
    will probably be OK. If you go to a doctor and (as well may happen) he says 
    circumcision is the only solution, there is nothing to be scared about, since 
    all you have to do is say No. But there's no need to be scared of circumcision 
    either if in the end it comes to that. Adult circumcision is not painful or 
    stressful, and there's a billion guys who are cut (a billion and one, counting 
    me), and the great bulk of us are happy with it. This forum is neither pro 
    nor anti - nor am I - but there are people for whom it's the best solution.
  <P>
Peter.

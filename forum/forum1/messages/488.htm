I had this done- I too had tried unsuccessfully to "clip" mine but just with <BR>
my fingernails rather than a razor blade.<BR>
I am glad I was unsuccessful since I had it done by a urologist. He trimmed <BR>
it completely away from the head and it healed with no scar. My foreskin now <BR>
moves back all the way as it should.<BR>
Don't try to do it yourself- get to a professional and it will be simple and <BR>
practically painless and will heal quickly<BR>
If you are in the US, I can almost assure you, your doctor will tell you that you need to be circumcised- just hold firm and say "NO"- all you need is the frenulum trimmed!<BR>

&gt;&gt;I recently found out about this frenulum. I've been aware of its existence for a long time but didn't know too much about it. Initially I thought it was nothing but a sinew which was for some reason holding my forehead back severely, I could pull the forehead over the head but there the frenulum kept it from rejecting any further.

I have a couple of questions,
&gt;&gt;If I try a little harder, is it really possible for me to cut the frenulum off with a razorblade? 
&gt;&gt;I've heard about the &quot;surgical&quot; procedure. What does it really accomplish? Is the frenulum attached further down?  Can I completely remove the frenulum or is it a necessity? 
&gt;&gt;Can this operation be made on everyone, even though I have some veins rather close the frenulum? 
&gt;&gt;I would really appreciate answers and responses. 
&gt;&gt;I am rather worried.

&gt;Pete-
&gt;I had this done- I too had tried unsuccessfully to &quot;clip&quot; mine but just with 
&gt;my fingernails rather than a razor blade.
&gt;I am glad I was unsuccessful since I had it done by a urologist. He trimmed 
&gt;it completely away from the head and it healed with no scar. My foreskin now 
&gt;moves back all the way as it should.
&gt;Don't try to do it yourself- get to a professional and it will be simple and 
&gt;practically painless and will heal quickly
&gt;If you are in the US, I can almost assure you, your doctor will tell you that you need to be circumcised- just hold firm and say &quot;NO&quot;- all you need is the frenulum trimmed!

>To a large extent this is not aproblem unless you percieve it to be! Personally I feel that having the glans exposed after puberty is part of natures plan tho imperfectly achieved.<P>
The intacters have opinned that the glans nust be covered and have called it and the foreskin a mucous membrane, whereas my first learning was definietely that it is not- otherwise neither glans nor foreskin would do as well as they do exposed. Any change in sensation will only take away the oversensitivity. Withj the glans not covered the glans will gradually expand a bit compared to a covered glans and will provide increase pleasure and orgasm triggering at the corrona.
  <P> I speak from over 60yrs experience following puberty with being "skinned 
    back" Some Drs. a century ago, before the increase in The US circ rate were 
    suggesting that the foreskin be trained to stay back for better cleanliness 
    and to improve disease rejection. <BR>
    It isn't necessary to "correct" your bared glans since this condition occurs 
    naturally in thousands of men, particularly after they start to have normal 
    adult sexual activity. If you really want to change it, you might try pulling 
    the foreskin forward so it covers the glans as much as possible, then fastening 
    it in that position with adhesive tape and keeping it that way for a couple 
    of weeks, by which time it should be "accustomed" to staying forward. If it 
    doesn't stay forward after that, there probably isn't much you can do unless 
    you go to a plastic surgeon for painful and expensive "remedial" work (which 
    many people would consider totally unnecessary). It seems strange that you 
    find the bared glans uncomfortable; I never ran into anybody who reported 
    experiencing discomfort from having a naturally bare glans. (Or a glans bare 
    from circumcision either; the glans usually loses any hypersensitivity with 
    prolonged exposure and in time comes to feel perfectly natural. Maybe yours 
    will reach that condition one of these days?<BR>
    >>I also have a naturally bard glans. I for one wish that I did not. It is 
    really uncomfortable to wear boxers, but at the same time, I do not like tight 
    underwear. I wonder if this is as a result of medical advice I got as a kid. 
    My foreskin was attached to the ridge around the glans and when I urinated, 
    I'd spray who knows where. The doc said every night I ought to pull the foresjin 
    back--it did result in the foreskin slowly tearing away from the ridge on 
    the glans, and I could aim. But the foreskin is loose and does not cover the 
    glans now. I wonder if the muscle in the frenar band (the "ridge" of skin 
    aroung the tip of the foreskin when "closed") was not overstretched? Is there 
    any way to correct this? I want to be covered.

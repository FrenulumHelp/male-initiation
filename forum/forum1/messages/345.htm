I don't think there are any risks , although I can't say that I'm 100% <BR>
certain .. Personally I've been using betamethasone for a month now and the<BR>
foreskin is a bit looser and I can retract it a lot - but only when I am<BR>
not erect.<BR>
Ask your doctor about it, good luck.
  <P> >I have heard about these creams....and on one site (such as the stretching 
    technique site) someone mentioned theres some risks with using cream. Is this 
    true--is it safe to use it? Because I'd rather use the cream first (if it's 
    safe and not risky).<BR>

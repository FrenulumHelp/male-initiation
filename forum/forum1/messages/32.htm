Hello Steve,<P>
>I'm a 33 male and I have, as far as I can tell, phimosis. ...<P>
I was 43 before I realised, someone last week was 40, its all one of life`s rich experiences ...<P>
>It was only when I got older that I realised that my penis was different and it was really brought home to me by a girlfriend who seemed disappointed that the foreskin didn't retract at all. <BR>
><BR>
>I can get the foreskin back when my penis is flaccid (for cleaning) but it does not move back at all when I am erect. <BR>
><BR>
>I have to say that it hasn't really affected my sex life (or maybe it has and I'm just not getting as much from it as I should be!) but the idea of circumcision has always scared me as I have heard so many bad tales about too much being taken off.<P>
yes you do NOT need a full circumcision, dorsal slit or a partial are almost certainly enough - but before I can sensibly think any further, we need a full diagnosis, ... if you can retract the foreskin when flaccid, you will be able to see if there is a phimotic ring, 
  <P> <A HREF="../../../phimosis_research.html#start">http://www.male-initiation.net/phimosis_research.html</A>
  <P>
what extent of "hourglass" effect is there? ... what I`m wondering is with a partial phimosis, some degree of retraction should be possible when erect, if not, it may be combined with frenulum breve, so I`m asking if you have frenulum breve.<P>
maybe a good way of telling this for you would be when flaccid with the foreskin retracted, turn the glans over, and look, is the foreskin under the glans very much drawn into the "V" shape of the glans? or does the "V" shape lie free ... (how you see it will be an upside down "V" shape unless you`ve tied it in a knot by now :-)<P>
The other check for frenulum breve is when erect does the attempt at retraction cause the glans to bend downwards.<P>
you might be advised to get the<BR>

  <P>
You should realise that even with a combination of these conditions a full circumcision is still a rather meaningless way of trying to cure this.<P>
lets get it diagnosed - good luck, - <P>

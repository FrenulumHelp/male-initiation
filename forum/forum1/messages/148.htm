I had a frenuloplasty carried out several months ago.  The procedure seems to have failed as the foreskin still cannot be retracted during erection.  It is slightly more comfortable though during penetration.
  <P> The urologist has recommended against a dorsal slit and is reluctant to 
    go to full circumcision. What next? Any suggestions? </BLOCKQUOTE>

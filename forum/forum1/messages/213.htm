Hey Dave, save up your pennies & pounds (or Euros) &<BR>
come over on a quick trip to the USA.  Almost any MD<BR>
here will be glad to take care of you with a d.s., but<BR>
of course there'll be a charge for it.  I don't know<BR>
what the going rate is, but it shouldn't be excessive.<BR>
You might combine it with a trip to DisneyWorld (d.s.<BR>
was long a traditional treatment for baby boys in the<BR>
Orlando area); after the first couple of days you<BR>
shouldn't have much pain, and you'd probably be<BR>
completely mobile right after the surgery.  On the<BR>
other hand the NHS should cover it at no charge (or<BR>
minimal cost), but perhaps someone in the UK can<BR>
answer the "how long" question; I certainly can't. <BR>
Lots of luck, Bob.

That's fantastic, Ed!<BR>
I applaud your doctor for being open to trying something new.<BR>
If you don't see results with the Hydrocortisone don't get discouraged. If you read Nick's posting you'll notice he said it took several weeks and that was with the betamethasone.<BR>
We noticed results with the Kenalog we used on my son in a matter of days, but I don't know if that was due to the strength of the cream or the fact that he was so young.<BR>
Please let me (and the forum) know how things go. <BR>

  <P> >I saw my doctor last night, and armed with all the info from the web managed 
    to convince him to let me try the cream. We both studied some of the articles 
    and he suggested I go with Hydrocortisone 1% first as it is milder, and if 
    that does not work after six weeks he will put me on the Betamethasone 0.05%. 
    I am happy to go along with him on that, at least I have got him off his dogmatic 
    suggestion I get circumcised which is the standard UK remedy to this problem.<BR>
    >Thanks for the advise, it is great being able to talk to someone who has 
    been through this already.<BR>

    >>Print this up:<BR>
    >>http://www.cirp.org/library/treatment/phimosis/dewan/<BR>
    >>and take Nick's account of how the cream worked for him.<BR>
    >>If this doesn't get you the prescription, I have contacted the head of "D.O.C.<BR>
    >>(Doctors Opposing Circumcission) to see if he has the names of some foreskin 
    friendly doctors in the UK. He's the man who helped us to find the doctor 
    who helped us.<BR>
    >>I'll send you more websites if I find any I think are better than this one 
    and will post the names of UK doctors who are familiar with the topical steroid<BR>
    >>treatment (if Dr. Denniston knows of any). You're not the only one in the 
    UK having difficulty finding a doctor willing to try anything other than circumcission.<BR>
    >>I don't understand the ignorance, after all you guys have been leaving your 
    males intact while we've been circ'ing ours. Therefore your doctors should 
    be more aware of alternatives to circumcission than ours (ours are horribly 
    ignorant on this subject as well though).<BR>
    >>Anyway, let me know how you fare and you'll be hearing from me again.<BR>

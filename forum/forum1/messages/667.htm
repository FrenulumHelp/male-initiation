I had pinhole phimosis all my life and never been able to touch the head of penis until after I had my surgery 12 weeks ago. Im 30 years old. I have been told that gradually the feeling in the head will be less sensitive. But its very hard for me to touch the head. Theres no problems to masturbate when the foreskin covers the glans but its impossible to touch the head with my hands, and if I try Its very painful and I lose the erection. <BR>
Any other with similar problems? I appreciate your answers.<BR>

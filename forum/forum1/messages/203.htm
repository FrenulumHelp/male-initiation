Hello Craig <P>
you`re describing frenulum breve ... need a frenoplasty (sounds groovy dont it) no circumcision, just the tight bit needs cutting through<P>
go to <BR><FONT SIZE="2">

or<BR>
<A HREF="../../../welcome.html#start">www.male-initiation.net</A><P>

good luck<BR>

  <P> >God I didn't realise problems like these were so common!!!! I don't know 
    if I've got a problem or not or maybe I don't want to admit it because the 
    thought of having surgery scares me big time!! I've got a phobia of it!! The 
    bit the attatches my foreskin to my helmet (glands??) seems tight and It seems 
    like it either needs snipping off or making longer! Its alright when its floppy 
    but when its erect its tight! I can get my foreskin over my tip and all that 
    and pull it back but it just seems a bit uncomfortable! Is this normal?? Is 
    there anything I can do without having surgery? I think I could bare being 
    awake and having it done (as long as its numb obviously!!!) If anyone can 
    help me I'd really appreciate it as things like this tend to worry me until 
    I think about them all the time!<BR>
    >Thanks<BR>

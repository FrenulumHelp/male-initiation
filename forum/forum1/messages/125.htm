Hi, Bob, <P>
	The tightness of your foreskin (phimosis) when you are erect is common, and I had it myself in days gone by.  If you look up in the website at <A HREF="../../../welcome.html#start">www.male-initiation.net</A>, there are several files dealing with it, and how to cure it without circumcision, and since yours doesn’t seem too bad, my guess is that they’ll probably work.  My own experience is that tightness like yours should ease itself by gentle stretching, a bit every night,  together with a bit of cream ointment.  But be careful not to break the skin, because the scar tissue that forms when it heals makes it all tighter than when you started.  As for the strip of skin underneath, this is the frenulum, and everybody starts out by having one.  It is only a trouble if it is too short (when it is called frenulum breve), and again, the website has things on it.  In my own case, mine was no trouble, and anyhow it just broke one day while I was wanking, which was fine for me, but some guys have trouble with it. I think that in most cases, if it is a nuisance, it can be snipped without much trouble.<P>
Peter.

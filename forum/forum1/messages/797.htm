>>Hi. I have one testicle and I want the names of support groups for men with my problem. I also want to know if there is a procedure out there that would give me a second testicle. Please respond<BR>

>The one you have can do everything by itself.  The other one was only a spare.  If there is really such a thing as a support group for THIS, I can only shake my head and wonder what kind of wimps men are becoming.  Yes, you can get a silicone implant to simulate the missing family jewel, if its really so important.<P>
You really are something else aren't you? - do you have no understanding of anyone else's feelings, or are you really such a self-centred, unfeeling b*****d?

Phimosis hasnt affected you in any way, except it protected the glans so well that now you hate touching your own glans - <P>
 - do you want to treat the phimosis or just the hypersensitivity? - I`ll take the question on gace value. ... interesting idea that some youths could get put off retraction because of this hyper sensitive problem ..<P>
I used to suggest anaesthetic cream  ..  Nick (on another thread) suggests a dental anaesthetic, which brings me to the natural all time anaesthetic: cloves, --- and oil of cloves can be bought at any chemists without embarrassment, (say its for your bad tooth) , diluted (with olive oil), test it on your mouth, and then apply a little at a time to your glans, ... <P>
please feedback on progress <BR>

    >I have had phimosis all my life (16 years) and until now it has not affected 
    me in any way. I have found that most men can retract there foreskin back 
    over their glans, but I can just go over half of it. My glans is also very 
    sensitive and I hate touching it. I have not started a sexual relationship 
    because of this matter, but it has had no drawbacks on masturbation. What 
    can I do to stop this from happening? <BR>

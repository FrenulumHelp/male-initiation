Sounds more like frenulum breve, where the tissue at the bottom of the penis head (frenulum)is too short & binds the foreskin to the bottom of the penis.  It's usually not life-threatening but can be a damned nuisance.  Taking it to a doctor you know and trust (if there is such a one nearby) is a good idea.  If you don't know such a doctor, now's a good time to find one.  Best wishes, RJK.

When we are having sex, my boyfriend sometimes has pain or bleeds from the underside of the head (where the V is I think, he won't let me see).  He also sometimes has problems inserting as the foreskin is being pulled backwards and the bit under the head stretches/hurts.<P>
What is the problem and is there anyway to solve it rather than going to the doctor - it's kind of a touchy/embarassing subject for him, something abou this manliness being questioned so I have to be tactful.<P>
Also, he sometimes smells a bit fishy/yucky under the foreskin as I think it doesn't go all the way back (is there meant to be a fold still or when you pull back is it meant to look smooth?) What can I tactfully suggest especially if it is a movement problem of the foreskin.  BTW there is no visible substance.<P>
Thanks!!

>>Since a lot of years I try to keep my foreskin back. We are very often at a nudist beach in Europe an my wife wants me to pull the foreskin back. That works only for two days. After this time my foreskin starts to swallow and it slips over the glans. Does anybody knows if it is dangerous, to retract the foreskin, what can happen. My wife an me enjay ist, but we don*t want to circumzise. (sorry for the mistakes, I'm from germany)<P>
>No problem with the mistakes! you do much better with English than I can with German!!! <BR>
>I too have kept my foreskin back- at times for several weeks or months. I don't think there is a problem with doing it- the only concern I would have is if you get too much sun on the sensitive "inner skin" or the glans. I would certainly put some good sunscreen on it if you are going to be in the sun where it can absorb too much sun while it is tender. Mine does not have a tendency to go back over the glans on its own unless it is rubbed by my clothes- which should be no problem with no clothes on!!<BR>
>cheers<P>
The sun is not the problem, because I don't like to expose me to the sun. Once i've got a little sunburn on the glans, cause I slept in the afternoon at the beach, under a tree but the sun beams got reach my genitals.  No, the real problem is, that I think, that I lost of the glans sensivity. I feel very less during the intercouse, so that I loose my erection. During masturbation by myself or my my helpful wife, I only get feelings by stimulating the frenulum. Therefore I think, that the foreskin did kill the nerves in (at , on ) the glans. Some years ago, I've been at a urogolist (doctor) and I asked him, if ist is dangerous to retract the foreskin and he ansered no go ahead. He would like to circumzise me, an I said that I only want to keep the Fs back. He ment that it wouldn't be dangerous. An now I'm disappointet. In summer time me an my wife were really a little bit proud, that during the whole day my glans was nude.The years before, I was always a little bit afraid to walk with my nude glans in our Nudist club. Bat this year ist was great. But now whre is the sensitiviy. May someone else has the same experience, and if it would be true, we should declare ist to men, who want to do the same.<BR>
Thanks for your answer<P>

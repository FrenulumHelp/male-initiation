As an answer to: <A HREF="263.htm">not able to retract since birth</A> written by Alan at 16 Feb 2000 07:07:09:
  <P> Yes, there are many creams, gels, ointments and salves that people try with 
    various degrees of results. This is another case where the sufferer uses the 
    term "no problem" except it IS a problem. This guy is at the peak of his sexual 
    development and should not be robbed of its pleasures by defending an unborn 
    penis. This forum is so full of stories like this you would believe that half 
    of Europe has phimosis and soon it will invade America as routine circumcision 
    is being abandoned. Boys, your foreskin is -made- to retract for a reason. 
    Use it or lose it. Teach your little brothers and cousins and sons to skin 
    it back as soon as they can so they don't grow up with the problems you have.

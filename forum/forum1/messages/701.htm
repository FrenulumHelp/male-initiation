  <P> Not for a tenth of a second! The penis stays clean all the time without 
    any special effort; this isn't important when you have ready access to soap 
    and water but I know from personal experience that in some situations (notably 
    armed combat) where you can go for weeks without a shower, not having to worry 
    about smegma, dirt, etc. is a definite plus. Also, since the military, my 
    girlfriends (Americans all!) without exception have had no problem with my 
    being circumcised. Plus I've found sex to be a lot of fun and totally satisfying. 
    Remember, this is only my feeling. I am not urging, and would never urge you 
    or anybody else to rush out and get cut. It's your body, etc., and some men 
    don't like being circumcised. It's very much your decision, nobody else's. 
    Courage! RJK. <BR>
    >for anyone who has been cut - do you regret it? at all?<BR>

    not to get a circumcision. but now i have done more research in the pro-circumcision

    i find UNbiased info on this i.e. somewhere that is not pro one or the other?

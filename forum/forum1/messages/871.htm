hi,<P>
after a lot of disagreeing with a urologist, i got myself a 25g bottle of betamethasone .05% cream for my tight foreskin (so tight you <BR>
cannot see the entire urethral opening). nevertheless, there are a few questions i still have. i would appreciate feedback from anybody - successful or otherwise.  thanks in advance.<P>
<BR>
1.  how long before i start seeing SIGNIFICANT results?  how long will the   <BR>
treatment take (the urologist said to discontinue after a month)?<P>
sometimes i see the foreskin has 'loosened' up a bit.  then later on, i'll look at it again and the opening seems smaller and tighter  than before.  is that a problem?  normal?<P>
2.  i have noticed my foreskin and glans (what i can see of it) is very dry.  for example, when pulling back it sometimes feels like it's been on a hot leather seat for a few minutes.  is there anything wrong?  should i be concerned?  any suggestions?<P>
3.  the urologist mentioned that betamethasone causes thinning of the skin and other severe side effects. anybody with any info on that?<P>
4.  i also noticed (by shifting the opening of the foreskin like it was a peephole!) that part of the foreskin goes "inside" the hole and attaches to the ridge on the underside of the glans (frenelum is it called??).  is<BR>
that a problem/complication? will the betamethasone help with that?<P>
5.  i heard that olive oil helps the process...anybody try it?<P>
<BR>
i hope somebody can unconfuse me...thanks.  anybody with any stories that will give me an idea of what i'm actually dealing with will be helpful.  <P>
thanks...
  <P> ps - please tell me you're age when you had phimosis...is there anybody 
    else my <BR>
    age (19) with it?<BR>

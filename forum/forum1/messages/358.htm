I was thinking of using it to help what I think is a mild case of phimosis... Is that a good idea? Can anything go wrong? An I too old?<P>

&gt;&gt;Hi Ken
&gt;&gt;&gt;He also said that I should wait a while and see what happens first, 
&gt;&gt;in my phimosis treatment section I say &quot;this most useless bit of information was even offered to my Dad at age 75&quot; --- OK its possible that through masturbation stiffness will stretch, as you say 
&gt;&gt;&gt;it has become easier to retract while erect and can even a little less painfull.
&gt;&gt;__________
&gt;&gt;&gt;He seemed to think that the problem was the foreskin itself being too tight, but when erect and retracted I can obviously see that the frenulum is white from being strained and is painfull. 
&gt;&gt;Problem is that the doctors diagnose in the flaccid state - and dont see your phallus in action, a small discussion could diagnose most problems more accurately than examination of flaccid penis. 
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;The real pain comes if the foreskin is pulled upon when it is already retracted beyond the head. Perhaps I have both slight phimosis and frenulum breve? 
&gt;&gt;&gt;After being with my girlfriend one day I noticed a tiny rip on my frenulum,
&gt;&gt;Obviously you have frenulum breve, ... Im sure you can forget the phimosis, (or deal with that later), theres sure to be some symptomatic phimosis caused by fren.br.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Should I get just a frenuloplasty? YES Does it sould like a circ is neccessary. NO ---- A Frenoplasty or frenuloplasty is a well performed operation - studied, practiced, with all the perfection of modern medicine, (unlike circ.) .. and also its absolutely no problem to loose your frenulum.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Certainly sounds like Frenulum breve to me- you describe very much &gt;the situation I had and had corrected at age 24 with a frenulum trim &gt;which was very simple- Dean,

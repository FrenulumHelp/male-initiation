Thanks for responding .. I'm new to the cream thing .. Does this mean that an adult male as well, would need to regularly retract his foreskin even after getting successful results with the cream ?<BR>
I was wondering .. your son's condition .. the opening just gradually shrunk again ?<BR>
Right now I need to find a new urologist to help prescribe the cream.<BR>
Should I be asking for Kenalog or betamethasone ?<P>
>We were prescribed Kenalog cream for our son a couple of years ago. It is similar to the betamethasone so I imagine the price would be comparable.<BR>
>I don't remember the exact cost, but I do remember that it was quite reasonable.<BR>
>In my son's case the results haven't lasted, but that is because he was only about 7 when we used the cream and we could not get him to continue to retract his foreskin regularly to keep it loose.

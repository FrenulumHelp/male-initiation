As an answer to: <A HREF="760.htm">help! tight foreskin</A> written by annoyedveryimbarrest at 01 Nov 2000 00:39:44:<P>
I feel here we see a fear of the unknown, as the initiate hesitates for months and years wondering whether the horrendous effects of his foreskin complex may possibly have an effect on intercourse,<P>
Most of the answers are summarised on the welcome page of <A HREF="../../../welcome.html#start">www.male-initiation.net</A> All Boys Must Be Checked --- check out phimosis and
  
 <P> <A HREF="../../../paraphimosis.html#start"> paraphimosis</A> (and 
  ways to control it), - yes I know theres a bit to read and understand 
  and really the doctors should have taken care of it years ago, but 
  then sigh - this is all part of being a man in the modern world ... 
  (education/awareness is the best cure for ignorance) .. and if you 
  learn a bit about <A HREF="../../../phimosis/steroids.html#start">betamethsone</A> 
  .. and then if you ask the doctor for some - he will probably thank 
  you for making his days work easier 
 <P>
have fun<P>

hi<P>
i am an 22yr old male.<P>
i have a problem with my foreskin that i hope someone can help me with<P>
at the end of my foreskin it is very tight and the opening isnt really big enough for the head of my penis to go through so i can retract it.<P>
I can retract my foreskin so it is behind the head of my penis, but it takes a lot of effort to force it behind there.<P>
Also if i happen to get an erection when my foreskin is behind the head of my penis it is painful and like the head of my penis is being "strangled"<P>
if i try to uriniate when it is in this state it hurts and not much urine will come out.<P>
Sometimes it has taken me several hrs and much pain to get my foreskin back to its normal position after this, and if i have tried to urinate, when it finally goes back to its normal position urine comes out, i guess cause the pressure is released.<P>
has anyone got a solution to this problem?<P>
i am very scared of going to the doctor and i do not want to be circumcised.<P>
I dont know if this will cause problems when having intercourse, because i am a virgin.<P>
i can masturbate ok though<P>
thanks

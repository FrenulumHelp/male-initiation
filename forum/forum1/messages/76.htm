>hello again Steve,<P>
>thanks for the (small easy to download) jpeg<P>
Don't mention it<P>
>Interesting - you have a partial phimosis but also you have a curious frenulum which gathers in all the inner foreskin really close under the glans, - You can see if the prominent frenular ridge was cut just behind the glans, then the inner foreskin here would loosen out, <P>
I think I follow you here<P>
>So you definately need a frenuloplasty ... frenoplasty ... (is also used and at least the name is shorter) ... for the partial phimosis I`d still suggest partial circ.  but I received this today referring to Cuckow who is an expert in such matters<P>
>Dr P M. Cuckow:<BR>
>Hospital: Dept of  Paediatric Urology, Great Ormond Street Hospital, London<BR>
>WC1N 3JH.<P>
>Cuckow was very<BR>
>informative and, as you say, thoughtful.  He said full circ was the most<BR>
>guaranteed to heal with no problems but has done what he called a limited<BR>
>circ and advised "........" on the importance of retracting the foreskin<BR>
>regularly straight away.  ie not waiting until it feels better enough.  He<BR>
>says the chances of the partial circ closing again are high and regularly<BR>
>stretching the wound is the way to prevent this. <P>
So if I need both its a question of which one first I guess. I'm going to book an appointment with my doctor and run through the options which I have learned about here<P>

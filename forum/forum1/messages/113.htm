>If you do have frenulum breve as I did- a  very simple trimming of the frenulum away from the glans will be of great help<P>
<BR>
Totally agree, if you know you have frenulum breve, then no need to answer the other questions<P>
>>flaccid is there an hourglass effect around the shaft of the penis, which is the phimotic ring ...<BR>
><BR>
>>During flaccid I do not see a hourglass effect around the shaft.<P>
and what about half erect, ... or any discolouration in ring form<BR>
if you have no ring you dont need any worry about circumcision<P>
you will need to visit an Urologist.  you need the frenulum treating<P>
maybe trimming is similar to the method in "Part Two: Treatment" of<BR>

its the second picture by Hernaez Manrique which I`m thinking of .. I dont know if the pictures are clear enough for someone who is new to the theme to understand what the operations do ....?
  <P> Maybe you`d like to tell us?<BR>

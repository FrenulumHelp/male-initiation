If you go to AltaVista, Yahoo and others and look for web pages <BR>
about circumcision, you will have pages about religion (including <BR>
the very Christian Circumcision of the Christ) or pages about the <BR>
war done by some groups against routine infant circumcision. If <BR>
you try to find information about adult circumcision, you are <BR>
out of luck, I think this site is the only one on the net that <BR>
adresses specific problem of male aldult circ.<P>
On the pro/anti neo-natale circumcision, I am definitively <BR>
on the anti side. I strongly beleive that each human is <BR>
entitled to his/her own integrity and unless strong medical <BR>
reasons, something as definitive as circumcision should not <BR>
performed unless the person mostly interested could give his <BR>
accord. This is true for "civilian" routine circumcision but <BR>
for me it should be true even for Jews and Muslim. Pospone <BR>
the operation until he is capable to give his accord.<P>
So good, so well, so what happens to adults who have to make <BR>
a decision for themselves? No clues. If we compare various date<BR>
I have picked in this site, something like 8% of persons have ou<BR>
could have potential problem. At some extreme, a story from Germany<BR>
explained that in some school, the school physician recommended the<BR>
circumcision for 50% of the examined boys. If I understand well the<BR>
scope of the problem, if you are border line, the advice of the physician<BR>
will be more according his/her own beliefs than based on actual scientific<BR>
facts.

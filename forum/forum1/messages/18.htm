>I am a 26 year old male with an uncorected phimsosis since adolesence. I have a large overhang which I am not bothered about but I am also unable to retract my foreskin. I have never experienced any real problems with urination (apart from the requirement of a few extra shakes) so have never done anything about it.  However I recently awoke with a fully retracted trapped foreskin (the first ever)(must have been a good dream) and after about 10 mins of panic managed to pull it back over by squeezing the blood out of the glans.<BR>
>I never knew that I was different and am now developing quite a complex. I am a virgin for religious reason however I am due to be married next month and I am now quite concerned that I will not be able to have sex. I have previously tried to put a condom on with my penis hard, and of course the foreskin non retracted and it just slips off. I have tried to stretch the opening of my foreskin by inserting progresively large objects but it doesnt seem to be working and in any case I am concerned about the pressure that I seem to be exerting on the vain that goes right to the top of my foreskin. I have no visible opening but can get it to about 1.5cm when stretched. I think I am looking at surgery but do not really want to be fully circumcised also I do not want to visit my family GP are you aware of any clinics in the U.K where I can get the surgery I need.
  <P> I would agree mostly with Robin- I don't think you should try to "correct" 
    this before marriage in less than a month. Frankly, I doubt if you will have 
    very much difficulty having intercourse- especially if you utilize a good 
    personal lubricant like Astroglide. You should let her be a part of the time 
    when you are solving the issue. I cant understand why a condom would slip 
    off even if you do not retract before putting it on. if you leave some room 
    at the end for some movement- it would seem it should stay on. I did not have 
    paraphimosis but had a very tight foreskin due to frenulum breve - I did not 
    have that corrected until I was about your age- then just the frenulum was 
    trimmed away from the glans. I have found that the best way for me to stretch 
    is to slowly retract while hard- over the years I have been able to get mine 
    all the way back along the shaft with no problem. If those without a foreskin 
    can stretch enough to generate a simblance of one - those of us fortunate 
    enough to have one should be able to stretch over time if carful- even if 
    surgical intervention short of a full circ- you still need to keep it pliable. 
    I for one applaud you for wanting to retain one- I have found much joy in 
    having it.<BR>
    good luck </BLOCKQUOTE>

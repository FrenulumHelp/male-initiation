Hi Roxane.<P>
With regard to your question about penile growth.  I suffered from untreated phimosis until I was 26, and have suffered no ill effects as far as growth is concerned and I had adhesions to the head of my penis.<P>
The skin on the penis is pretty stretchy, and up until I was circumcised this was not one of my fears – although I had many others..<P>
I have discovered since being cut that I have experienced an increase in size, although that may be from the fact that I had surgery, or that I am now circumcised, rather than from the fact that I once had phimosis.<P>
Sometimes cleanliness is mentioned as a problem.  I had never seen the head of my penis until the day of my op., let alone clean it, so I never see this as too much of a problem – unless there are obvious signs of course.<P>
Previously it was mentioned that at 10, your sons phimosis is unlikely to go away on its own, I would agree with this, but I am sure that your son will be OK.  He is lucky that you are aware and that you will be able to guide him in the years to come.<P>
I didn’t find the experience of adult circumcision too bad – much more psychologically painful and a bit of a journey for me, so if this is the final outcome, then don’t worry.  You have already discovered many other options before reaching this stage.<P>
Hope this helps.<P>
Dave.

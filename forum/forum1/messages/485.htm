Hi.<P>
I recently found out about this frenulum. I've been aware of its existence for a long time but didn't know too much about it. Initially I thought it was nothing but a sinew which was for some reason holding my forehead back severely, I could pull the forehead over the head but there the frenulum kept it from rejecting any further. So I just simply tried to cut it loose with a razorblade but then, of course, it started bleeding heavily and I quickly aborted the operation. I am positive that I have frenulum breve and I must get the frenulum of the head. I am not yet sexually active but I will be very soon. Since I will probably increase my sexual adventures I must get the frenulum off the head before I make my sexual debut, I seriously want to avoid getting it ripped during sexual intercourse. I have a couple of questions,<P>
If I try a little harder, is it really possible for me to cut the frenulum off with a razorblade? <P>
I've heard about the "surgical" procedure. What does it really accomplish? Is the frenulum attached further down?  Can I completely remove the frenulum or is it a necessity? <P>
Can this operation be made on everyone, even though I have some veins rather close the frenulum? <P>
I would really appreciate answers and responses. <BR>
I am rather worried.<BR>
Thanks a lot!<BR>
Pete

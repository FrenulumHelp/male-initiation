I'm mystified by the statement, "I just use lube like a cut guy."  As a  (happily) cut guy with some years' experience, I've never had to use lube.  Of course, my lady friends have been pretty good at supplying plenty of natural lubricant, and my constantly-exposed glans may be tough enough to permit me to penetrate without any pain or problem (to either of us).  Just a comment in passing.  Cheers, RJK.<BR>
>>>I've never been bothered or upset about it.  I can wank with no problems and >>for penetrative sex I just use lube like a cut guy.  <BR>
>>You don't feel any pain at all ? .. example : especially if your partner is on<BR>
>>top ??<BR>
>No, not yet anyway.  Why would my partner's position make any difference?

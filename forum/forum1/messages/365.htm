>Hi Nick,<BR>
>Thanks for the piece you wrote - it's a really good account.  Just a quick question - what does the cream actually do to aid the whole process and did you massage the cream into the foreskin or just apply it and leave it be.  Again, thanks for the informative piece.<BR>
>Andy.<P>
No, I didnt really massage it into my foreskin. I just let it soak in for a few minutes. Thats all that seemed necessary. You could try it though I guess. <BR>
From what I hear, the creme thins the foreskin a bit. DONT let that scare you. It wont tear or anything like that.

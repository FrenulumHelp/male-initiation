As an answer to: <A HREF="270.htm">Sore after sex?</A> written by Sandra at 17 Feb 2000 22:11:02:
  <P> >Is an uncircumcised male supposed to be sore after sex, even if slightly? 
    My boyfriend is, and I think it is odd. He will not do anything about it.. 
    feedback, please?<BR>
    If he won't do anything about it, what's the point of feedback? If a need 
    for help isn't recognised, what might be called help by others may come across 
    as interference, and that I believe is not the purpose of this forum. Good 
    luck! Bob. </BLOCKQUOTE>

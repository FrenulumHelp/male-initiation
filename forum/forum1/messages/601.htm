Hello.<BR>
I went to see my doctor to ask him about my tight foreskin.  Although it completely retracts there's that tight and a little painful feeling at the frenulum area.<BR>
My doctor (without seeing my penis) thought it would be frenulum breve and sent me to the urologist.  The urologist turned to be an old man who thought my frenulum wasn't that tight,<BR>
and told me with normal sex practice it would eventually get looser, or rip.  I didn't like the idea, but went home and started daily stretching of the area.  After 2 months there was no visible gain in looseness, so<BR>
I went to the urologist again.  He seemed a little bit upset for seeing me again there, and he explained that frenulum is the anatomic male equivalent to female himen, and added that women don't complain about doctors not taking their hymen out before sex.<BR>
Well, that was the first time I ever heard something like that.  In fact, I had read that there is absolutely no relationship between the frenulum and the hymen, in the way that there's no male loss of virginity by the ripping of the frenulum.  Can anyone tell me who is right, and whether I should take a frenuloplasty?  Thanks a lot.  PS: If you respond, please send a copy of your message to bnt at europe.com.  Thanks again.

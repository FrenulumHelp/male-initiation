>Hi RS<P>
>Thanks for reading my post and helping me out.  I did take the time to read what u suggested  and do understand it a little better.<P>
>>>tight feeling that hurts. <BR>
>>>This really is pain.<BR>
>>When I hear this I feel it is a clear symptom of frenulum breve.<P>
>I do see the underneath skin connected to the head in opposite V, yes I'm sure <BR>
>I have the frenulum breve.<P>
>>now maybe you have a mixture of phimotic ring and frenulum breve, you need to check both.<BR>
>flaccid is there an hourglass effect around the shaft of the penis, which is the phimotic ring ...<P>
>During flaccid I do not see a hourglass effect around the shaft.<P>
>>So the question is, <BR>
>>when >can you see how the foreskin in the frenulum area under the glans is pulled in tight together. --- <P>
>hmm.. don't really understand the question (still very new to this)<BR>
>I am able to see the second skin which is the bottom (hidden) skin has the a part (v shape connected to the head)<P>
>Would have the V skin cutted be the answer? <BR>
>I do notice the hidden skin is very sensitive.<P>
>Thanks any other info u have would greatly appreciated.<BR>
>I check this board everyday <BR>
>Thanks again :)<BR>
> <P>
>>you can go to the welcome page again and read the abstracts and then follow the links for frenulum breve and phimosis - then the subsequent links for appropriate treatment are clearly linked at the page bottoms.<P>
>>Its not as bad as it sounds! - you probably dont need any sort of circumcision!<P>
>>Can you write to confirm or negate the frenulum idea and if there is a phimotic ring<P>
>>And please take a few days considering your position, it involves changes which you make for the rest of your life,
  <P> >>Good luck and happy hunting<BR>

    If you do have frenulum breve as I did- a very simple trimming of the frenulum 
    away from the glans will be of great help

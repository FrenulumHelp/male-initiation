  <P> Michael, as I said before I really believe a competent physician ought to 
    be able to get at your problem without undue difficulty. The tissue at the 
    bottom of the glans may well be adherent frenulum; if it is, the doctor should 
    be able to separate it gently from the glans without doing any neural damage. 
    If the cream works, it should relieve the phimosis within a few days/weeks; 
    if it doesn't, (as I said before!) a short dorsal snip should do the trick 
    with minimal trauma. It seems to me you need to find a competent physician 
    who is willing to act decisively and carefully. Good luck! Bob. <BR>

    >my situation. I should summarize by saying that I had been given a cream 
    containing .05% betamethasone that a urologist suggested that I try. He said 
    that I might very well experience a little tearing/bleeding as I try to pull 
    back the foreskin. This seemed a bit counter intuitive. I imagined some micro-scaring 
    could develop, partly defeating the objective of elastic stretching.<BR>

    So you begin to see we may have a catch-22 sort of dilema. Are, or is any 
    reader, aware of medical illustrations (clearly) showing the frenulum breve 
    or phimotic ring. It seems that the different specialists which I have seen 
    are<BR>
    >unfamilar with these terms. Thanks to all who read this for shedding light 
    on these and my previous (as yet)unanswered questions.<BR>
    >>Michael, it seems to me that you (and some of your midwestern urologist 
    friends) are making what is essentially a fairly simple problem into something 
    a lot more complicated than it needs to be. First off, your question about 
    zippers reminds me of a story that was told on a man in Atlanta some years 
    ago. He had married a Jewish lady and to please her had converted to her faith. 
    There were two posh clubs in Atlanta, one with gentile members only, the other 
    one with Jewish members only. The story was that at the time of his circumcision 
    he had a zipper installed so that he could zip on his foreskin when he went 
    to the gentile club, to which he already belonged, and zip it off when he 
    went to the Jewish club, which he joined after his conversion. I met him once 
    when he was quite old, but didn't ask him to confirm the story. (I seriously 
    doubt that it's true.)<BR>
    >> You ask about why the dorsal slit is where it is, and how it affects the 
    frenulum. Placed at the top of the penis as it is, the slit does not affect 
    the frenulum, which normally is located at the very bottom of the penis. You 
    ask about the slit's affect on appearance, etc. The slit need not be very 
    long as a rule, just long enough to relieve the tight foreskin so it can be 
    easily retracted. I know a man born in Washington State who had such a tiny 
    snippet made at the time of his birth. The result was that it was impossible 
    to tell him from any other uncircumcised man, but his foreskin was totally 
    free and easily retracted. Since you have lived 42 years without circumcision, 
    it might be a bit of a shock to you to do it at this time, but it seems highly 
    likely that a short dorsal slit could eliminate the tightness of the foreskin 
    without having any other perceptible effect. Certainly there's no point in 
    your putting up with uncomfortable sex any longer (and we haven't mentioned 
    your long-suffering wife's right to having a clean phallus thrust into her 
    vagina during sex!). If you can find a conservative, sympathetic physician 
    who isn't circumcision-happy but is willing to make a minimal slit at the 
    top of your penis, you may eliminate all your problems in short order. The 
    frenulum may not be involved at all; however, if it is found to be part of 
    the problem, the conservative, sympathetic physician should be able to snip 
    it with minimal trauma, followed by rapid recovery. Letters like yours make 
    me wonder at how much some men have to put up with, and at the questionable 
    help they sometimes receive from the medical profession. I wouldn't contact 
    the newspapers about this at all; at best they may think you're some kind 
    of nut instead of a citizen with a valid problem, which I accept that you 
    are. I suggest you keep looking for a competent doctor who is willing to help 
    you. There really are such people, and you can find one if you search diligently 
    and are lucky! Best wishes, Bob.<BR>

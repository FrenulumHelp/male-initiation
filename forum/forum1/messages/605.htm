MY RESPONSE<P>
I echo the other sentiments - lucky you.  I have known others that didn't naturally retract, or atrophy, until late teens or adulthood, and adjustment to the new sensation was not pleasant or easy.  Even at puberty it wasn't for me, and I had to work at it awhile to get used to it.  But I treasure the cut feel and look and think you are out of your mind to throw yours away.

>Another topical steroid cream that works for phimosis is .05% betamethasone.<BR>
>You should check out Nick's account of how this worked for him.<BR>
>Topical steroid creams are used standardly for everthing from mouth ulcers to diaper rash, but Nick (hope you don't mind me taking liberties with your name, Nick) and I have both seen that they work for phimosis as well.<P>
Dont worry about it ;)<P>
>The only down side is that the phimosis will recurr without regular continued retraction (a problem we encountered with my son who was only 8 when we used it, but certainly not a problem for any older male).<P>
no it isnt. I dont know a guy older than 14 who doesnt at least mastrabate. But you dont even need to do that. Just retract it when you pee.<P>
>Sometimes no amount of stretching will work (I have heard from quite a few men with this problem). <P>
it certainly DID NOT work for me. Thats why I went to my doctor.<BR>
his only recourse.<P>
>The dorsal slit may prove to be necessary at times, but why do it without trying this more conservative method first. It has a 90% success rate by the way.<P>
yes it does, but a lot of doctors dont know about it and insist circ is the only way.

>Hi, I'm 20 years old, and some days ago, I was with my girlfriend, It wasn't the first time. My frenulum ripped from the tissue that is attached to the urinal orifice. It bleeded too much, but don't hurt too much. It was three days ago, at this time it not hurts, but I don't know if this is normal or not. <BR>
>Any recommendation please?<P>
>Thanks and excuse me for my bad english!<P>
>PD: At this time I'm afrid to make love with her again (I mean in the near future)<P>
>Don't worry,Mine ripped too.<BR>
It has healed in a few days -you'll be able to make love in a week-<BR>
Now it's much better and I can pull the foreskin without any hurt.

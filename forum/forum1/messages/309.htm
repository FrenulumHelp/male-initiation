Gosh Laurent...I'm a female so I'm not much help here, maybe a man will answer you regarding the physical aspect of your question.  But, as a woman and a mom, maybe you should think about getting a different girlfriend.  It seems unreasonable to me that she would expect you to make your penis look circumcised. That's quite an expectation!  I'm sure you care for her very much, but maybe she needs to not worry so much about how your penis looks, but rather focus on her emotional feelings for you.<P>
Just my two cents...<BR>

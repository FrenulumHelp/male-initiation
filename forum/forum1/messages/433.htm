It seemed to me that your posting may be interpreted two different ways, as a result of the way you have worded it.<P>
Take your pick...<P>
1.  You are unable to pull your foreskin all the way *back* when erect (i.e. you have a tight foreskin).  If this is the case, you'll find tonnes of postings and URL links elsewhere in this forum relating to your condition.<P>
2. You are unable to pull your foreskin all the way *forward* over your head when erect (i.e. you have a short foreskin).  If this is the case, then your penis is perfectly normal and healthy, and absolutely no action is required on your part.  Indeed, you will probably be the envy of many boys/men who (unhappily) have much longer, infantile-looking foreskins.

    >Hi Everyone,<BR>
    >I'm 19 years old and have just visited the doctor.... then a consultant (3 
    month wait)<BR>
    >I seem to have a problem with my foreskin. When my penis is flacid I can 
    pull the foreskin over the head (managed this for the first time last week), 
    but when it is erect it only gets about half way.<BR>
    >The thing is, about year ago I realised that the foreskin actually has to 
    come back over the head. (I knew mine was different but didn't realise it 
    would effect sex)<BR>
    >I have been masterbating for years and have had a couple of drunken sexual 
    experiences, but over the past year I have been scared to go out with women, 
    incase I can not actually have sex. Can I have PROPER sex even though my foreskin 
    doesn't go over the head?<BR>
    >Anyway after the consultant examined me, he said the penis was "perfectly 
    alright and foreskin was normal". But it feels really tight!<BR>
    >So saying that I'm a late starter in getting my foreskin completely over, 
    can anyone give me some tips (eg should I use cream???)<BR>
    >Please help

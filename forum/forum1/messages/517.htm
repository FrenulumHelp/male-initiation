As an answer to: <A HREF="515.htm">Re:  Dorsal Slit for Phimotic Ring with Frenulum Breve and Veins</A> written by R J Knight at 22 Jul 2000 20:02:40:<P>
Thank you for your response R.J.  Sorry if I seem to have overly complicated<BR>
my situation. I should summarize by saying that I had been given a cream containing .05% betamethasone that a urologist suggested that I try. He said that I might very well experience a little tearing/bleeding as I try to pull back the foreskin. This seemed a bit counter intuitive. I imagined some micro-scaring could develop, partly defeating the objective of elastic stretching.<BR>
I'd go along with the have pain - get gains philosophy if it wasn't for this<BR>
ridge of tissue at the tip of the underside of the glans. I am guessing that<BR>
this is part of the frenulum with its point of attachment way too far up the <BR>
glans than it should be. So basically I feel if I trying the foreskin pullback<BR>
methods too earnestly, then I am going to quickly tear at the frenulum. My primary question really is how can urologist/surgeon can make the least invasive cuts into both the phimotic tissue and the frenulum, so that desired<BR>
pleasure nerve function and vascular blood flow levels are maintained in that area. In this connection I was surprised that a second urologist which I consulted ( he's smart enough to have taught at a med school) was not familiar<BR>
with any way to inspect the tissue involvement without pulling back the foreskin. So you begin to see we may have a catch-22 sort of dilema. Are, or is any reader, aware of medical illustrations (clearly) showing the frenulum breve or phimotic ring. It seems that the different specialists which I have seen are<BR>
unfamilar with these terms. Thanks to all who read this for shedding light on these and my previous (as yet)unanswered questions.<BR>
>Michael, it seems to me that you (and some of your midwestern urologist friends) are making what is essentially a fairly simple problem into something a lot more complicated than it needs to be.  First off, your question about zippers reminds me of a story that was told on a man in Atlanta some years ago.  He had married a Jewish lady and to please her had converted to her faith.  There were two posh clubs in Atlanta, one with gentile members only, the other one with Jewish members only.  The story was that at the time of his circumcision he had a zipper installed so that he could zip on his foreskin when he went to the gentile club, to which he already belonged, and zip it off when he went to the Jewish club, which he joined after his conversion.  I met him once when he was quite old, but didn't ask him to confirm the story. (I seriously doubt that it's true.)<BR>
>     You ask about why the dorsal slit is where it is, and how it affects the frenulum.  Placed at the top of the penis as it is, the slit does not affect the frenulum, which normally is located at the very bottom of the penis.  You ask about the slit's affect on appearance, etc.  The slit need not be very long as a rule, just long enough to relieve the tight foreskin so it can be easily retracted. I know a man born in Washington State who had such a tiny snippet made at the time of his birth.  The result was that it was impossible to tell him from any other uncircumcised man, but his foreskin was totally free and easily retracted.  Since you have lived 42 years without circumcision, it might be a bit of a shock to you to do it at this time, but it seems highly likely that a short dorsal slit could eliminate the tightness of the foreskin without having any other perceptible effect.  Certainly there's no point in your putting up with uncomfortable sex any longer (and we haven't mentioned your long-suffering wife's right to having a clean phallus thrust into her vagina during sex!).  If you can find a conservative, sympathetic physician who isn't circumcision-happy but is willing to make a minimal slit at the top of your penis, you may eliminate all your problems in short order.  The frenulum may not be involved at all; however, if it is found to be part of the problem, the conservative, sympathetic physician should be able to snip it with minimal trauma, followed by rapid recovery.  Letters like yours make me wonder at how much some men have to put up with, and at the questionable help they sometimes receive from the medical profession.  I wouldn't contact the newspapers about this at all; at best they may think you're some kind of nut instead of a citizen with a valid problem, which I accept that you are. I suggest you keep looking for a competent doctor who is willing to help you. There really are such people, and you can find one if you search diligently and are lucky!  Best wishes, Bob.<BR>

&gt;&gt;Michael, it seems to me that you (and some of your midwestern urologist friends) are making what is essentially a fairly simple problem into something a lot more complicated than it needs to be.  First off, your question about zippers reminds me of a story that was told on a man in Atlanta some years ago.  He had married a Jewish lady and to please her had converted to her faith.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I've pretty much read all the previous conversations and am trying to put it

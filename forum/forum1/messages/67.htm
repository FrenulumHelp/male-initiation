hello again Steve,<P>
thanks for the (small easy to download) jpeg<P>
Interesting - you have a partial phimosis but also you have a curious frenulum which gathers in all the inner foreskin really close under the glans, - You can see if the prominent frenular ridge was cut just behind the glans, then the inner foreskin here would loosen out, <P>
So you definately need a frenuloplasty ... frenoplasty ... (is also used and at least the name is shorter) ... for the partial phimosis I`d still suggest partial circ.  but I received this today referring to Cuckow who is an expert in such matters<P>
Dr P M. Cuckow:<BR>
Hospital: Dept of  Paediatric Urology, Great Ormond Street Hospital, London<BR>
WC1N 3JH.<P>
Cuckow was very<BR>
informative and, as you say, thoughtful.  He said full circ was the most<BR>
guaranteed to heal with no problems but has done what he called a limited<BR>
circ and advised "........" on the importance of retracting the foreskin<BR>
regularly straight away.  ie not waiting until it feels better enough.  He<BR>
says the chances of the partial circ closing again are high and regularly<BR>
stretching the wound is the way to prevent this. <P>
----------------------------<P>
the guy on<BR>
  <A HREF="../../../circumcision/partial_circumcision.html#start">http://www.male-initiation.net/partial_circ.html</A><BR>
said no stretching was necessary in his case<BR>
and I`ve written to him for the address of his NHS doctor<P>
partial circ. was the original Jewish cut, we could imagine it was the original traditional cut, simply because to perform it is easier, requiring at most for equipment only a clamp to trap the glans inside the foreskin to avoid cutting the glans, ... it seems in recent years the pro circers of this world have invented any number of clever little gadgets to facilitate a full circ. .. partials are hardly ever performed ...<P>
Please ring round a few hospitals and doctors and give feedback <P>

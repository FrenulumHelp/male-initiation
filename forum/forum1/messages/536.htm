Written by WORRIED dude at 30 Jul 2000 07:12:06:<P>
     I have some serious concerns! I know there are a lot of foreskin comments here, and I have a concern about my tight foreskin.  Well at first it was very tight, but over the years I have been stretching it out and I used a cream for a while.  Now I can pull it all the way back when limp, but when erect I can only pull it back partially and it is painful.  My concern is that somewhere i read that there are thousands of very sensitive nerve endings on the foreskin which <BR>
enhance sex (making it much better for the uncircumcised man versus the circumcised).  I am worried that by continually stretching it when it hurts I might damage these nerve endings (there are little tiny white spots (not smegma)that look like they might be nerve endings) and decrease my future sexual pleasure.<BR>
    This is related to my other concerns.  I am 19 year old virgin, itching to have sex. A few months ago I got involved with a girl who offered me sex on 4 occassions, but alas, I could not get an erection!  Granted, 3 of these times i was either drunk or stoned, but the 4th time i was totally sober and I still couldn't get an erection, even after looking at porno!  I wanted to crawl in a hole and die, cuz i'm 19 and couldn't get it up.  But I talked to a doctor who said that since i regularly masturbate there can be nothing wrong with my penis, and I am not gay.  Could it just be nervousness about losing my virginity????  <BR>
    Anyways, I thought maybe it was related to my foreskin, because the fact that I can't pull it back all the way means that maybe i can't get an erection without lots of direct pressure (i.e. masturbation) because the sensitive glans is covered. I mean, can I even have sex or get a decent blowjob when I can't pull my foreskin all the way back???  Last time I tried to pull it back for a blowjob, the blowjob hurt like hell!!!  Will sex hurt?  Should I keep forcing the skin back? will I damage nerves???? <BR>
   I need advice urgently because in a week this girl is coming to visit me and going to give me another opportunity to have sex.  If I fail to get an erection this time i will need to crawl in a hole and die.  What should I do???  I am so worried.  If u reply, any medical studies or medical sites which can back up what u say would be greatly appreciated.  Thank u my fellow men!

>I am now 67 and was born at a time when I believe that routine circumcision was very common.  I often wonder why I was not routinely circumcised shortly after birth.  Shortly after our son was born the Doctor asked my wife if she wished to have him circumcised.  No information was given to guide us in our decision and we decided against it.  Some years ago I considered having circumcision done with a private operation but the cost of the operation decided me against it.  I have recently have had tests for diabetes with negative results and there is no obvious medical reason for having it done but I have often wondered what the effects would have been on sexual intercourse if I had had the operation done. <BR>

I`m not competent in answering the finenesses for or against circumcision when there is no physiological medical necessity for the operation. As far as I`m concerned to decide between only these two extreme options (of full circ. or nothing at all) is a crazy question. ... consider partial circs, or any number of plastic alterations. <P>
Please refer to the rather confusing eternal debate on the subject in alt.circumcsiion NG. or visit the hundreds of anti and poro circumcsiioin sites on-line.<P>
Thanks<BR>

This happened to me as well.<P>
Sorry, it is too late now.  It can only be stitched back within the first few hours after it happened.  Anything after that, blood vessels would die off and shut down the blood supply.  That's why you are still living, and not bleed to death.<P>
You don't have to see a doctor now since he/she would not be able to do anything to you anyway, unless there is apparent infection around the wound, or your sex life is hindered, ie sore or pain when excited/erected.<P>
One point I want to make.  I know it is embarrassing to tell anyone including doctors about what happened to you, but they honestly don't care.  They got so many patients a day that they don't have to time to give you funny look or ask you embarrassing questions. They just get on with it. Just like when you buy condoms in the supermarkets, the checkout lady would just put it through the till.  <P>
I went to the hospital on my own by taxi.  Arrived the hospital, and told the receptionist what happened, and she told me to take a seat, and you will be seen shortly.<P>
When I was being seen, by 3 doctors in fact, the A&E doctor, then the urologist, and then the surgeon, and they dealt with it in a very professional way.  <P>

>Can i just leave it, will it heal back together? and there is a small piece of >skin sticking out (because of the rip the part right below my hole on the tip)>will this skin die off, or will it rejoin with the bottom part?  PLEASE tell <BR>
>me?  I need to know  asap!  THANKS<P>
Now, you just have to leave it, there is nothing can be done now, it won't heal back, it won't fall off, it won't rejoin.  Sorry.  You must have seeked medical attention immediately after it happened if you wanted it stitched back

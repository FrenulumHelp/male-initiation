Thanks for your answer...<P>
Since I posted, I have done heaps of reading and heaps of handds-on research, and I am quite certain that frenulum breve is not the problem.<P>
Something is too tight, I'm not yet certain whether the something is his foreskin, or me, but we are experimenting with diferent types of foreplay to stretch me before penetration, using lots of lubricant and he is doing gentle stretching of his foreskin in the shower...<P>
He is not willing to go to the doctor, so I am glad the problem is as slight as it is. <P>
If the problem *does* turn out to be his foreskin, and not me, and a cortizone cream is neccessary to assist in stretching, what strengths are best to use? I regularly have cortisone creams prescribed for exema on my hands, and would  be glad if I could just get an extra tube.<P>
Thanks for your intrest, <BR>
Sarah

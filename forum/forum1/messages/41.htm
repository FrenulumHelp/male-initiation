>Hi Steve<P>
>The only form of phimosis which you need worry about is a phimotic ring, aparrently from your descriptions you have none. What I suspect is that your frenulum is of the type which branches out like the roots of a tree, and your tree roots are too short, and this is causing the narrowed opening ... you need pruning ... <P>
>I believe what you describe is what you see always: the effect of the foreskin which wont retract, - I`m pretty sure the cause of this is the frenulum, <P>
>Your descriptions are too vague for me to be 100% sure that you haven`t any trace of phimosis, ... but if underneath the glans, the outer foreskin is connected right up front to the glans then this is something clearly not normal, and I still hold to my advice that the frenulum is the main problem and if you get this fixed then you`ll be able to see if you`ve any phimosis.<P>
<BR>
When my penis is limp my foreskin over hangs the end of my penis by about 1cm and it seriously smaller than the rest of my penis - I can't even stretch the end of it anywhere near as wide as the rest of my penis<P>

  <P>
I have read them but I still can't relate them to my penis exactly - the neares thing it sounds like is the infant phoimosis and certainly my penis has always looked like it does now (well its bigger - but the tubular form has always been there)<P>
>You said you wouldn`t mind going private, hummm well Dr. Cuckow in London must be the expert but we`re talking about &1,200 for an op. or &125 for a consultation, now what I`m thinking is it might be worth a consultation for you to get my diagnosis confirmed, ... (or naturally rejected?)<P>
*gulps*<P>
>I can guarantee with a partial circ. your problem would still remain, maybe on the other hand you`d like a partial circ. but that is purely a cosmetic question ...<P>
The first of the two pages you refer to talks about a frenuloplasty - which I assume would resolve the frenulum breve but not the phimosis (if I do indeed have it). Is it possible to combine a frenuloplasty  with a partial circ or are they mutually exclusive?<P>

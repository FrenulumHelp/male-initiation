  <P> I had a problem with my frenullum(however its spelt!).<BR>
    A month ago, i had painful sex but i got used to it and carried on. When wefinished 
    i wen to clean up and i noticed my genital area was covered in....blood! I 
    rushed to the batroom ands it was very apinful but saw no sign where the blood 
    was from. I had realised that piece of skin had torn, and now after 3 weeks 
    all is well. It is no longer painfull and can be pulled back with ease. I 
    had very painful times with this, so id be happy to help others in the similar 
    situation. Gaz

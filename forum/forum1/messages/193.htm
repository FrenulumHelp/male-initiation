As an answer to: <A HREF="188.htm">Unable to retract foreskin Fully</A> written by Ra at 07 Jan 2000 16:08:24:<P>
The topical steroid creams are very effective.<BR>
We only had to use the one prescribed for my son (Kenalog 0.1%) for a couple of weeks before his foreskin became fully retractable.<BR>
I hope you will also have success with it
  <P> >i am 20 years old and live in india , ever since i can remember i was unable 
    to fully retract my foreskin beyond a level where i could just see the tip 
    of the penis, i have no trouble mastrubating or neither do i have any trouble 
    in my daily affairs , now i realize that this will pose a major problem when 
    i have intercourse , when forcing the foreskin to move back i feel pain and 
    let go , i do not want to go for a circumsicion and am ready to try anything 
    else . please advice and help .

As an answer to: <A HREF="576.htm">CAN SOMEONE PLEASE HELP ME!!!!!</A> written by ADAM at 10 Aug 2000 20:15:52:<P>
I had a similar little lump ON my frenulum for several years. It went away of its own accord. Think it was just a tiny cyst. I wouldn't worry, unless they grow or become tender.
  <P> >I am 18 and I appear to have two small yellow spots, one either side of 
    the base of the frenulum near the glans. They are not painful, but are causing 
    me some concern as i am unsure as to whether they are normal? Please can someone 
    advise me as to what they may be?<BR>
    >Many thanks

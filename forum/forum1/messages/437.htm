I'm 16 and I have phimosis too.  I had sex for the first time last week, but using a condom so that it was not painful.  The retraction of your foreskin may be due to the fact of having "rough sex".  To minimise the chances of this happening again I would use a fair amount of lubricant during intercourse, and so to ease the pain.  Also, try to wear a condom as much as possible of you do not want any pain at all.  If this has not solved the problem then I would suggest you go and see your doctor or urologist and he/she should give you some advice on this matter.<P>
Good luck, Andrew!.

Well, I've just discovered the web site - I won't tell you what I asked Yahoo to search for - and I've found out what the problem is!<P>
A few years back I had the symptoms of LSA - small white scar like nodules (how else to describe them!) and now Phimosis. I now know what they both are, after months of pondering (not worrying really, its easier to just ignore it after all!).<P>
So I'm going to the doctor!!<P>
A couple of questions tho.<P>
1)<BR>
Has anyone got any observations on their ability to maintain a full erection and reach orgasm with Philmosis?<P>
I'm finding sex lasts longer, but I don't feel fully hard.<P>
2) Although the ring feels sore all the way around, its most sore where its attached on the underside. I regularly get broken blood vessels, sometimes large.<P>
3)<BR>
PArtial circumcision?...ouch??<P>
Once again, the site is brilliant - enough to restore my faith in the web!<P>
Happy New Year<BR>

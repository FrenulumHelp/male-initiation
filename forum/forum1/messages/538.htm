I have a similar problem where it's unbearable to pull back the foreskin due to the pain, and I've been offered two options, the slight "slit" cut, or circumcision. From what I hear, the dorsal slit looks fairly bad, while circumcision at least looks constant all around (rather than an obvious cut in the foreskin).

Hello Todd<P>
I dont want to insult the local doctor, who inevitably never had any special training in the area, and generally speaking cant perform miracles, <P>
you remember the phimosis treatment link which I gave you when we were talking about secondary phimosis<BR>
    <A HREF="../../../phimosis_treatment.html#start">http://www.male-initiation.net/phimosis_treatment.html</A><BR>
what I feel now you should check out all the subsequent links<P>
At some point you will need to go to a doctor, but first I`d suggest spending a few days getting to understand your condition better. You need to check if you have a phimotic ring, and as you follow the thinking through, a secondary ring will need some sort of operation ... this could be a partial circ or there are naturally other alternatives ... a little time spent understanding the subject would make it worth a doctor discussing this with you in an intelligent manner, instead of simply prescribing an operation which you dont understand.<P>

>Thanks once again,    Todd.<P>
a urologist would be better, but even here the main suggested treatment will be full circumcision, ... if you`re happy with this idea, then fine but otherwise doctors are quite human and you can discuss with them the reason you may not want a full circumcision, <BR>
I feel it`s worth you understanding your condition before you go to a consultation<P>
Good luck and happy hunting<BR>

I sympathise with you very much, as that is just the situation I was in at your age. I eventually got circumcised, but I would have preferred to have kept my foreskin if I could have got it loosened.<P>
Your best hope would appear to be either steroid cream or minor surgery (a dorsal slit or partial circ.).  I can't speak from experience of these, but there may be others on this forum who may be able to give views of these options.<P>
Otherwise, you have the choice of leaving your foreskin as it is (but only if it doesn't cause pain during intercourse) or having a full circ like me.<P>
Best wishes<BR>

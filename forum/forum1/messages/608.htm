As an answer to: <A HREF="464.htm">Help with stretching a tight foreskin</A> written by Mark at 04 Jul 2000 14:15:11:<P>
>I have phimosis, and have done all my life, but since I was about 18 I've been able to retract the skin fully when flaccid.  I can almost retract the skin when erect too, but I need to stretch it just a bit more.  Is there any non-prescription cream or lotion I can use to help with this?
  <P> MR RESPONSE: Good advice from Joshua. Also see foreskin.org/pin.htm for 
    help stretching it.

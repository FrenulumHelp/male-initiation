Sounds as if you have a congenital condition called epispadias, and you would be well advised to go to a doctor who can have a look at it.  On occasion they do plastic surgery to sew the slit up and restore the glans to a more or less normal-looking condition. If you are able to get an erection with your glans as it is, you may be able to have normal sex, but I still think it is highly advisable for you to go have a doctor (or more than one doctor, possibly a plastic surgeon)take a look at it and advise you where to go from here.  Best wishes, RJK.  <BR>
>wondering if anyone has the same problem i do.  i have no problem retracting my foreskin but my penis head is a little different.  instead of just having a hole at the tip mine actually is more like a slit from the tip to the back of the head.  will this give me any problems during sex?

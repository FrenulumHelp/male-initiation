Written by Sarah at 22 Feb 2000 13:08:02:<P>
My lover was 18 and a virgin when we started having sex.<P>
The first time we had sex we used a condom and sex painful for him, and he found achieving orgasm difficult.<BR>
Since his penis is quite large, we assumed the condom was too tight, and purchased some larger ones. <P>
This helped alieviate the problem, but did not completely remove it.<P>
Recently, after I recieved my all clear on STD testing, we started having sex without condoms, expecting that all pain and difficulty with achieving orgasm would cease.<P>
Unfortuneately, this was not the case.<P>
He experiences pain on entry, strong enough to make him wince and hiss, but not<BR>
enough to make him want to stop. Once he has entered fully, there is not more pain, but orgasm is often delayed and sometimes simply does not happen. This is<BR>
frustrating and distressing for us both.<P>
I remarked casually that I felt perhaps his foreskin was too tight (although he has never had any discomfort when masturbating), and he said he tended to agree. <BR>
I mentioned that gentle stretching in the shower could sometimes help with the<BR>
problem, and he said he would try.<P>
I am still concerned, however, as he has mentioned that his mother once told him<BR>
that he had some penile problem as an infant (but did not specify what the problem had been).<P>
I have also noticed that the seam or raphe that runs the length of his shaft is broken and distorted from the top of the scrotum to about 2 or 3 inches up his shaft.<P>
I am curious as to the nature of his problem, for until we know what precicely it is, we cannot really find a solution.<P>
Hoping someone will have some ideas that can help us.<P>

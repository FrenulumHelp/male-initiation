At some point you will need to go to a doctor, but first I`d suggest spending a few days getting to understand the condition better. You need to check if your son has a phimotic ring, .. a little time spent understanding the subject would make it worth a doctor discussing this with you in an intelligent manner, instead of simply prescribing an operation which you dont understand.<P>
you can go to the welcome page again and read the abstracts and then follow the links for phimosis - or go direct to

There`s a couple of very rational reasons not to be circumcised which you could discuss with any doctor: the lack of lubrication seems the best of these<BR>

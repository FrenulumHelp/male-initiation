>>>Why is it that no matter how much time and effort I put into washing my penis in the shower,(keeping the foreskin pulled back) I still get that awful whiff of a rancid smell whenever I pull my foreskin back throughout the day, or even right after a shower.  This problem isn't great for my love life.  Have any of you fellow uncut guys found a way to really keep yourselves clean and smelling good without having to resort to circumcision?<BR>
>>* * *<BR>
>>Yes!  Here is THE solution, and I can personally say that it works.  Permanent foreskin retraction achieves ALL of the benefits of circumcision with NONE of the other effects.  Depending upon how tight or loose your foreskin is and how sensitive the head, you may find this to be easy or difficult.  Mine was loose and would not stay, and took considerable effort on my part until penis growth, especially the size of the head, kept it back more often and finally all the time.  Fortunately I hadn't finished puberty and growth yet.  In adults, Im sure it would be more difficult.  Take a look at circlist.org/cfeelcut.html for help.  Bacteria that breed in the swamp under the unretracted foreskin multiply so quickly that it becomes a full time job keeping it clean if you don't get the penis out in the open so it can breathe and dry out.  I did read a comment from one guy about using baby powder under there, but that can interfere with some kinds of sex and would still require constant application for the rest of your life.  Go for the retraction.  It is harmless, painless, costless and reversable, as another guy like me likes to say.  At the very worst, it only makes circumcision easier if that becomes your last resort.  At best, you will be forever clean and ready for any impromptu encounter, and may even come to prefer the look and feel.  I do.<BR>
>I totally agree with the above remarks.  Permanent retraction does the job, with no disadvantages such as removal of the foreskin, which some people prize highly.  (It does have a lot of nerve endings that must contribute to sexual pleasure, although some folks debate this.)  Retraction has a long history.  Millions of American men born before circumcision became common here after 1945 kept their foreskins retracted, according to some published reports in medical journals of the early 1950s.<BR>
>The best results come from total retraction, as the letter above points out,<BR>
>but if you have a long, loose foreskin that won't cooperate, you can definitely train it to stay rolled up behind the glans so it keeps the glans bare and dry at all times.  It may not want to stay rolled up at first, but you can keep it in the position you want with adhesive tape; after a couple of days it should stay neatly rolled up behind the bare glans.  This makes for a much cleaner penis than one with a long foreskin, but of course you still have to clean under the rolled-up skin every time you shower.  Because you have had a lot of trouble with bacteria, you may still have some problems under the rolled-up skin, although most guys who've done this don't seem to, possibly because no urine passes under the roll of skin to keep that area wet & friendly to bacteria. If neither of these approaches work you can always try circumcision or dorsal slit, & either of these should dry out the bacteria and stop the stink, but because of the ease and minimal trauma of retraction, you may want to try it before anything else.  Good luck!  RJK.<P>

Any suggestions, my foreskins hangs over about 1.5" when I'm erect...it's very loose (from stretching it when I was going through puberty), and no matter how often I wash, I always seem to have that musky odor.  It is especially bad after I've had sex with my girlfriend (I don't use a condom...it never stays on...too much foreskin).  I do try to keep myself clean, when ever I shower, I always take great care to skin myself back and forth and use lots of soap.  I always end up getting erect too.

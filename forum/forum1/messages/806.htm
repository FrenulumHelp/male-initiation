>When we are having sex, my boyfriend sometimes has pain or bleeds from the underside of the head (where the V is I think, he won't let me see).  He also sometimes has problems inserting as the foreskin is being pulled backwards and the bit under the head stretches/hurts.<BR>
>What is the problem and is there anyway to solve it rather than going to the doctor - it's kind of a touchy/embarassing subject for him, something abou this manliness being questioned so I have to be tactful.<BR>
>Also, he sometimes smells a bit fishy/yucky under the foreskin as I think it doesn't go all the way back (is there meant to be a fold still or when you pull back is it meant to look smooth?) What can I tactfully suggest especially if it is a movement problem of the foreskin.  BTW there is no visible substance.<BR>
>Thanks!!<P>
The fishy/yucky smell is due to bacteria that grow in the warm moist area under the foreskin.  You can wash with soap and water, of course, but it is difficult to  control them unless the area can be kept dry, as it is after circumcision or permanent retraction of the foreskin.<P>
So far as the bleeding problem is concerned, if he will let you, you might be able to help by gently stretching the foreskin after you apply sweet oil under it, and by trying to pull it back enough to completely loosen the frenulum and free the foreskin to totally uncover the glans.  The fact that it bleeds when he has sex indicates that there are adhesions that haven't come loose and are being torn by the in-and-out movements of sexual activity.  If you can get him to allow you to handle him gently as a part of pre-sexual foreplay (as some couples customarily do) you may be able to help him get over the problem.  However, if all else fails and it continues to interfere with your enjoyment of sex, you ought to drag him, kicking  screaming if he insists, to a doctor who can (without much question) put a stop to the problem in a hurry with a minimum of pain.  By the way, it's no more a reflection on his manliness to see a doctor for a problem in this area than it would be to see one for a sore throat that doesn't heal.  Lots of luck, RJK.

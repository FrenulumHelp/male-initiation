As an answer to: <A HREF="662.htm">Wanking can sure phimosis</A> written by timber at 18 Sep 2000 01:42:29:
  <P> This has been known for decades, but this article sets it all out - quite 
    well, too. The only thing you have to ask is why an examination of a boy's 
    foreskin is part of a college medical? Do uncut boys have bigger brains? No, 
    its because doctors are fascinated - and usually envious - of foreskins! </BLOCKQUOTE>

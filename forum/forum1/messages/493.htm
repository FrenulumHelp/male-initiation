As an answer to: <A HREF="482.htm">BXO</A> written by DC at 10 Jul 2000 22:59:05:<P>
BXO has been successfully treated with a powerful steroid cream. For more info, see:<BR>

  <P> >My little brother has just been 'diagnosed' by our local doctor as having 
    Balanitis Xerotica Obliterans (BXO). My brother's penis has had a few small 
    cuts on the foreskin on a couple of occasions in the past and although they 
    have now healed he cannot pull his foreskin back at all. The doctor just looked 
    at his penis and said he would bet that it was BXO, implying that he may not 
    have been sure. He also said that the only treatment is circumcision. Now 
    what we want to know is what exactly is BXO? What causes it? Can it be treated 
    without circumcision, with a cream for example? Please help!</BLOCKQUOTE>

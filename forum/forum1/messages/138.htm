Hello Chris,<P>
Sorry but I doubt if anyone on this group has any idea about such "medical" problems. An uncomfortable individual "fate" you have, however I imagine your problem is fairly easy for an Urologist (or maybe even a normal doctor) to help you understand and possibly cure.
  <P> good luck<BR>

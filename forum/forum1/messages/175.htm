Hi Everyone,<P>
I'm 19 years old and have just visited the doctor.... then a consultant (3 month wait)<P>
I seem to have a problem with my foreskin.  When my penis is flacid  I can pull the foreskin over the head (managed this for the first time last week), but when it is erect it only gets about half way.<P>
The thing is, about year ago I realised that the foreskin actually has to come back over the head. (I knew mine was different but didn't realise it would effect sex)<P>
I have been masterbating for years and have had a couple of drunken sexual experiences, but over the past year I have been scared to go out with women, incase I can not actually have sex.  Can I have PROPER sex even though my foreskin doesn't go over the head?<P>
Anyway after the consultant examined me, he said the penis was "perfectly alright and foreskin was normal".  But it feels really tight!<P>
So saying that I'm a late starter in getting my foreskin completely over, can anyone give me some tips (eg should I use cream???)<P>
Please help

You are 22 and nobody can make you submit to circumcision or any other medical treatment.<P>
Your condition is common among uncircumcised, and is called phimosis.  When the foreskin is retracted and stuck, it is called paraphimosis.  Because you are able to fully retract it, at least when flaccid, means that you do not have adhesions or other problem, and the phimosis is not as severe as in some cases.  Therefore, you may be able to cure it by simple stretching, to make the opening wider at the tip.  If you look down the page, you can find plenty of others with this problem, and ways to stretch using your fingers inserted at the opening.  You may get a doctor to prescribe a cortico-steroid cream that helps this.

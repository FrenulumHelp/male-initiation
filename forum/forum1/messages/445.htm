As an answer to: <A HREF="443.htm">pulling foreskin down</A> written by Rich at 05 Jun 2000 01:17:33:<P>
I wouldn't rush anything.  If you aren't able to slip your foreskin back comfortably when soft and not able to retract when stiff, then I would wait some more before I tried.  When you do skin yourself right back, don't leave your foreskin back very long.  If you become erect and the skin is back, it will probably get caught there.  No matter if you know what to do or not, that isn't a situation to be taken lightly at all.  If you're still feeling pain, then you aren't ready to go over the rim on your knob.<P>
As far as the smegma goes, it's a naturally occuring substance.  I wouldn't worry about it, especially if it's helping the skin slip back.  When you do begin to clean yourself though, only wash with clear water, no soap, as that will really irritate your foreskin and make problems.

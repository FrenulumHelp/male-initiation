As an answer to: <A HREF="519.htm">Long Foreskin</A> written by David at 25 Jul 2000 16:07:00:
  <P> Looks as if you're one of the guys who would be helped by circumcision, 
    not necessarily a radical one: your foreskin is getting in the way of having 
    sex and making it difficult for you to feel what your penis is doing. If the 
    opening of your foreskin is tight enough to keep it back behind the glans 
    when you retract it, then you might do well just to keep it retracted all 
    the time. That way about half of the glans would stay permanently exposed 
    and you could get it all exposed inside the vagina during sex. (One TV star 
    of the past who posed nude for a centerfold kept his penis this way.) If the 
    opening is so loose that your foreskin won't stay back at all when retracted, 
    there doesn't seem to be much you can do short of circumcision. There are 
    a number of kinds of circumcision which your doctor can use if willing to 
    do so: cut high, leaving everything exposed, cut low, leaving considerable 
    foreskin at the base of the glans but leaving the glans itself exposed, and 
    one that might be good for you to use, cutting away mostly external foreskin 
    and keeping most of the internal foreskin (mucosa), stitching it to the shaft 
    so it replaces the external foreskin when it heals. That way many nerves in 
    the interior foreskin are kept unharmed and you probably would have much more 
    satisfying sex than you can have at present. Another thing you might try without 
    resorting to circumcision is to push the foreskin back as far as it will go, 
    then fold the foreskin inward on itself and roll up as much of it as possible 
    behind the glans, to leave some of the glans exposed. However, as long as 
    your foreskin is, I doubt that this approach would help much. In Europe when 
    they wanted to preserve the appearance of an uncircumcised penis, they have 
    sometimes resorted to removing some of the long, redundant foreskin, then 
    stitching what is left together so that it appears uncircumcised but is short 
    enough to manage without problems during sex. I think it's important for you 
    to find a urologist, if you can, who's had some experience with foreskin problems 
    and is willing to work this one out with you. Best wishes, RJK. <BR>
    >I am a young guy with a very long foreskin, I have a inch and a half overhang 
    when soft and half a inch overhang when hard. Though my foreskin slides back 
    very easy, I find when having sex after a few thrusts it slips forward over 
    the glans and I don't get much stimulation and it is very hard to cum. I also 
    find wearing a condom impossible as it slides forward with the foreskin and 
    quiet often breaks. Do any other guys have this problem and is there any way 
    of shorting my foreskin. I don't want to get circumcised.

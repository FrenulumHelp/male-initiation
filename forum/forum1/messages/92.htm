Hello Huey,<P>
If you want to avoid circumcision then you need a couple of hours learning about the subject and reading through the relevant pages, ... I suggest you go back to the Welcome page and pick up the ZIP at the bottom of the page<BR>
<A HREF="../../../welcome.html#start">www.male-initiation.net</A><P>
The important point about making a self diagnosis is that YOU feel confident that you understand what`s happening anatomically, to be able to make it worth a doctor discussing this with you in an intelligent manner, instead of simply prescribing an operation which you dont understand.<P>
>tight feeling that hurts. <BR>
>This really is pain.<BR>
When I hear this I feel it is a clear symptom of frenulum breve.<P>
now maybe you have a mixture of phimotic ring and frenulum breve, you need to check both.<P>
So the question is, <BR>
when flaccid is there an hourglass effect around the shaft of the penis, which is the phimotic ring ...<BR>
can you see how the foreskin in the frenulum area under the glans is pulled in tight together. --- <P>
you can go to the welcome page again and read the abstracts and then follow the links for frenulum breve and phimosis - then the subsequent links for appropriate treatment are clearly linked at the page bottoms.<P>
Its not as bad as it sounds! - you probably dont need any sort of circumcision!<P>
Can you write to confirm or negate the frenulum idea and if there is a phimotic ring<P>
And please take a few days considering your position, it involves changes which you make for the rest of your life,<P>
Good luck and happy hunting<BR>
Robin<BR>

  <P> Hi Ed,<BR>
    I will send you all websites dealing with this as soon as I have found them 
    again. Also, I have invited someone who has used the steroid cream successfully 
    <BR>
    to join this forum. Hopefully we'll be hearing from him soon. I have found 
    him very helpful and reassuring.<BR>
    Surely, if you go to your doctor armed with literature from the internet and 
    a first hand account of how this cream works, she will have to give you the 
    prescription. If she doesn't, than you'll just have to find another doctor.<BR>
    We had to go to a few before I was able to get it.<BR>
    Roxane<BR>
    >>Ed,<BR>
    >>I have heard from 2 adults who have used the topical steroid cream successfully 
    and have read quite a bit about it. Stretching is not necessary with this 
    cream.<BR>
    >>I don't know about it's availability in the UK. You may have to go to your 
    doctor armed with literature from the web.<BR>
    >>Let me know if you need anymore help. I can give you some web sites and 
    also forward your letter to someone who's been through this (if you like).<BR>
    >>Roxane<BR>
    >Roxane,<BR>
    > Many thanks for the reply. I would appreciate any further help you can give, 
    like more web addresses (perhaps it is possible to buy this cream over the 
    web from the US?) and by all means forward on my letter to anyone you feel 
    can help me.<BR>
    >The UK GP system is a nightmare, and I do not hold out much hope of getting 
    my GP to prescribe this. His reaction to my problem has been bery unsympathetic, 
    he examined me for all of 2 seconds, did not even see the problem with an 
    errection, never told me what I had, just said that I needed to be circumcised, 
    end of discussion. I quizzed him for alternatives and he said there were none 
    for someone of my age.<BR>
    >This attitude is partly ignorance and partly eccononics, our so called new 
    medical market ecconomy drives our doctors to find the cheapest and easiest 
    solution for the system rather than the patient...<BR>
    >Ed<BR>
    ><BR>
    >>>Hello all,<BR>
    >>> What a relief to have found your site! I would appreciate very much any 
    help you could all give me, or perhaps refer me to another source of advice 
    for my problem. Thank you in advance for spending the time considering my 
    problem.<BR>
    >>>I am a 32 year old male. I have a 6" penis. Since a child I have had an 
    incredibly tight foreskin.<BR>
    >>>When my penis is flaccid my foreskin covers my penis completely and comfortably.<BR>
    >>>In the flaccid state I can withdraw the foreskin completely to reveal the 
    head with no problems, and often do for hygiene purposes etc.<BR>
    >>>When my penis is fully erect I can only reveal about 10% of the head before 
    the foreskin tightens too much. If I try to force the foreskin back in an 
    errect state my penis/head becomes almost unbearably painful, and sex in this 
    condition is agony.<BR>
    >>>With my penis semi hard I am able to withdraw the foreskin back to the 
    base of the head, if I then progress to full erection with the foreskin behind 
    my head, the foreskin constricts to an extent that my head becomes deep purple 
    as the blood flow is being constricted. I can have some sex like this but 
    unless I have abstained form sex for weeks, I can only tolerate a few minuets 
    of sex before the pain overrides any pleasure. Whenever I have done this the 
    foreskin gets slightly stuck behind my head, but not in an unconfortable way, 
    and will take a few days before returning to normal.<BR>
    >>>After all these years my head has become incredibly sensitive due to the 
    lack of exposure and the whole thing is affecting my sex life adversely, as 
    I am very unconfident about being able to have pleasurable sex, which in turn 
    has limited the opportunities and pleasure I can experience.<BR>
    >>>I have been to my local GP (doctor) for advice who very quickly told me 
    that circumcision was the only answer. I do not think this is right as everything 
    I have read about circumcision seems very negative and it does seem such an 
    extreme solution.<BR>
    >>>Finally I began trawling the web and found you guys and the Tripod <A HREF="../../../welcome.html#start">now: 
    Male Initiation.net</A>) & Cirp sites.<BR>
    >>>I read about Michel Beauge and began to hope there was a solution other 
    than surgery.<BR>
    >>>Having absorbed about as much as I can from the web I would like to try 
    stretching as a remedy, but despite all the articles on it I am still a little 
    uncertain how to go about stretching my foreskin.<BR>
    >>>Should I do it when flaccid, or erect?<BR>
    >>>How long should before I see some results?<BR>
    >>>Should I use Astro Glide, and if so how easy is it to obtain in the UK? 
    (Over the counter at a chemsit?)<BR>
    >>>What technique is best?<BR>
    >>>When masterbating I always keep my foreskin over my head, and have never 
    had any problems ejaculating. Mr Beauge mentions adopting a different technique 
    when masterbating. Does anyone know what this technique is?<BR>
    >>>I have just read Roxane mention Topical Sterod Cream. <BR>
    >>>Can this help in an adult? How would one obtain it in the UK?<BR>
    >>>Sorry for all the questions, I am just desperate to find a solution I can 
    live with.<BR>
    >>>Many thanks- Ed Recio.

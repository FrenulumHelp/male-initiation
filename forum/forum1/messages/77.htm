Hello James,<P>
Thanks a lot for the ARC forum entry on "betamethasone .05%"<P>
Sorry to have left your letter for so so long, this may sound like a very good excuse, but honestly with potions and lotions I was interested in the long term effects, so ... could you tell me / us if you are now "cured" successfully with no problems<P>
>I did some research and found a prescription called >"betamethasone .05%".  <P>
If I remember correctly its one of the papers on CIRP which discusses this - could you remind me which - or where did you do your research?<P>
If everything has worked well then I`ll certainly thank you for your experiment and recommend the possibility further<P>

>I just saw my doctor about this condition.  I've had it for about a year and decided to get it checked.  I did some research and found a prescription called "betamethasone .05%".  I asked my doctor about it and he said to give it a try.  In just 4 days I've noticed my foreskin is more elastic.  I've talked with other men and they said in from 1 to 2 months their foreskin was back to being fully elastic.  I'm 44 and I did not want to be circumcised.  I've been just fine with my foreskin all these years. </BLOCKQUOTE> <HR ALIGN="CENTER" WIDTH="600" SIZE="1" NOSHADE>  <CENTER>

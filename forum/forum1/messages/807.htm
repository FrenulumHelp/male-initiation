>I am 14 and the foreskin and my glans seem to be connected a little bit on the underside of my penis. It is even connected to my frenelum. I dont know what to do, is there a creme i can get to relieve this, i think what i have is adhesion. i dont know<P>
-----------------------------------------------
  <P> Don't confusion adhesions, which are areas of skin still attaching the foreskin 
    to the penis head, with phimosis, which is a foreskin too tight but not attached. 
    The frenum should not prevent retraction of the foreskin off the head even 
    though it connects to it. Many common lubricants can aid in working adhesions 
    loose, but some require a doctors treatment.<BR>
    The creams usually discussed in many of these posts are for phimosis, and 
    only work to make the skin thinner and plyable so it may be stretched wider. 
    There is a boy with a problem very much like yours in the fathermag.org/forum 
    page under 'teen sex' today. I am still not sure if either of you are having 
    a problem with the frenum or some different adhesion. Look for the color drawing 
    on circlist.org/canatomy.html#anchor1976482 in the bottom right corner of 
    the page and tell us if you are referring to the frenum shown in yellow, or 
    something else. </BLOCKQUOTE>

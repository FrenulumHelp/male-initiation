Hi Rob,<BR>
Glad to hear your doctor didn't give you a hard time about prescribing the cream.<BR>
Also glad Nick answered you. He's the authority on Betamethasone and using it as an adult.<BR>
You might want to ask your doctor if it would be OK to use lidocaine cream for glan sensitivity. It's non-prescriptive, but you should get your doctor's <BR>
assurance that it's safe before using it on such a sensitive area.<BR>
It probably wouldn't sting the way the ambesol did on Nick.<BR>
Keep us updated. I'm sure there's more than a few interested readers.<BR>
Good Luck.<BR>
Roxane
  <P> >Hi guys - hi Roxanne - i hope you're reading this , your experience would 
    help.<BR>
    >Ok, I got the betamethasone cream from my doctor .. although he himself doesn't 
    know too much about it only that he believes it might work.<BR>
    >So now i got questions - right way to apply it ? and how much should i apply 
    it and where - i mean how far down do i put it on from the tip ?<BR>
    >My doctor said that if it is successful, my glans would be really sensitive 
    - maybe even painful, how can I minimize the pain ?<BR>
    >THANX IN ADVANCE!

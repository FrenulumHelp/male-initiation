For someone with such a vague diagnosis, I can only suggest you read my welcome page ... your description sounds typical for frenulum breve which will not require a circumcision, but you definately need to educate yourself a bit more otherwise you`ll be at the doctors mercy.<P>

Thanks for responding Nick - sometime it could be an interesting experiment for someone with a short frenulum to try out Betamethasone as a way of thinning and stretching the skin - but that must be after diagnosis and with the warning that with the frenulum it is an experiment.<P>
Otherwise I repeat I`m glad for your Betamethasone influence around the forum and I`m looking forward to a few long term reports.
  <P> Robin

Hi Alan,<BR>
The cream works on congenital phimosis as well. The trick is getting your doctor to prescribe it. Most doctors don't know about it yet, so go armed with literature about it from the web. If you read Nick's postings he tells how he used the cream when he was 18 and hasn't had any problems since. Also I've described how we used the cream on my son.<BR>
If you need anymore info or help finding a doctor who will prescribe the cream please feel free to E-Mail me.<BR>

    to relate to..<BR>
    >Here's my problem - I've never been able to fully retract my foreskin; The 
    best<BR>
    >I can do is stretch it to the point that the meatus - the slit part - is 
    showing. I've read about the creams but do they only work for "acquired phimosis" 
    ? - i've had this problem all my life and I'm 20 now.<BR>
    >I also have a question for those people that don't have a problem with their 
    phimosis and aren't planning on doing anything about it. When I urinate, some 
    urine is left under the foreskin and I have to do quite a bit of work to totally 
    get rid of it which is sometimes not possible especially when I'm outside 
    of the house .. this leaves small, but embarassing stains on my underpants 
    - does anyone else have this problem ?

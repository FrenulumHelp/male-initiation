I have heard that surgery is available in the usa for $800. That means that it should be available in the uk for £400. But I can't find any privately advertising doctors/hospitals that can provide the cremes that I require. Can anyone assist here? Also do you think a high dosage of topical cremes over a long time applied daily would resolve this problem without a need for surgery?

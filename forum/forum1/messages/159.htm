thanks to Robin Stuart's well organized and informative site I've been able to realize that there was an actual name to my discomfort.<P>
I am one of many men whose punishment for circumcision has been the formation of a skinbridge. I was circumcised at birth and have always felt awkward and self-concious about the fused skin on my penis.<P>
I understand that the proper course of action to remove a skinbridge is to see a Eurologist. I'm curious to know: if such a proceedure could be done in the office or if outpatient surgery is required?, what type of anesthesia is required?, what type of recovery period I should expect?, and most of all.. will my insurance cover any involved fee?

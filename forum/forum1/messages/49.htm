It seems that you may not have a serious problem since it will retract easily while flaccid. What happens when you retract and it gets erect? do you have a problem getting it back over the rim of the glans?<BR>
I suspect that some gentle stretching may work wonders- just don't try to do it all at once. It may be that your frenulum is too short if it pulls the glans down when retracted- if so a fairly simple trimming of the frenulum where it attaches to the glans can release it a lot.<BR>
Depending on your age- you may still be growing and the problem will be solved by merely stretching while masturbating over time.<BR>
good luck<P>

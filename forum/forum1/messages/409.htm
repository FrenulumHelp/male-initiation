>I'm mystified by the statement, "I just use lube like a cut guy."  As a  (happily) cut guy with some years' experience, I've never had to use lube.  Of course, my lady friends have been pretty good at supplying plenty of natural lubricant, and my constantly-exposed glans may be tough enough to permit me to penetrate without any pain or problem (to either of us).  Just a comment in passing.  Cheers, RJK.<P>
Dunno, guess it depends on if your old and your skin is like leather.  All the cut guys I know use lube or they rub themselves or their girl friend raw.  I guess you just do it with juicy women.

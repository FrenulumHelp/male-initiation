You may have to use it for up to 8 weeks. If it still hasn't worked by then ask your doctor about Kenalog cream (.1%). We saw results within days when we used it on our son.<BR>
Hope all goes well.<BR>

>  I`m 18 and having problems with phimosis since i found it, about 4-5 years ago. It wasn`t really 'problems' but it is unpleasant when masturbating since I can 'see' only a small part of glance and it hurts if i try to retract it more. I used some cream about 2 weeks now and it doesn`t seem to work. It has 0.5% betamethasone in it, i`m using it twice a day, somethimes three times. But it doesn`t seem to work, or should i use it for a longer period? Is there any other way, except 'cuttin' myself :(

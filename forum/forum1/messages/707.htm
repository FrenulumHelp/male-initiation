    And that's just the point, you'll never know. Too many boys and men go through 
    life in ignorance, never knowing that their foreskin is made to retract for 
    a reason. Long before the age of puberty, normal childhood adhesions have 
    separated the foreskin from the penis head in all but a small handful of normal, 
    healthy boys. As puberty approaches, smegma and other secretions begin to 
    cause itching that encourages the foreskin to be retracted. The penis begins 
    to grow at an accelerated rate, and it wants to get out and breathe. By adulthood, 
    many men's foreskin will naturally retract and atrophy, but this is often 
    not soon enough to avoid problems. It should be helped along at every chance. 
    If phimosis is discovered, or paraphimosis is so severe that the retracted 
    foreskin is uncomfortable and strangling the penis, retracting is the way 
    to find out so it can be corrected right away. </BLOCKQUOTE>

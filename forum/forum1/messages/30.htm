Hi Steve.<P>
It sounds as if you have worked out a lot of things already.  <P>
I was circumcised at 26 for phimosis, but had a full circ.  I am also in the UK, and had my circ on the NHS.  My surgeon was excellent, and did leave me a lot of loose skin, which is still stretching 10 years on.<P>
I can understand the fear over 'too much being taken off'.  I reckon that this will come down to a discussion with your surgeon.  When I was cut I knew nothing of circumcision, and my own doctor was against it.  I think that how much comes off can depend on the structure of your foreskin.  I know now that a partial would probably not have been possible for me because of the arrangement of large blood vessels in my foreskin.<P>
I think that in your case I would also question why I wanted to do it.  I imagine that you will be asked.  You are able to have sex, and can clean under your foreskin - although until my operation, I was unable to clean under my foreskin, with no ill effect.  So the big question is Why ?  It is surgery and will be painful.  Is it about how you feel now and how you hope to feel different ?<P>
Anyway, as you say in your posting, it is a matter of going to the doctor, armed with information and saying "This is what I want, How do I go about getting it!"<P>
Good Luck,<P>
Dave.<P>

  <P> David, Have you read that piece by the guy who cut his own skin bridges, 
    in http://www.tripod.co.uk/origins? <A HREF="../../../welcome.html#start">now: 
    Male Initiation.net</A>) It makes a good read, but I dont know that it would 
    be a good idea to follow him unless your skin bridges are very small. I'm 
    sure it's better to get rid of skin bridges if you can, because they block 
    off one of the most sensitive parts of your cock, the groove between your 
    shaft and your corona, and a visit to a urologist, as you suggest, is the 
    best thing. I dont have any skin bridges myself, since I was circumcised as 
    an adult, but I've come across several guys who have. How much trouble yours 
    would be to treat depends on how big they are. I guess that if you've just 
    got a few say a quarter inch or so wide, it's the sort of thing that could 
    be done in the doctor's office, with a local anaesthetic, and if it's done 
    carefully, there's very little scarring either on you knob or on the shaft 
    skin. But if you are like one poor guy I met once, with a sort of continuous 
    skin bridge all the way round, it would obviously be a more serious business 
    to put it right Only a urologist can advise.

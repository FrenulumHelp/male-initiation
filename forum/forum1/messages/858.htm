  <P> >>Can someone help me. I am uncircimucised. When i am limp i can retract 
    the foreskin all the way. However, when i get an errection, i try to roll 
    my foreskin back to underneath the head and i cant do it. It will go about 
    half way of the head and then will not go any further withouth there being 
    pain. What problem am i having? Im only 17 right now but ive gone through 
    puberty, i got pubes and all that stuff. Can someone help me. Do i just need 
    to stretch it more or what?<BR>
    >Tod, since you can stretch the foreskin all the way back when flaccid and 
    halfway back when erect, it shouldn't be much of a problem to stretch the 
    skin a bit more so it's retractable at all times. You might try slowly pushing 
    it all the way back, then letting it slide forward and pushing it back again, 
    repeating this for 10 times, then washing it carefully to prevent infection 
    & leaving the foreskin forward. Then you can repeat this stretching exercise 
    again the next day, and again for a period of ten days or two weeks, by which 
    time it should be loose enough to move at any time. It might help the stretching 
    to leave the foreskin retracted for a while before returning it to its usual 
    position. If this doesn't have any effect, you can try to stretch it back 
    further than it "wants" to go when the penis is erect, or partially so. This 
    may be painful but you should be able to see definite results in a short time.<BR>
    >If this doesn't work, you can always see a doctor & possibly try a steroid 
    cream, but judging from your description of the condition, it probably doesn't 
    require drastic remedial action, and can soon be corrected. Good luck! RJK.

Hi I am very very very worried...ok I'm 14 years old and I was never circumcised (because I was born prematurely and was jaundice).  Anyhoo, when I have an erection I am unable to retract my skin...and probably can't when it's not erect (I cant tell cuz I don't have enough room to pull it back when it isn't erect).<BR>
Anyways, when it's erect the end comes to a tip and the whole is big enough for pee to go through...And I can't retract it at all.  If i pull back on it it just uhh does nothing...<BR>
[I DO NOT WANT TO BE CIRCUMCISED] please tell me there is something I can do<BR>
I am very worried and I am scared.  When I was younger I never retracted my foreskin like I was supposed to and now I wish I could go back in time and fix that...Anyhoo please tell me there is something that can be done other than circumcision.  I'd kill myself if I had to be circumcised!

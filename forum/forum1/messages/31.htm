Hi!<P>
>I may have phimosis. During an erection I can't pull my skin back. It's tight around the "head", but there is an opening. When it is flaccid I can pull it back behind the head, but instead of "sliding", it sort of "rolls" back behind the head and I don't experience any pain when I do this. <P>
Just before it starts rolling over, can you see a thin line of white from the phimotic ring?<P>
There may be a mixture of partial phimosis and a frenulum breve, can you see - when flaccid with the foreskin retracted, turn the glans over and in the "V" shape underneath the glans,- is the foreskin all bagged up together and drawn in? or does the "V" shape lie free?<P>
The other check for frenulum breve is when erect does the attempt at retraction cause the "head" of the phallus to bend downwards.<P>
>I've never tried pulling back further. I've never had intercourse and >I've read some guys saying that this will not pose a problem during intercourse. I'm 29 years old. <P>
Ho-hum, make up your own mind after you`ve had it corrected. - Phimotic ring needs either a partial circ or a very small dorsal slit through the ring, ... frenulum breve requires a frenoplasty takes 30 mins, (or a simple slit in 10) ... for an hours day patient surgery, 2 weeks recovery, the worst part in the UK are the NHS waiting lists ... I`d guess one in two urologists would *enjoy* performing the operation - if you dont have any luck with referals from your GP try ringing the local hospital direct ,,,<P>
I hope that`s some help<BR>

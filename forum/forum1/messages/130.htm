Thanks for the response.  Perhaps the ring is not lichenous.  What I am currently attempting is wearing the skin retracted.<P>
I am using first aid waterproof tape.  I hope to eliminate any possible causes of tightening by "drying" the area out.  I will continue with streching with the use of cream and oils.<P>
<BR>
I have probably given the wrong impression in my previous correspondence.  The tightness and ring are not severe.  I have absolutely no difficulty with retraction in either state.  There is however a slight tightness and minimal hourglass effect when fully retracted (pulled taught).  I do not think that any invasive measures are needed.<P>
As well, I found that tightness began when I stopped the use of soap when bathing the glans and inner skin.  I read in a German publication that one should only use water when cleaning the area.  There seemed to be a corelation with the forming of the ring and discontinuance of the use of soap.  Might this have promoted certain bacteria to remain leading to a ring and tightness?

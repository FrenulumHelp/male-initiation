Ok, This may be a bit confusing for all you doctors and such out there because I dont know all the proper terminoligy for this stuff but hey, its definetly the best I can do at this time.<P>
So I wasnt even aware that I had the problem untill recently..  Basicly my problem is that I cant get my forskin to go back over the "head" (sulcus?) without causing EXTREME pain..  I have no idea what I should really do and im not intrested at all in having curcumcision (That and I dont know if its neccesary).  Another problem is that I live in a small town where confidentiality is not a sure thing and I would like to keep this quiet so Im not about to go see the doctor over it.  <P>
As you can see its probably not that big of a problem, but for me it most definetly is... I have a girlfriend and we havnt had sex yet but I dont want to have any problems when we finaly do decide too have sex.  Peer pressure is wonderfull dont you agree?? :)<P>
Thanks for any help that you can give, its greatly apreciated..

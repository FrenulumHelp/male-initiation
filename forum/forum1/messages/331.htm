Glad to hear that the betamethasone is working.<BR>
If you should have difficulty again, try pinching the glans between your thumb and forefinger. I have read that this is the thing to do when the foreskin gets caught behind the glans (paraphimosis).<BR>
Please keep us informed. My son will have to use the cream someday himself and <BR>
I am interested in hearing how things work out for you.<BR>

&gt;&gt;Hi guys, I started using Betamethasone around the end of February,
&gt;&gt;today I was able to retract my foreskin almost totally (flacid state)
&gt;&gt;and I noticed how much dirt accumulated all these years. I started cleaning
&gt;&gt;it and wiping all the dirt away. As I retracted further (there was no pain but I could see the tip of the foreskin getting red) it seemed like it got stuck.
&gt;&gt;Soon my glans turned a little blue .. Frightened I pulled on the foreskin and
&gt;&gt;eventually got it back up .. 
&gt;&gt;any input on this would help thanks.

As an answer to: <A HREF="607.htm">Maybe Not Paraphimosis</A> written by Charles II at 25 Aug 2000 04:23:35:
  <P> Certainly you don't have paraphimosis because that is a condition in which 
    a very tight ring of scar tissue in the foreskin cuts off circulation to the 
    glans when the ring is pushed back behind the glans, and in serious cases 
    can threaten the glans with gangrene. Your condition on the other hand is 
    perfectly normal, and you share it with thousands of other men and boys. It 
    just results from having a foreskin that is naturally short, so it doesn't 
    cover the entire glans. There is certainly no cause for worry on your part, 
    and every reason just to relax and enjoy it (which your girlfriend may do, 
    too)! Some doctors have called it "autocircumcision" and the "circumcisionoid" 
    condition, and when I was in the army the guys called it being "skinned back," 
    but I'm not sure it deserves a name: it's just at one end of the normal bell 
    curve encompassing natural variation, where most guys have just enough skin 
    to cover the glans and others (at the other end of the curve) have extra skin 
    that overhangs the end of the penis. End of lecture! Seriously, you're lucky 
    and have no worries. Cheers, RJK. <BR>
    >>hi. I think I have paraphimosis my foreskin is behind the gland of my penis 
    all the time. It will stretch over the gland but it retracts behind the gland 
    if let go. I am wondering if this is normal, do many people have this condition 
    or is it something not to be worried about? please write!<BR>
    >MR RESPONSE: It may not be paraphimosis, which is a condition requiring medical 
    or other treatment due to the foreskin being so tight that it chokes the penis 
    and causes pain or swelling. A foreskin that is merely snug and comfortable 
    in its retracted position, or short enough to want to, is ideal and in no 
    need of treatment. Mine and others I know have been fully retracted permanently 
    since about puberty, and we wouldn't want it any other way. Lucky you. </BLOCKQUOTE>

John, if you and your girlfriend are really keen on each other, you really should talk about it with her. I *know* it's really difficult to do that - believe me, I know! - but you might have to take a chance. She might be thinking you don't really find her attractive, and that's why the sex is Not Happening! <P>
Above all, honey, it's not that abnormal - as you can see from this forum - and you've got lots of support here. Like Nick says, relax. And take some action about it.

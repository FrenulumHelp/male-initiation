You have something to worry about because it is painful, (but the bruising should slowly recede and should look almost normal after a week), go back to the doctor<BR>

  <P> >I recently underwnet a Frenoplasty to correct a tear in my frenulum. However 
    a week later it is still bleeding slightly and is quite painful. I have noticed 
    that the tip of my penis however seems to be very dark almost black. Is this 
    a result of brusing from the operation or do i have something to worry about 
    ?

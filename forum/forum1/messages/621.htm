  <P> Hi,<BR>
    have you already solved your problem?<BR>
    I´m 37 and when I was 14 I realized my foreskin was attached to glans(I don´t 
    know the right translation)... attached to "penis head". Although I could 
    place foreskin back, my "head" only appeared to the half of it, beeing obvious 
    to me at that moment that foreskin should release the "head" completly. Guess 
    what I did!!! I began to pull every day foreskin back forcing it to rupture 
    the skin. It obviously was a painfull job, that took several weeks.I had to 
    bring back 1/4 inch aprox.can you imagine? Anyway, when I was reaching pennis 
    "head" the task became easer until I finally did it. Finally free!!<BR>
    Nevertheless, during the first times of "real action" I used to end with a 
    very little extra rupture, specially when the girls where to tight.<BR>
    Hope you solve your problem soon. Now with 37 years my advise is to get surgery, 
    partially or not, as girls never mind. In all the different ways women take 
    it (anal, straight, or oral) they receive it "undressed" anyway. <BR>
    "It has no eyes , but it has a head and thinks".<BR>
    I'm 17 and I've just discovered I have this problem. Up until a month or two 
    ago I thought my penis was normal. I didn't know the foreskin wasn't supposed 
    to<BR>
    >cover the glans all the time, no-one ever told me that. It was only when 
    I saw a TV programme that I researched it on the net. I don't want to get 
    circumcised, not even partially, if I can avoid it. Anyone got any advice?

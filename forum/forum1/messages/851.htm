As an answer to: <A HREF="376.htm">Frenulum/Smegma</A> written by John at 26 Apr 2000 10:33:08:<P>
I was circumcised recently,  and didnt think to ask about what happend with the frenulum?  I just assumed the surgeon would do with it what was right.  I have a quite a long frenulum - well, I didnt think it was any longer than most.  Anyway, after the op, the surgeon told me it had caused a couple of hassles.  In stead of removing it completely which would have solved the problem, he left it and it looks strange as it sticks out a mile, where the foreskin covered it once before.<BR>
I am thinking aboutgetting the frenulum totally removed?  Does anyone know if this will involve going back into hopsital, or can it be done in a quick session?

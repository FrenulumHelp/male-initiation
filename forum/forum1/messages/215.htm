Hey this is excellant news, ... only too pleased as a Brit to support the medicinal values of tea, ...<P>
Now - ? - penile hypersensitivity is not really an important theme for me, BUT how to speed up keratinization is THE BIG PROBLEM with releasing adhesions in kids. <BR>
    <A HREF="../../../dissolve.html#start">http://www.male-initiation.net/dissolve.html</A><BR>
Adhesions release as the result of "keratinization" ... like are you suggesting this could be the big break through ... ???<P>
Tea is rich in tannins with this I agree; but could you argue why tannins could be expected to promote keritinisation ...? <P>
>I do remember from somewhere that<BR>
>tannins were promoted at one time as an ingredient in <BR>
>burn ointments (which of course makes the connection<BR>
>to keratinisation tenuous at best!). <P>
Tannin is used to cure leather, (so is urine) - (is it used to colour leather or to harden it up?) ... the leather tanning process may well provide a few keratinization methods ...<P>

well I reckon we need to get Joe to do a bit of experimenting (at his own risk) because whatever wroks for adults has a chance of working with kids<P>

I feel sure there must be some very simple substance which would help release infant adhesions -> allow kids to stretch the potential tightness out of their own foreskins before it started being a problem . ................. maybe we can hope that someone with an extra sensitive glans can do a bit of experimenting and give us some ideas<P>

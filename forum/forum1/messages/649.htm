  <P> Hi, The worst thing you could do would be getting circumcised. Go to a urologist 
    and ask a lot of questions but tell him that circumcision is out of the question. 
    I know, I have foreskin and nearly every doctor I have ever been to has wanted 
    to circumcise my foreskin just because its still on my penis. I think they 
    are money hungry and a little perverted. Save that wonderful foreskin at all 
    costs.

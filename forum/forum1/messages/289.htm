Thanks for the help everyone ..<BR>
I've been applying the cream for about a week now, the foreskin seems<BR>
a little looser and I am able to stretch the opening only slightly larger <BR>
than before. I was wondering if I should be getting more significant <BR>
results by now ?
  <P> >>Hi guys - hi Roxanne - i hope you're reading this , your experience would 
    help.<BR>
    >>Ok, I got the betamethasone cream from my doctor .. although he himself 
    doesn't know too much about it only that he believes it might work.<BR>
    >I had phimosis until I was 18. I used betamethasone and it worked great.<BR>
    ><BR>
    >>So now i got questions - right way to apply it ? and how much should i apply 
    it and where - i mean how far down do i put it on from the tip ?<BR>
    >Good question. Start applying it today. I applied it after I got out of the 
    shower each morining. I put enough on so that the foreskin was entirely covered 
    (but not so much that it all wipes off onto your pants). I applied it from 
    the tip of the foreskin to about half way down to the glans.<BR>
    >>My doctor said that if it is successful, my glans would be really sensitive 
    - maybe even painful, how can I minimize the pain ?<BR>
    >>THANX IN ADVANCE!<BR>
    >Oh yes, I do remember that. What I did was this: I got some "ambesol" (tooth 
    ache liquid. the kind you put on your gums to numb it). I put a bit of it 
    on my glans with a medicine dropper. BUT BE CAREFUL AT THIS POINT!!! It will 
    burn. So what I did was kept a small cup full of *cold* water near me. After 
    I put the ambesol on and it started to burn, I gently poured some water on 
    it (just enough to stop the burning. Too much and you wash away the ambesol). 
    Then I took a q-tip (you could use that, a wash cloth or anything else) and 
    rubbed it firmly over my glans. I did this for about 15-20 minutes. I did 
    this or 3 seperate times. That really helped decrease the pain. You also have 
    to touch your glans a lot. Just rub it with your finger or something. In about 
    a month or two it wont hurt anymore. Email me if you want. Good luck!<BR>

As an answer to: <A HREF="745.htm">Re: Urinating problem</A> written by GREG at 26 Oct 2000 03:28:37:
  <P> We sometimes see diapers for adults advertised on U.S. television. I seem 
    to remember the trade name "Pampers" for them but would not stake my life 
    on this. (They're recommendwed for both men & women with this problem.) In 
    any case, if you go to a shop that supplies medical needs and ask for something 
    to help control incontinence, the people there should be able to help you. 
    Best wishes, RJK.<BR>
    >>I have a urnating problem and I need to find out where I can get diapers 
    in a big size i am 28 and I can't seem to find them. HELP ME PLEASE.<BR>
    >GO TO A STORE AND THEY SHOULD HAVE SOME THING FOR ADULT INCONTINACE.

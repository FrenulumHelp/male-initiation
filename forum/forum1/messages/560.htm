>I'm 17 and I've just discovered I have this problem. Up until a month or two ago I thought my penis was normal. I didn't know the foreskin wasn't supposed to<BR>
>cover the glans all the time, no-one ever told me that. It was only when I saw a TV programme that I researched it on the net. I don't want to get circumcised, not even partially, if I can avoid it. Anyone got any advice? 
  <P> I'm 20 and had the same problem until I was 18. I didnt know it was supposed 
    to go back all the way either. I got a prescription from my doctor for a common 
    steriodal creme called "betamethasone .05%". Heres the link I found about 
    it. Print it out and show it to your doctor: http://www.cirp.org/library/treatment/phimosis/wright/<BR>
    Apply it once per day to the **outside** of your foreskin from the opening 
    tip to about mid-glans (mid head). You should see results in the first week 
    but it may take as long as 6-8 weeks (mine took that long).<BR>
    If you have any questions, please feel free to email me.<BR>

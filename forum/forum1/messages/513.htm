As an answer to: <A HREF="322.htm">Re: BXO</A> written by rs at 20 Mar 2000 01:35:36:
  <P> Sorry that it has taken so long to respond. I am not circumcised. It is 
    now July and still no evidence of BXO. The reason I say it has done the trick 
    for now is that I was under tremendous stress last year for work (requiring 
    that I fly weekly out of town) and I think that there is a cause and affect. 
    I cannot prove it though and the stress at work was gone by the end of last 
    year. But, I am convinced that stress can cause problems with your body and 
    we may not make the connection. So, I am fearful that if I go through another 
    stressful time, it will reappear. </BLOCKQUOTE>

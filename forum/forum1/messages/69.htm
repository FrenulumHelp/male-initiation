I had frenulum breve until I was about 25 then had it taken care of by a simple trim. You can tell if the head or glans is pulled down when you retract when soft or flaccid- mine was very tight and would not allow retraction when erect except to just behind the glans and it was very tight. The frenulum attached all the way to the lower part of the opening at the end and now is trimmed back to below the inverted V at the underside. In my case, no frentulum was removed and it retreated into the foreskin and thru stretching primarily by retracting further and further over time while erect, I can now retract fully with no 'ring' along the shaft I think Robin's advice to slow down and not take any action which you will live with for the rest of your life is good- continue to study it and arrive at an informed decision as you will likely know more about the subject than many of the professionals you encounter.<BR>
Also, Robin's advice to another inquiry to check www.foreskin.org is good- it shows a frenulum up close as well as other issues of stretching etc with very good quality pictures rather than drawings.

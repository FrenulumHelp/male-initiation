  <P> >>Firstly I would like to thank Robin for such a well presented and imformative 
    site, keep up the good work, Its much appreciated.<BR>
    >>It would appear that I fall into the category of a recently presented relative 
    phimosis. As such it would appear that my only options are surgical; my doctor 
    would only reccomended a full circumcision.<BR>
    >>There doesnt seem to be much in the way of suggested causes for this type 
    of phimosis, If, as I suspect I will, I opt for a partial circ, it would be 
    nice to do all i can to prevent this from happening again.......<BR>
    >>I would also like to ask, If i do end up with a full circ, is masturbation 
    without the topbit the same as with, surely it must rub...?<BR>
    >>Regards<BR>

    >>Robin : If I get a little more spare time I might contact you about helping 
    out with the admin... <BR>
    I was circumcised in my twenties. No big deal. People said I would lose sensitivity. 
    I haven't noticed it. Like anything else you'll need to change your masturbation 
    "holds" and techniques a bit. But it's fun and my orgasms have been even better 
    since I was cut. </BLOCKQUOTE>

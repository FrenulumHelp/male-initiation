Well, the biggest problem you have is the one you're building in your mind.  I'm not circumcised and my foreskin has always been tight.  I had several doctors tell me I had to be circumcised.  I didn't want that so I just said no.  I finally found out about the steroid creams and I TOLD a doctor I wanted to try that.  He objected, said it wouldn't work and I should be circumcised and I said, well the cream can't hurt anything to try.  What could he say?  I got the prescription and got the cream at the chemist and....  IT WORKED, how about that!<P>
I know the tip of my foreskin will always be tight but I can bring my foreskin right back although with a stiffie I have to do it slowly.  Doesn't matter though, cos my dick loves the attention while it's happening <G><P>
As far as penetrative sex, before I used the cream, I just gooed everything up with lube like cut guys do and it worked fine with the foreskin staying forward...  and like you said, a wank with my foreskin is incredible, no need to bring my foreskin back, just play with the tip and slip the skin to and fro over the knob
  <P> Look on the bright side, you've got a great dick that you want to make a 
    minor adjustment to, so get to it. If the doctor gives you a load of crap, 
    tell him to piss off, it's your dick, not his.

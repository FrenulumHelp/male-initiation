    If the frenulum is tight enough to be giving you trouble, then you need to 
    find a doctor you can trust and ask for advice. You probably won't need to 
    have anything cut off, but it may be necessary to make a cut that will free 
    it from binding the glans & foreskin. Probably no one can advise you simply 
    from your Internet description, but chances are the problem can be solved 
    quickly and fairly simply and painlessly by a physician who knows what he/she 
    is doing. Good luck! RJK.

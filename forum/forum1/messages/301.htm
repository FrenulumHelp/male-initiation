Hi Marnie, <P>
thank You for posting, too. Let's start "talking"!<P>
As You know, I'm from Germany and here is RIC completely unknown (exept turkish people and jews, of course). <P>
For me it would be interesting to know, what a mother is thinking, when she decides to go for circumcision whith the child (is it the most normal thing, is it a special kind of care, ...) are you standing besides and look at this procedure performing?<P>
What are the feelings of a mother of a circ'd child, when You see his small, circumcised willy? Are You proud of it, do You think it is good for the future wife, do You think that he got propper health-care?<P>
Perhaps - or sure - this sounds if I would be anti-circ; but this is not true!!!<P>
I'm only interested in knowing these things, because here in Germany this procedure is not routinely performed. I can not talk about this, because no mother or father is doing so!<P>
I'm thoroughly convinced, that RIC is not only not a bad thing, there are different advatages! I had been very thankful, if my parents had decided to get me circ'd!!! (I got circ'd for different reasons, when I was 27.) <P>
But although this is my conviction I would not have the nerves to fight against all people around me and get a future son circumcised!<P>
Perhaps You understand my interest and can answer.<P>
Happy (cut) greetings from Germany<P>
Peter

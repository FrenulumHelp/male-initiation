As an answer to: <A HREF="386.htm">Hydrocortisone cream</A> written by Craig at 06 May 2000 15:59:43:<P>
Try betamethasone instead.  Both hydrocortisone and betamethasone are corticosteroid drugs (so you will probably need to get a prescription from your doctor for either of them) but beta is the more usual application for phimosis.  Incidentally, it may also be used as a treatment for eczema, psoriasis, allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and arthritis!<P>
Beta should only be used sparingly, as it can cause thinning of the skin and may also aggravate pre-existing skin infections.<P>
Swallow your pride, and make an appointment to see your doctor to chat things over with him/her.<P>

>I read a while back that Hydrocortsion cream can help to aid a tight foreskin because of its skin thinning effect.  Has anyone tried of heard of this before?

        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                                <TD WIDTH="302"><B>I admit to a very strong personal bias. I started this site with 
                                  the intention of demonstrating that boys must be checked before puberty. 
                                  This bias is based on my personal experience. It was almost immediately 
                                  after discovering my condition at the tender age of 43, that I <I>knew</I> this should have been checked before puberty.</B></TD>

                            </TABLE>
                            <P><A HREF="library/passages/diary.html#start">My personal experience</A> was quite extreme, I have heard only few 
                              similar cases. At the beginning of puberty during the first explorations 
                              of my male body and masturbation, pulling my foreskin back had an effect 
                              which was difficult and painful. People avoid difficulty and pain, and                                   
                              
                            so, as one would 
                              expect from any healthy little boy,  I learnt to avoid retracting my foreskin. 
                            <P>Both expert and popular thinking maintain that sexual disturbances 
                              are always caused by environment or upbringing and parents, this contradicts 
                              my experience.                    
                            <P>One could say the energy behind this site was generated by the conflict 
                    between my personal experience and our cultures normal understanding 
                    of sexual behaviour. 
                            
                            <P>I`m the sort of person who writes, - my note book is a like a friend 
                              who I discuss things with - writing is a form of therapy. At first 
                              (July 94), I wrote by hand and then as the quantity of paper increased 
                              I decided to buy my first computer in Christmas 94/95 - I didn`t know 
                              what I was writing - maybe a book. </P>
                            <P>Around this time the world started 
                              to learn about Internet, but in those days even computer experts in 
                              Europe had no real ideas what this was or how to get on it. I persevered 
                            and by Feb. 96 I was on-line with Version One of the first circumcision/phimosis site in Europe and the first 8 pages.</P>

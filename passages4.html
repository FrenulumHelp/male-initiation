        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                            <P> The first symptoms of the conditions often appear with the first 
                              consciously active erection. 
                              Problems are treated following 
                              a conscious experience of pain, difficulty or tension. The easy step of monitoring previous to puberty, and preventing these problems in advance, plays little part in modern health care.

                              PHIMOTIC RING</B><BR>
                              The rubbing action of a phimotic ring repeatedly passing over the coronal 
                              ridge of the glans causes pain and soreness, which may subsequently 
                              develop into inflammations or infections. Among my interviewed sample 
                              group, one practicing doctor described how an infection became so obvious 
                              that he was forced to tell his parents. A second, on reading this, 
                              said that his was a similar experience. The third medical doctor who 
                              I questioned had no infection, but reported masturbating painfully 
                              for five years, till he was 18. 
                            <P>A number of reports describe painful masturbation for several years 
                              usually until 18 when the boy is old enough to consult a doctor without 
                              fear of extra embarrassing complications. One boy who requested circumcision 
                              for painful adhesions at the age of 13 was advised to wait. 
                              Boys, and especially those with painful conditions, are quite capable 
                              of deciding for themselves at puberty if they want to be circumcised.                            
                            <P>Rare, but significant is a paraphimosis: when the phimotic ring 
                  gets stuck behind the glans, causing the glans to swell up. This is 
                  a medical emergency and though it can be manually controlled, the usual 
                  sequence of events is Mum being horrified, rushing kid to hospital, 
                  where he is promptly circumcised.- If this isn`t a shock initiation 
                  then I dont know what is!

                              During puberty and masturbation, the pain from a frenulum which is 
                              too short can usually be avoided <I><A HREF="library/passages/frenular-lebenslauf.html#start">e.g.13</A></I> "When masturbating, if I didn`t watch out and pulled the skin back 
                              too far, it was sometimes pretty painful around the frenulum, added 
                              to which especially to start with the frenulum skin would tear. These 
                              small wounds healed very badly, ... when I didnt really shake out all 
                              the urine, drops got under the foreskin and then it burnt even more" </P>
                            <P><I><A HREF="library/passages/ignored-frenulum.html#start">e.g.14</A></I> "I often had pain when trying to fully retract my foreskin. I often 
                              wondered what to do about it but mostly ignored the problem. After 
                              all, when masturbating that didn't cause a problem, and when having 
                              sex with women I always had used condomes so far. Using condomes, the 
                              foreskin wouldn't retract that much and it caused no big problem." 
                              (<I>RS note that during masturbation this pain was "often wondered 
                                about" and also "ignored"</I>)

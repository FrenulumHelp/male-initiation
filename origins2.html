          male circumcision. Most of the literature shows no awareness 
          of phimosis - its frequency - or the sexual and erectile problems which can be cured by circumcision. If routine circumcision 
          had been introduced for this most obvious reason of eliminating difficult 
          foreskins; then the importance of an alternative modern method, suitable to our culture's attitudes in this day and age, would be clear. </FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                            </B></FONT>Partial circumcision is the oldest culturally practised routine operation. 
                              This operation is the foundation stone of surgical tradition in Western medicine. Consider the cultural importance of 
                              circumcision from the point of view of medical development in Western cultures. <A HREF="chinese_medicine.html#start">Compare this with traditional chinese medicine</A> which never uses surgery and never practiced circumcision.</P>
                            <P><FONT SIZE="4"><B>THE BASIC RIDDLE<BR>
                            </B></FONT>The Encyclopaedia Britannica describes how : &quot;The origin 
                              of the practice is unknown . . the quite widely preferred early 
                              use of a stone knife rather than a metal one suggest the great antiquity 
                              of the operation&quot; <A HREF="library/xtras/refs.html#ref34">(34)</A>. 
                              It is generally acknowledged that routine circumcision originated 
                              among the hunting tribes in the late stone age previous to the beginning 
                              of cultivation. This dates the origin of the practice between 12,000 and 50,000 
                              years old.
                            <P>It has often been suggested to me that the Jews must know why 
                              they circumcise. The Encyclopaedia Judaica itself states that &quot;its 
                              origin is shrouded in mystery&quot; <A HREF="library/xtras/refs.html#ref33">(33)</A>. 
                               The operation 
                              originated in pre-literate times, the Biblical tradition is a relatively late development. No culture which performs the 
                              rite traditionally can state the origins of the custom in any 
                              way which explains it to the scientific thinker. </P>
                            <P>It would be more than a little naive to imagine that our Stone Age 
                              ancestors were chaotic barbarians, such a common custom must have an 
                              intelligence, or at least a sense in it. </P>
                            <P>The modern anthropologist regards circumcision as an unsolvable 
                              mystery. Modern theories assume that the practice was based on a number of combined factors. </P>
                            <P>Phimosis was refuted  because a) the 
                              natural peoples did not appreciate the association between the penis, semen and 
                              fertility (anthropologists assumed that the problem with phimosis is that it hinders semen emission) and b) phimosis is thought to be a rarity, however this opinion was established previous to any statistical studies.                             
                            <P>Modern writers never mention phimosis.  Since 1960 any discussion 
                              of phimosis as origin for circumcision has vanished from the books.- 
                              (The ommission by Bettelheim and Eliade`s Encyclopedia of Religion being 
                              notable recent examples). 
                            <P><A NAME="enigma"></A><FONT SIZE="4"><B> The Independant Origins<BR>
                            </B></FONT>Though the operation sometimes spread, part of the puzzle is the independent origination of the practice in a great number of completely separate 
                              areas of the world.                            </P>

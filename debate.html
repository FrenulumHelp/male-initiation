        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

                                            <P> <B>The question: should all boys be circumcised or not, is an extraordinarily

                                    <P>The debate for and against circumcision is not new to the world, 
                                      it has probably been going on since the operation was first introduced. 
                                      Modern times and Internet has merely exaggerated the fronts, so 
                                      that nowadays instead of partial circumcision being debated, the 
                                      pro circs. want full circumcision, and the anti circs. want nothing 
                                      at all.</P>
                                    <P>Both sides are so sure they know the truth, and both sides feel 
                                      so right in their assumptions that they feel justified in ignoring 
                                      contrary evidence. </P>
                                    <P>Before getting on line I had never seriously considered the question 
                                      "Should all boys be circumcised or none?" It seemed (and still seems) 
                                      a totally irrelevant question for a culture which has the intelligence 
                                      and eyes to make a specific ands individual diagnosis, checking young children and in the individual 
                                      cases where something was wrong to treat accordingly and specifically. </P>
                                    <P>The debate between those who support circumcision and those who 
                                      are against it, is the singular most destructive factor to clear thinking 
                                      about circumcision. It misleads parents and every ordinary listener 
                                      to believe that there is a routine answer which applies to every boy, 
                                      and it misleads concerned parents to an uncertainty and unnecessary 
                                      worry about if to circumcise or not.

  On the one side the pro-circers say with irrefutable logic "if kids 
                                      were all circumcised, they wouldn`t have any problems" (cut off 
                                      their heads and they never get headaches) ... this perversion of the 
                                      normal sense of preventative medicine is balanced on the other hand 
                                      by the anti circers who, basing there arguments on simple civil rights, they go to the extreme of maintaining foreskin problems are a rarity, 
                                which heal spontaneously, or can be treated as an adult if any individual so chooses. (which I as well as the pro circs. who are as aware of the problems as I am, find simply too late sometimes after years of embarrassing problems, arguing that a child needs early care). </P>
                                <P>The pros emphasise infections, - they tend to leave foreskin conditions 
                                      out of the argument (probably because they realise that such can be 
                                      cured without full circumcision - infections cancer and aids are the 
                                      only possibly valid arguments for full circumcision). The antis prefer 
                                      to minimise all and every problem with the foreskin because it could 
                                      indicate a reason to operate, and so are happy to comply with ignoring 
                                      foreskin conditions - and so has followed years and years of irrelevant 
                                      debate about irrelevant infections. 
                                <P>While the pro-circers generally approve of checking boys (and 
                                      then circumcising any with possible problems), for the anti-circ. 
                                      sources checking implies medical interference and as phimosis is 
                                      (supposedly) a rarity and doctors checking the foreskin causes "iatrogenic" 
                                      problems (i.e. problems caused by a doctor), they recommend that 
                                      foreskins and the penis are best to leave alone or ignore (<A HREF="library/xtras/refs.html#ref23">23</A>, <A HREF="library/xtras/refs.html#ref24">24</A>) and eventually around 
                                      the age of 17 most of the problems will somehow have resolved by 
                                      themselves. 
                                <P> (If you check, all references to this theory about problems resolving 
                                      spontaneously at 17 are referred to and based on one medical study 
                                      by &Oslash;ster, however the interpretation given is always the surface 
                                      one. <A HREF="re_oster.html#start">&Oslash;ster himself describes how 
                                        he educated and monitored his youths for 7 years and it was only after 
                                        this care and education that he was able to record the lowest phimosis 
                                        statistic in available medical history.)</A>
                                <P>Almost everyone who is actively involved with this subject has either 
                                      an anti or pro circumcision bias. And though scientific arguments are 
                                      presented it is obvious that a personal experience 
                                      lies at the basis of a rationalisation : some men were circumcised as babies and 
                                      not infrequently the operation was done badly; on the other hand some 
                                      men needed circumcision and were thankful once they received it mostly 
                                      as adult. <B>For some circumcision was a mutilation; while for others 
                                      it was a blessing.</B> 
                                <P>Both groups have a number of medical doctors and university trained 
                                      men writing studies and papers which provide the necessary scientific 
                                      "proof". And I wish to note again my astonishment that so many doctors 
                                      support one or other of these extremist diametrically opposed opinions. 
                                      Writing now in 1998, Sch&ouml;berlein in 1966 was the last doctor to 
                                      emphasise the wisdom of pre puberty checks. </P>
                                    <P>This site was the first "not strictly" anti-circ. site on line, 
                                      and regardless the logic that I wanted boys checked and therefore I 
                                      didn`t want them automatically routinely circumcised, just the mere 
                                      mention that individually a circumcision could be necessary, prompted 
                                      a lot of extremely horrible letters from anti circers, and a lot of 
                                      inappropriate support letters from pro circers. (there are now around 
                                      12 real pro circ. sites, and my hate mail from the <I>antis</I> and my <I>pro</I> support mail 
                                    has diminished accordingly).                                     
                                    <P>How very confusing it all was, - the only 
                                      people talking "openly" about male circumcision were extremists lost 
                                      in an all or nothing, for or against, black and white question. Even 
                                      so called moderates would define themselves in these one dimensional 
                                      terms, saying they tend towards being anti. or pro. - clearly recorded 
                                      on the Deja NewsGroups one man (a qualified psychologist and anthropologist) who wrote he started 
                                out pro then became anti and is now more pro again!                                    
                                    <P> If it wasnt so sad, it would be fascinating how both extremes 
                                      suggest routine approaches with no consideration for appropriate individual 
                                      measures. And it is here I believe that the antis are making the big 
                                      mistake in their thinking - they play into the pros hands exactly by 
                                      trying to minimise the problems and present a routine answer, - instead 
                                      of emphasising individual solutions to individual problems depending 
                                      on the degree of severity etc., as in other branches of modern medicine<B>:-</B> individual patient related treatment.

                                    <P><B>My discussion with the PRO-Circers.</B> <I>in some detail </I>
                                    <P>The pro-circumcision argument is that infant circumcision provides 
                                a valid prevention against infections and diseases. They are generally 
                                aware that foreskin conditions dont require full circumcision, it is 
                                probably for this reason that they emphasise disease infection even 
                                cancer and AIDS arguing that a full circumcision is the best prevention 
                                of these. Even for foreskin conditions individual treatment is not 
                                considered, the modern options of corrective stretching, betamethasone, 
                                frenoplasty and/or the traditional cures of partial circumcision, a 
                                dorsal slit, or frenular incision are rarely recommended. 
                              <P>Modern technical engineering and plastics have enabled pro circ 
                                doctors to develop modern methods for performing full circumcision 
                                on even the tiny infant penis. The Tara Clamp has recently been added 
                                to Plastiibell and gomco clamp and is praised as being able to perform 
                                the perfect infant cut. 
                              <P>It is often argued that UTIs (Urinary Tract Infections) happen 10% 
                                more in uncircumcised boys. What does 10% more mean?<BR>
                                Are we talking about 10% more than 1 in 6 or 10% more than 1 in 
                                60,000. - What does "10% more" actually mean in terms of how often 
                                problems of this sort are occurring? 
                              <P>This question has been on-line since 1996 and no pro circ. source 
                                has responded. When confronted, the only answer I have received has 
                                been - </P>
                              <P>... &quot;Its AIDS, penis cancer infections etc. all added together.&quot; 
                              <P>I writhe in agony, please give a reliable answer which you can argue 
                                in some way. The important question to me is: Do foreskin related infections 
                                and diseases occur more than 1% of the total time?<BR>
                                I have never seen any reliable statistics. I have never found a pro-circumcision 
                                doctor or supporter who can give an answer, - is this true? are there 
                                no reliable statistics? - I know pro-circers read this, if you post 
                                me some sort of reliable figures then I`ll print them or link up with 
                                them! - (It is now 2005 - I have still received no answer) 
                              <P>Again I have never seen, read or heard any reliable statistics - 
                                and this is ridiculous when considering child health care.<BR>
                                <BR>
                                <B>On the other hand</B> every pro circer who I have corresponded with has freely expressed 
                                their agreement that 10% of the uncircumcised male population have 
                                phimosis. - Such statistics are confirmed in <A HREF="statistics.html#start">The 
                                  Encyclopedia of Phimosis Statistics</A>, which is my collection of all 
                                the statistical studies on phimosis since 1920.</P>
                              <P>Surely if care for children is foremost in our thinking it would 
                                be appropriate to help make our culture aware of these <I>common</I> conditions 
                                which can be checked for. Surely you can continue any debate about a possible 
                                general advisability of circumcising every child or none as a prevention 
                                against infection for further centuries, once these proven actual common 
                                problems have been resolved. 
                              <P>In countries which are limited in their health care possibilities 
                                it would seem practical for pro circumcision sources to recommend a 
                                routine dorsal slit, - a dorsal slit would be most efficient cheap 
                                quick and practical, requiring minimal after care or expertise from 
                                the operator, allowing the glans to harden early against infection 
                                to comply with your apparent main caring intention, protecting children 
                                from infection.</P>
                              <P>Some pro-circers have complained of the price of checking children, 
                                In this respect note that a dorsal slit would again fulfil your arguments. 
                              <P>One significant comment came from a pro-circer who told me 
                                that the circumcised penis turned him on. This might well be a secret 
                                truth and also one of the most valid reasons for performing the operation. 
                                ...  and from 
                                this perspective I could imagine the pro-circ movement would have some 
                                success, indeed from this perspective I would wish them success, ... the denuded penis is more interesting with more diversity of forms and texture of skin surface and thus a more interesting symbol of maleness, ... but in a modern culture which respects individual rights this choice must be made as an adult and 
                                NOT simply routinely peformed on infants. 
                              <P><A NAME="weiss"></A>Dr. Gerald N. Weiss, M.D. has written countless 
                                pro-circumcision publications and argues that babies do not feel pain 
                                when circumcised without anaesthetic, and masturbation (which often 
                                requires lubrication among the circumcised) is an unnatural substitute 
                                for intercourse. When one man stands at the head of the pro-circumcision 
                                campaign it is this doctor.

  > &ldquo;Congratulations on your research on circumcision! I find it really 
                                deplorable that this uncomplicated but thus so beneficial operation 
                                is losing population so rapidly in our days. I am a 24 year old medical 
                                student from Germany and I have spent 18 years of my life with a foreskin...and 
                                with it with a great many problems. I am circumcised now and more than 
                                happy about it. I wish circumcision was the norm here in Germany, because 
                                it is - as you might know - very unpopular here. In my med school here 
                                circumcision is not even taught. Wish you all the best for your research,

  "... the importance of this anecdote cannot be overlooked - This potential

                                on account of his personal experiences. We see very clearly here how 
                                personal prejudice on this subject can influence medical opinion and 
                                practice." 
                              <P>Dr. Weiss made no answer to this comment and also made no answer

                                can only deduce that all your argumentation is based on the personal preference, 
                                i.e. basicly that you like the look of the circumcised penis.

                                </B>From an ethical or moral standpoint, RIC - Routine Infant Circumcision 
                                is certainly an infringement of personal rights. And where anti-circ 
                                sources are most certainly correct is when discussing their own field 
                                of experience: RIC - Routine Infant Circumcision.                               
                              <P>Unfortunately often anti-circumcision sources make assumptions about the value of the foreskin thereby minimising any problems.                              
                              <P>I would love to communicate and link up to a site which was against 
                                RIC without being against circumcision or other foreskin and frenulum 
                                operations. At present all anti circ. sites proliferate the idea 
                                of ignoring foreskin problems <A HREF="library/xtras/refs.html#ref24">(24)</A> or leaving a growing boy's penis alone <A

                              - <BR>
                              <I>(Please give any new links - I stopped online research in 2000) </I>
                              <P>While I agree with your goals, your reasoning and approach are unrealistic. 
                                I am afraid that because you feel morally or ethically correct you 
                                are making the various mistakes of the self righteous where any means 
                                justifies the end. 
                              <P>It is ironical 
                                but anit-circ sources appear to be  damaging their own cause by developing and spreading new 
                                myths and untruths - and thus maintaining the taboos and ignorance.
                              <P>Please see <A HREF="myths.html#start"><B>Anti-Circ Theory</B></A>                              
                              for a summary text which is easier to read than the following 
                              <P>NEW FANTASIES to CONFUSE me MORE and MORE <BR>
                                I believe if your information had been planned to prolonge the 
                                chaos for doctors and patients for another hundred years, then it could 
                                not have been better planned. 
                                It is often totally irrational - and it is frustrating to try and argue rationally against such angry emotions.
                              <P>Most anti circers will admit that they have never experienced a 
                                foreskin and know little about how they work, - however they have &quot;researched&quot; 
                                and present a set of ideas on how the "normal" foreskin works, and 
                                then present theories and advice for parents on how to care for the 
                                uncircumcised child! 
                              <P>People must learn to think about this subject clearly and with common 
                                sense, not with mumbo jumbo.                              
                              <P>Please see <A HREF="myths.html#start">The Anti-Circ Theory</A> which discusses Taylor`s &quot;highly sensitive&quot; ridged 
                                band. Information for parents and 
                                children in more than a hundred internet sites is based on this one study 
                                of 22 dead bodies. 
                              <P>The phimotic ring is referred to by many anti circumcision 
                                www sites as either Taylors ridged band or the frenar band. The word <I>frenar</I> can easily be 
                                confused with<I> frenulum</I>. How can this help clarity and education?
                              <P>All anti circ sites I have seen ignore refences to all 26 collected studies on 
                                the frenulum - all except for one by Paul M. Fleiss, MD <A HREF="library/xtras/refs.html#ref90">90</A> this is still referenced and quoted by every important anti-circ. site.

                              <P>In the flaccid state, the foreskin covers

                                    who are born without frenulums and those who have had it removed, the 
                                foreskin covers the glans of its own accord, by its own &quot;weight-bundle&quot;. 
                              It is obvious that during erection a  healthy frenulum does not hold the foreskin forward. ...

                                      least one aspect of the basic fear and <B>mystery</B> about circumcision will 
                                        <B>justifiably remain</B>, and almost logically and understandably, <B>this mystery will continue 
                                      to have irrational consequences</B> - (e.g. baby boys being circumcised 
                                      for no reason).</P>

                              <P>Lastly,<BR>
                                If routine circumcision or no circumcision is more ridiculous or even 
                                dangerous is an irrelevant and bizarrly misleading question. Because,</P>
                              <P><B>A diagnosis of any malformation is possible and advantageous 
                                before puberty, before the majority of the problems have occurred.</B></P>
                              <P> If boys were monitored, the anti-circers idea of conservative treatment 
                                would then have a realistic basis, and instead of a hurried operation, there would be ample time to encourage 
                                preventative stretching - use of steroid creams - educate about paraphimosis 
                                - previous to the last operative resort. </P>
                              <P>If any anti.circ source feels they can respond to my criticism 
                                I will link up with or print your ideas ...

                              <P>"I am wholeheartedly in favour of checking boys well before puberty 
                                to give them the best chance of entering puberty with a fully functioning 
                                penis. 
                              <P>"Quite apart from the specific need to check for genital development 
                                and knowledge before puberty, I have long felt that all children should 
                                have regular complete medical checkups (at least every 2-3 years). 
                                Detailed examination of the genitals should be included in these checks 
                                and the opportunity taken to get corrective action as early as possible 
                                when any problems are found."

                                                  Occasional individual anti circers have said they have nothing against 
                                                  checking, some have said they favour checking but that I should 
                                                  include the checking of circumcised boys. 
                                <P><A HREF="circumcision/ric_check.html#start">I agree and have now 
                                                  started collecting information on this subect</A>. I feel I still 
                                                  do not know enough about the problems of a circumcised penis to 
                                                  be able to advise parents on this, so please tell me your personal 
                                                  experiences. 
                                <P> I would find it far more appropriate for one of the anti circ sites 
                                                  to consider a section on the subject of checking circumcised boys, 
                                                  I would happily link to such a site.

                                <P>And just a closing note from 2007 - The antis are far more emotionally involved; the pros are cool and rational and really enjoy winding the antis. up, which drives the debate to extremes which suits the pro-circ. cause far better. I always wished the antis would see that the simplest way to break the circle is to demand individual treatment, (even if this occasionally means an individual circumcision) ... but im a dreamer ... </TD></TR></TABLE></TD>

        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. During erection these conditions inhibit the relationship between foreskin and glans. This functionally 
          restricts the erection, and thus has an effect on the sexuality. With 
          our culture's attitudes on health care, it would be appropriate to monitor 
          boys before puberty and encourage early prevention.<br><BR>
  2012 : note from author:  My previous idea of monitoring boys before puberty is impractical, unecessary and now only of historical interest.  please see <a href="../postscript.html#start">Postscript</a>.</FONT></P>         </TD></TR></TABLE>         </TD></TR></TABLE>

Very Much Under Construction AND definitely NOT intended as advice

Adults may be able to use the probe check, however this could be dangerous 
if any infection was present: 
                              <H3>EXPERIMENTAL START of THE PROBE CHECK</H3>
                              <B>INTRODUCTION</B><BR>
Intelligence and carefullness are necessary in order to diagnose with 
a probe. No responsibility is taken for any damage you may do to yourself 
as a result of reading this information. If you doubt your ability 
to be careful and sensible, please go to a doctor. I would welcome 
any advice from a urologist to complete this section.
<P> Re read the summary of the conditions, be sure of what you are 
  looking for. Be wise, and check you understand everything before starting 
<P> <B>THE PROBE CHECK</B><BR>
  If retraction is impossible due to a phimosis, it would normally require 
  a certain expertise and practice to continue with the diagnosis. With 
  the help of a blunted, rounded, sterilised probe, an urologist is able 
  to ascertain the position and nature of any further constriction. 
<P> DO NOT use this probe to PROD around. Move the probe slowly and 
  carefully so as not to break any remains of infant adhesions. 
<P>The only usual household equipment which resembles a urlogical probe 
  in shape and size is a q-tip, but here the cotton wool is far too abrasive 
  and it doesn't slide as easily between the foreskin and glans as the 
  smooth plastic of an urological probe would. Even a bit of simple oil 
  or incidently saliva which sticks the cotton wool together ... ) only 
  diminishes the friction. (I cannot advise using q-tips, but they might 
  be the only thing you've got,...)... One should use a special urological 
  probe, and this is essential for examinations on children. Remember 
  that the glans is especially sensitive in cases where it has never 
  been exposed. 
<P>PLEASE PRACTICE: with the tip of your tongue held between your lips, 
  take the probe and move it round your tongue. If you drag it, (if you 
  are using a q-tip despite my warnings), it will rub. Now ROLL the probe 
  between your finger tips, then ROLL it round your tongue, it might 
  tickle a bit, but it's a far more pleasant experience. 
<P>In your mouth, rolling the probe around the tongue, will be easier 
  than rolling it around your lips, and here the analogy ceases to apply. 
  On the penis, you will need to roll the probe around the foreskin, 
  NOT around the glans. This rolling action will stop the probe catching 
  on any folds of skin.<BR>
<P>Gently insert the probe on the side of the penis. The healthiest 
  and simplest possibility is that there will be no obstructions between 
  the foreskin and the glans. 
<P>One must be especially careful due to infant adhesions. These adhesions 
  can be bonded over a large or smaller area, they usually release last 
  in the area around the frenulum. Move the probe slowly carefully rolling 
  it around the foreskin. If the foreskin starts to pull off the glans 
  this will be painful, at the first implication of pain stop the examination. 
  Though a specialist may sometimes use force to break these adhesions, 
  they will then need after care. If you break the adhesions while the 
  area is covered with a phimosis, this will be particularly difficult 
  to care for. 
<P>Skin bridges may have formed at any place between the foreskin and 
  the glans. You will be able to move the probe on either side of this 
  strip or string of skin. To confirm the presence of a skin bridge, 
  a second curved probe may be necessary to examine behind the obstruction. 
<P> If you have phimosis it is very difficult to check the frenulum. 
  This is particularly true at present because (sorry but) I haven't 
  a clue how the urologists do it! 
<P>All I assume at present, is when there is no obstruction, there 
  is no frenulum breve, whereas a healthy frenulum forms a flap or ridge 
  which blocks the movement of the probe 
<P>How this sheet of skin moves or feels when it is too short, and 
  covered by a phimosis is a mystery to me.         </TD></TR></TABLE></TD>

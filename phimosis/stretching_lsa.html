        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. My concern is the early prevention of phimosis. The late correction of adult phimosis was never my interest. My belief is that once the medical profession realise the need, they will develop hundreds of new methods of treatment which I cant even imagine ... Therefore treatment  is  purely an appendix on this site, however, because I have no specific bias, my research allowed a rare objective survey of the many posibilities. </FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site offers  detailed information 
          on  individual problem related treatment, often advising simple, cheap, minimal and specific surgery and time honoured solutions taken from traditional methods including partial circumcision, dorsal slit and frenular incision and tying.

                                .... my foreskin has become much much looser than it ever has been 
                                before. The other week I noticed that I had a developed some tearing 
                                of my foreskin on one side and so I have taken it a little easier over 
                                the last few days.</P>
                              <P>If I don't stretch it for a few days I have noticed that it has 
                                a tendency to tighten up again. Interestingly enough though, to get 
                                it to where it was (post stretching era) is not as difficult the second 
                                time around as it was when I started out (pre stretching era).<BR>

                                Hi Paul,<BR>
                                I've a couple of thoughts,</P>
                              <P>If your phimosis was since birth, it was not <BR>
                                caused by LSA, and therefore it will stretch.</P>
                              <P>LSA: lichen sclerosus atrophicus... Lichen means some sort of mixture <BR>
                                between fungi and algae, sclerosus means scarring, atrophic means <BR>
                                degenerative, --- it seems simple phimotic rings stretch, but when 
                                they <BR>
                                are connected with &quot;degenerative fungal scarrings&quot; (LSA) 
                                they don't</P>
                              <P>At times a simple phimotic ring can degenerate to a &quot;lichenoid 
                                phimosis&quot; <BR>
                                --- By stretching what we're doing is reversing or preventing this <BR>
                                atrophic (degenerative) process.</P>
                              <P>From what I've heard a simple phimotic ring doesn't give up, once <BR>
                                stretched it needs stretching every couple of days ... but you'll find 
                                it <BR>
                                gets easier to stretch, ... its on the way to regenerating</P>
                              <P>Are you still with me? -</P>
                              <P>The question is now, how does one prevent LSA from developing?</P>
                              <P>I've been wondering about the rips, ... I've heard people saying 
                                that when<BR>
                                a phimosis rips it gets worse ... lets think sensibly, ... when once 
                                my <BR>
                                phimotic ring ripped it bled, - lets imagine its a rip like anywhere 
                                else<BR>
                                on the skin, .. when I bleed there is a scar afterwards, when I was 
                                10 the<BR>
                                scar was gone in a day, when I was 40 it took a week ... so I don't 
                                think<BR>
                                ripping in itself is going to permanently tighten the phimosis (except 
                                in<BR>
                                older age) ... but rips, and open wounds can pick up other infections 
                                ...</P>
                              <P>So, here I return to your first question (in private mail), the 
                                use of<BR>
                                creams,</P>
                              <P>If the phimosis will stretch then creams would help this ... I don't 
                                know<BR>
                                which creams, .... but surely most important would be a bit of Dean's <BR>
                                lubrication jelly to help prevent the skin from ripping in the first 
                                place.</P>
                              <P>An interesting question would be what sort of antiseptic, or<BR>
                                anti-lichenoid cream could actually prevent or reverse any lichenoid<BR>
                                process.</P>
                              <P>Wearing the foreskin retracted to keep the area dry may be the simplest 
                                method,.</P>
                              <P>Just a few thoughts, hope you can follow me, ..<BR>
                                Good Luck Robin<BR>

                              <P>Hi to all-<BR>
                                I find this quite interesting as stretching is something I started 
                                years ago<BR>
                                and have found it to work quite well. The lubricant Robin mentioned 
                                is<BR>
  &quot;Astroglide&quot; and it is as close to the natural lubricant 
                                as can be formulated-<BR>
                                and works quite well. I have also found that Vaseline Intensive Care 
                                lotion<BR>
                                provides healing for minor irritations on the foreskin.</P>
                              <P>As to stretching- I even do it at night when waking up with an erection- 
                                so<BR>
                                my recommendation is to stretch daily-- it becomes rather pleasurable 
                                so is not<BR>
                                a 'burden' to do it and the benefits are great!! After once having 
                                such a<BR>
                                tight foreskin- now to be able to fully retract when erect without 
                                even a<BR>
  &quot;ring&quot; is quite nice.</P>
                              <P>good luck<BR>
                                dean<BR>

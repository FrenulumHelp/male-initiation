        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. My concern is the early prevention of phimosis. The late correction of adult phimosis was never my interest. My belief is that once the medical profession realise the need, they will develop hundreds of new methods of treatment which I cant even imagine ... Therefore treatment  is  purely an appendix on this site, however, because I have no specific bias, my research allowed a rare objective survey of the many posibilities. </FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site offers  detailed information 
          on  individual problem related treatment, often advising simple, cheap, minimal and specific surgery and time honoured solutions taken from traditional methods including partial circumcision, dorsal slit and frenular incision and tying. 
          - (Links are given where appropriate to sites dealing with the modern solutions of preputial plasty  and  full-circumcision).</FONT></P></TD>

                                      practical early conservative preventative measure for boys with &quot;phimosis&quot;.</P></TD>

                              <P>I believe Betamethasone and Clobetasol Propionate are effective 
                                methods of treatment in a certain percentage of cases. My criticism 
                                is that parents should not be advised to experiment with steroids on 
                                children, until conclusive, scientific, uncontradictory studies have 
                                been performed, and the methods tried and tested, long term on adults. </P>
                              <P>The experimental use of steroids to treat children - is a lot of 
                                mess and upset AND it creates the impression that something is wrong, 
                                - doctors visits and use of creams from a tube is what happens when 
                                something is infected, ... and children arent stupid.</P>
                              <P>Individual adults or parents who ecstatically praise steroids as 
                                the new wonder cure will not change my attitude - until methods have 
                                been developed and tried and conclusively tested on adults, then parents 
                                or doctors should not encourage experiments with creams on children. </P>
                              <P>For those parents who for whatever reasons wish to ignore my advice, 
                                concerning these medical studies .... one problem is that retraction 
                                was only measurable in the flaccid state... the other good point 
                                on beta .05 is ... it seems there are no known bad side effects ... </P>
                              <P>Also interesting is perhaps betamethasone can help release epithelial 
                                adhesions - (<A HREF="../dissolve.html#start">see Dissolve</A>) </P>                              </TD>

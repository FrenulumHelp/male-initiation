        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. My concern is the early prevention of phimosis. The late correction of adult phimosis was never my interest. My belief is that once the medical profession realise the need, they will develop hundreds of new methods of treatment which I cant even imagine ... Therefore treatment  is  purely an appendix on this site, however, because I have no specific bias, my research allowed a rare objective survey of the many posibilities. </FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site offers  detailed information 
          on  individual problem related treatment, often advising simple, cheap, minimal and specific surgery and time honoured solutions taken from traditional methods including partial circumcision, dorsal slit and frenular incision and tying.

                              <P>Any doctor reading this with alternative suggestions - please contact <A HREF="http://f51.parsimony.net/forum204498/" TARGET="_blank">ARCgroup 
                                forum</A>
                              <P><B>FLACCID EXAMINATION</B>
                              <P>The doctor examines for foreskin conditions in the flaccid state, 
                                many would not even consider the erectile effects. Doctors do not 
                                generally realise as <A HREF="../library/medicus/wabrek.html#start">Wabrek</A> eventually did "... just because the foreskin slides over the flaccid 
                                penis does not mean it is going to slide over the erect penis." <A HREF="../library/medicus/wabrek.html#start"></A> Without a good knowledge of your own condition, there is a justifyable 
                                fear of inaccurate diagnosis and being offered an unecssary full 
                                circumcision as the only option. 
                              <P> Even erection stimulants will not show the erectile effects. As <A HREF="../library/medicus/wabrek.html#start">Wabrek</A> realised, 
                                diagnosis is simplest and is far more accurate by talking. However, 
                                maybe discussing intimate details is an unecessary embarrassment 
                                for you and your doctor. 
                              <P>Ok so Doctors are usually reasonable people and if you talk with 
                                them in a practical way then they will respond positively. 
                              <P>The important point and attitude to adopt about <A HREF="../diagnosis.html#start">a 
                                self diagnosis</A> is that you understand your condition enough, 
                                - to make it worth a doctor discussing treatment with you in an intelligent 
                                manner, instead of simply and usually recommending circumcision - 
                                with you left clueless and unhappy. 
                              <P><B>WHICH DOCTOR ... (did I say Witch Doctor?)</B>
                              <P><B>Jewish Doctor for Partial Circumcision</B> <BR>
                                The doctors who are practised and perfected with partial circumcision 
                                are Jewish doctors. Please see <A HREF="../partial_circumcision.html#start">Partial 
                                  Circumcision</A>
                              <P><B>Dermatologists</B> - "skin doctors" are the specialists for methods 
                                and ointments which will stretch skin. We`re not talking about internal 
                                things (in which the urologist is very well versed) --- Besides which 
                                they regularly have to deal with VD problems balanitis etc. so they`re 
                                probably far more used to looking at foreskins than urologists and 
                                surgeons are 
                              <P><B>SURGERY<BR>
                                </B>If you want any sort of operation, go to a surgeon. Surgeons are 
                                the experts for cutting. I used to advise going to the urologists, 
                                one imagines that this is the urologists special field, but urologists 
                                receive no training on the function of the foreskin, only on internal 
                                organs. 
                              <P>Frenulum treatment is no problem for an Urologist. Every urologist 
                                has learned how to do this piece of professional plastic surgery 
                                - even circumcision with modern helpers (plastibells etc.) is technically 
                                an incredibly simple operation and they have often learned a method 
                                passed down from a senior doctor. And this is the point, a surgeon 
                                would be far more likely to know any latest developments. 
                              <P>For a half hour operation the individual doctor is understandably 
                                unwilling to spend a couple of hours devising a specific new operation 
                                and then taking responsibility that it`ll work. 
                              <P>If you want a special operation, plastic surgery etc. then it will 
                                probably cost, and a cosmetic surgeon may be best - someone who does 
                                breast surgery would probably feel he was an appropriate doctor. 
                              <P><B>APPROACH<BR>
                                </B>Dont try and impress them with scientific names, doctors dont 
                                like this, I suggest you call phimosis - the ring<B> : </B>and frenulum 
                                - the band - if you can admit to some of the typical symptoms and 
                                then say its something to do with the band or ring - then you and 
                                he can be happy as he confirms your diagnosis. 
                              <P>Doctors seem to quite like their patients bringing in recent relevant 
                                medical studies - they have so much new to learn all the time and 
                                so actually seem to appreciate being presented with new solutions 
                                from the meical literature. - (naturally they`d prefer the original 
                                literature to extracts from my site - but I dont have fax so the 
                                only other suggestion is go to <A HREF="../medicus.html#start">medline</A>).
                              <P>And then be friendly, practical and un-embarrassed and say "I`d 
                                like to try Betamethasone 05 to cure a phimotic ring, here it says 
                                in <A HREF="../steroids.html#start">these medical studies</A> that it 
                                often works - (or can you refer me to a dermatologist)" OR "Hi Doc. 
                                I`ve got a minor phimosis problem and I`d appreciate it if you`d 
                                put <A HREF="../phimosis_studies.html#houdelette">2 or 3 plastic 
                              cuts</A> in it - (or refer me to a good surgeon)."</TD>

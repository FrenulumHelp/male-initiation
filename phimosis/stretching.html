        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site discusses phimosis in its specific forms of phimotic ring, frenulum breve, adhesions or skinbridges. My concern is the early prevention of phimosis. The late correction of adult phimosis was never my interest. My belief is that once the medical profession realise the need, they will develop hundreds of new methods of treatment which I cant even imagine ... Therefore treatment  is  purely an appendix on this site, however, because I have no specific bias, my research allowed a rare objective survey of the many posibilities. </FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="2">This site offers  detailed information 
          on  individual problem related treatment, often advising simple, cheap, minimal and specific surgery and time honoured solutions taken from traditional methods including partial circumcision, dorsal slit and frenular incision and tying.

                              A note which could be helpful is that many men report successful 
 stretching in the shower ... I wonder if steam and humidity could 
 have an effect?

                              <P>If stretching works -- you will only achieve a temporary improvement. 
                                One must keep stretching a phimotic ring after a few days it will simply 
                                start closing up again. On the other hand, this daily stretching will 
                                become easier and may turn into an enjoyable pastime. If its no fun 
                                to stretch then change the method ...</P>
                              <P>When the skin becomes less flexible in old age, some men who previously 
                                had no difficulty with retraction, with relatively regular sex, can 
                                become quite unable to retract even when flaccid. Lubricants and creams 
                                may ease the situation, however it is apparent that anyone who had 
                                needed to keep the foreskin stretched throughout his entire life, would 
                                almost certainly be faced with a surgical correction in old age.</P>
                              <P>Having said this, weighing the possibilities that in 40 years either 
                                you might be dead or medicine will have developed various new treatments 
                                for phimosis, then the experience of several men indicates that it 
                                is worth stretching.</P>

                                three or four years- My urologist had recommended that I start using 
                                Astro Glide (a wonderful lubricant that looks/feels/tastes like the

                                the restoration--It occurred to me that if someone without one could 
                                stretch enough to develop something akin to a foreskin--then why couldn't 
                                I stretch mine so that it was not so restrictive. At the time I started 
                                doing this, I had a definite phimotic ring- at times producing somewhat 
                                of an hour-glass appearance when erect. Today, I have absolutely no 
                                sign of a restriction where this once was and my foreskin is more pliable 
                                and looser than any time in my life. As I said earlier- this method 
                                and etc may not work for anyone else- but for me it has been great- 
                                and I have wondered why I didn't try it earlier</P>

                              <P>John's phimosis started at puberty indicating that this was connected 
                                with LSA.. He was unable to stretch despite the following idea.<BR>
  <BR>
                                I started with 'conventional' attempts at retraction, .... Later I 
                                hit on the idea of inserting small objects into the opening and leaving 
                                them there. In this way I could keep the skin under constant tension, 
                                which I thought would surely cause it to stretch. It did seem to have 
                                some effect, as the object would become easier to remove and insert 
                                after a few days' treatment. ... A further refinement was to use small 
                                cylindrical items which I could wrap tape around to gradually increase 
                                the diameter. ... I did continue with this sort of treatment on and 
                                off, and there was a very slight stretching as a result. However, it 
                                really was very slight - I think when I started I could only get a 
                                6mm diameter object in, but this gradually increased to about 10mm. 
                                This improvement probably took a couple of years ...</P>
                              <P>Beauge's methods are reported to start working within the first 
                                weeks, ... after two months, I would suggest either adding steroids 
                                to the treatment, or looking for other treatments.</P>

                              <P>One widely reported method of stretching is by pinching the overhang 
                                and ballooning the foreskin with urine. This is dangerous due to the 
                                pressure on the bladder.<BR>

                                the infants natural method of pulling the foreskin forward. <A HREF="http://www.cirp.org/library/normal/catzel/"
TARGET="_blank">Catzel</A> advises inserting two fingers and pulling 
                                the foreskin outwards. - I would urge doctors to refrain from advising 
                                stretching to parents who do not fully understand the ideas behind 
                                the procedure. One father justified the effects of stretching his sons 
                                foreskin thus : &quot;he also howls when he goes to the dentist&quot;. 
                                Stretching may be more effective in early childhood or infancy, but 
                                the boy himself must do this <B>if he wants to</B>.</P>
                              <P>One should never use force to push or pull back on a boy's foreskin 
                                - this cannot be repeated often enough, there are an extraordinary 
                                amount of people who support the use of forceful stretching exercises 
                                - there are a number of anatomical complications which force may cause, 
                                but quite simply such a first step into manhood would be a truly inappropriate 
                                initiation for our culture. The use of force and pain builds up negative 
                                psychological attitudes about what one is attempting to achieve, i.e. 
                                retracting the foreskin.</P>
                              <P>I would suggest that an appropriate modern initiation would be as 
                                the result of self experiment and self strecthing that a boy would 
                                experience a feeling of excitement and fun at this new discovery 
                                about his own male body.</P></TD>
